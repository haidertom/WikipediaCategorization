'''1GOAL Education for All''' [[Advocacy group|campaign]] is run by the Education Week Foundation. Working with football and the footballing community, 1GOAL raises public awareness and involvement in achieving education for all the 67 million children out of school worldwide. It is supported by over 200 international footballers; over 70 football clubs including [[Manchester United]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[Chelsea FC]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan]], [[AC Milan]], [[Liverpool F.C.]], [[FC Porto]], [[Sporting Lisbon]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; and national and international footballing organisations including the [[Confederation of African Football]], [[FIFPro]], the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] and [[FIFA]].

It was launched by [[Queen Rania]] of [[Jordan]] in August 2009. Alongside Queen Rania, it is co-chaired by [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]] and [[Nobel prize]] [[laureate]] [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article531580.ece/From-the-soccer-pitch-to-the-schoolroom From the soccer pitch to the schoolroom - Another View]; By [[Desmond Tutu]]; Jul 4, 2010; [[Times LIVE]].

It campaigns to secure schooling for some 67 million children worldwide in accordance with the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Goal Promise]] of [[Education for All|education for all]] by 2015. There are several barriers to achieving universal primary education: lack of funds to pay for infrastructure and ongoing costs (buildings, teachers' salaries, learning materials); lack of qualified teachers; conflict and the practice of charging school fees in some developing countries.

As of July 2010, "Twelve million people have signed up to support 1Goal - that makes this the biggest campaign for education in history. [[Association football|Football]] is helping make something very special happen," says ambassador [[Anthony Baffoe]] of [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="1Goal to educate millions"/&gt;

By September 2010, 18 million people had joined 1GOAL. During the UN Millennium Development Goals Review Summit, held in New York, 20–22 September 2010, [[Queen Rania]] delivered this petition directly to UN Secretary General, [[Ban Ki-moon]]. At a 1GOAL event during the same summit, the [[World Bank]] announced an increase of $750 million to education and the Australian Government announced an increase of about $5 billion, of which 70% is ringfenced for primary education.

Many world leaders, footballers and celebrities have supported the initiative including [[Shakira]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Pele]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Michael Essien]], [[Samuel Eto'o]], [[Aaron Mokoena]], [[Quinton Fortune]], [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]] and [[Marcel Desailly]].&lt;ref name="1Goal to educate millions"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2010/06/28/join-to-score-1goal-in-world-cup.html Join to score 1GOAL in World Cup]; June 28, 2010; [[oneindia]].

The '''Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (AJKBISE)''' was established in 1973 through an ordinance promulgated by the [[Government of Azad Kashmir]]. It is located in [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir]]. Before the establishment of the AJK BISE, educational institutes in [[Azad Kashmir]] were included in the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore]] (BISE Lahore).

The first examination was conducted by this Board in 1974, in which 6,161 candidates of [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) &amp; [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSSC) appeared. The scope of its activities gradually increased. The rules and regulations of [[Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Lahore]] have been adopted on the principle of [[Parity (law)|parity]] with [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

'''Appreciative Advising''' (AA) is a social-constructivist advising philosophy that provides a framework for optimizing advisor interactions with students in both individual and group settings.&lt;ref name="The Appreciative Advising Revolution"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bloom, Hutson, &amp; He|title=The Appreciative Advising Revolution|year=2008|publisher=Stipes|location=Urbana-Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart and soul of appreciative advising is the organizational development theory of [[appreciative inquiry]] that was developed in 1979 by David Cooperrider at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Appreciative advising also draws from the [[positive psychology]], [[Social constructivism|social constructivist theory]], and [[Rational choice theory|choice theory]] literature.

== History ==
Appreciative advising emerged from an article written by Jennifer L. Bloom and Nancy Archer Martin titled "Incorporating Appreciative Inquiry into Academic Advising" that appeared in the online academic advising journal at Penn State, ''The Mentor'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dus.psu.edu/mentor/ ''The Mentor'']&lt;/ref&gt; on August 29, 2002.  Subsequently, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) began implementing the concepts outlined in the article and began to demonstrate success in terms of student retention.  Bryant Hutson and Scott Amundsen at UNCG coined the term "appreciative advising". Bloom, Hutson, and He (2008) wrote the first book, titled ''The Appreciative Advising Revolution'', on the topic.  Institutions and academic advisors from throughout the country are now utilizing the appreciative advising approach to guide their advising programs and interactions with students.

In 2012, the University of South Carolina began offering an online Appreciative Advising course as well as a process for certifying appreciative advisers.  Building on the success of the Appreciative approach to academic advising, the movement has expanded to other areas, including teaching (appreciative college instruction), orientation, admissions, Greek life, and tutoring. This expansion of the principles of appreciative advising is now known as appreciative education.

== The core of appreciative advising ==

=== The six phases ===

:'''Disarm'''
:The Disarm phase involves making a positive first impression with students and allaying any fear or suspicion they might have of meeting with the advisor.
:'''Discover'''
:The Discover phase is spent continuing to build rapport with students and learning about their strengths, skills, and abilities through utilizing effective and positive open-ended questions that encourages narratives.
:'''Dream'''
:The Dream phase involves uncovering students' hopes and dreams for their futures.
:'''Design'''
:The Design phase is spent co-creating a plan to make their hopes and dreams come true.
:'''Deliver'''
:The Deliver phase is the implementation phase where students carry out their plan, and the advisor’s role is to support them as they encounter roadblocks.
:'''Don't Settle'''
:The Don't Settle phase involves challenging students to achieve their full potential and supporting them along their journey.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;{{cite web|title=The Six Phases of Appreciative Advising|url=http://AppreciativeAdvising.net|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appreciative advising certification==

===Professional certification===
The University of South Carolina's Office of Appreciative Education now offers a professional rating for academic advisers: Appreciative Advising Certification. Certified Appreciative Advisors are committed to a standard of excellence in the field of advising and optimizing their students' educational experiences. The certification process includes successful attendance of the Appreciative advising Institute or completion of the appreciative advising course, as well as completed advising rubrics, recommendations, a current CV, and personal advising theory.&lt;ref name=Certification&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Certification |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021409/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of certification===
*Advanced professional qualification &lt;ref name=Certification /&gt;
*Increased skills and knowledge
*Raised professional expectations
*Elevated advising experience for students

===Appreciative Advising Institute===
The Appreciative Advising Institute was first held in August 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 2012 Appreciative Advising Institute was held July 28–31 in Charleston, SC. The Institute is intentionally designed to teach participants the theoretical structure of appreciative advising and to provide skills training in implementing this framework. This conference is designed to provide ample opportunity for participants to extend theory to practice.  Participants learn how the six phases help both the advisor and advisee optimize their educational experiences. Participants are encouraged and given the opportunity to reflect on their own goals and dreams to optimize their own lives.&lt;ref name=AAI&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Appreciative Advising Institute |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021400/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appreciative Advising Course===
The Appreciative Advising Course is designed to be a community of learners (instructors included). There are opportunities for participants to interact with other community members each week. This is done via discussion board conversations, as well as optional live chat dialogues. Active participants greatly enhance their own learning experience as well as that of the community. This is an eight-week course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appreciative Advising Course |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924212922/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== More about UNCG's usage of appreciative advising ==

=== Academic recovery programming ===
When students feel academically discouraged, such as when they are on academic probation, they may need to be reminded of the strengths that led them to college in the first place.  Students in academic trouble also typically have a limited time in which to improve their status. Practically, it is quicker to correct this status by building on strengths, and maintaining a course load and engaging in academic and social behaviors that reflect these strengths, than it is to attempt to correct long-standing deficits.  The SAS 100 program at UNCG is a great example of this application. The course features the use of the Appreciative Advising Inventory as the basis for three mandatory advising sessions and the use of appreciative advising questions in weekly reflections and discussions.  All instructors are trained to use appreciative advising in their meetings with the students. After the appreciative approach was introduced, retention of SAS 100 students improved 18%. When control and treatment groups were compared, the treatment group achieved a statistically significant GPA gain of .73 (p=. 03) compared to the control group at .42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hutson, B.L. He, Y., Amundsen|title=Evaluating the impact of Appreciative Advising across higher education institutions: A multi-site evaluation (Poster Presentation at the annual meeting of the American Evaluation Association, Portland, OR.)|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal transfer advising ===
Appreciative advising is also particularly useful in internal transfer cases in which a student has realized that their current declared major may not be a good fit, but are struggling to identify a new major. Student Academic Services at UNCG has used appreciative advising to assist declared pre-nursing majors who have not met continuance requirements.  This began as a pilot program in the spring of 2005, and currently includes all pre-nursing majors who have a cumulative GPA that has been identified as not competitive by the School of Nursing.  The goal of the program is to help students explore their options, given that they are unlikely to be accepted into the School of Nursing.  Of the 145 students served by the program during the spring and fall semesters of 2005, 30% have changed their major, while an additional 43% continue to receive advising through Student Academic Services.  The mean GPA for participants has also improved dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutson|first=B.L|author2=Atwood, J.A.|title=Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First-year Experience Program ===
UNCG's [[First-Year Experience]] program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101), and uses a curriculum emphasizing appreciative advising. One stated aim of the program is to assist students in discovering their purposes, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with plans for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six appreciative advising stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program (Hutson &amp; Atwood, 2005). For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first semester GPA of 2.72.

'''Arts integration''' is an approach to teaching that integrates the fine and performing arts as primary pathways to learning. Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as "an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives."

==History of arts education and arts integration==
Arts integration is related to [[Arts in education|arts education]] in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of [[John Dewey]]'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's ''The Integrated School Art Program (1939).'' For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.

According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,'' Enlightened Cherishing''. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of [[cognition]]. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity—the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bresler | first1 = Liora | year = | title = The Subservient, Co-Equal, Affective, and Social Integration Styles and their Implications for.. | url = | journal = Arts Education Policy Review | volume = 96 | issue = 5| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bolyard Cassandra. (1973).

Formerly, [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include it as one of the Core Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html The Importance of Arts Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002052454/http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Please see Renaissance in the Classroom's sub-chapter entitled "The Arts in American Public Education: A Brief History" for a more comprehensive reading with additional references&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. 

==Arts integration research and advocacy==
Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches "21st-century skills" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education. Tension between the utilitarian, workplace-focused view and the educational, growth-centered framework on advocacy continues to shape and reshape the arts education universe as revisions to the&amp;nbsp;[http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/ National Core Arts Standards]&amp;nbsp;reflect fluctuations in advocacy rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Leann F.|date=2013|title=Questioning the Role of "21st-Century Skills" in Arts Education Advocacy Discourse|jstor=43288769|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.2307/43288769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key players ===
The impetus for the arts integration is a growing body of research that demonstrates how learners experience success when taught why and how to use music, visual art, drama/dance, theatre and the literary arts to both express and understand ideas, thoughts and feelings. Critical Links,&lt;ref&gt;Deasy, Richard, et al. Critical Links : Learning in the Arts and Student Academic and Social Development.

James Catterall, arts education researcher and professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has collaborated with CAPE on publications.

[[Harvard University]]'s Graduate School of Education supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120148/http://www.pzweb.harvard.edu/ Project Zero], an educational research group founded in 1967 by Nelson Goodman, which investigates learning in the arts. Former directors of Project Zero include David Perkins and [[Howard Gardner]]. Currently, it is directed by Steve Seidel, and has expanded its research in arts learning to include other branches of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm History of Project Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210538/http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] has been used as part of the rationale for the use of integrated arts models in teaching and learning.

For over 30 years, [http://www.kennedy-center.org the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts] in Washington, D.C., has been offering arts integration learning opportunities for educators.  Locally, through its [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/ Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)] program, the Kennedy Center provides professional learning for Washington, D.C. area educators that are implementing arts integration in their classrooms or teaching about an art form.  To develop a school-wide culture of arts integration, a network of CETA schools partner with the Kennedy Center to engage their teachers in in-depth professional learning focused on arts integration.  The CETA program has added to the research about the impact of arts integration on students, teachers, and school culture through multiple evaluation studies.  To reach educators throughout the nation, the Kennedy Center hosts an annual Arts Integration Conference, in which educators actively explore arts integration concepts and strategies.  The Kennedy Center’s online resource, [http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators.aspx ARTSEDGE], also hosts a web series of arts integration resources that explain the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of arts integration, provides examples of arts integration in practice, and links to a range of resources.  A series of Kennedy Center Seminars for Teaching Artists that focus on arts integration, as well as practices for developing strong arts-integrated residencies for students and workshops for teachers are available throughout the nation. A National Seminar for Teaching Artists is offered bi-annually at the Kennedy Center during the summer. 
Three other Kennedy Center national initiatives support practices and partnerships in arts integration and arts education: [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/anygivenchild/ Any Given Child], [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/ Partners in Education], and [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ VSA].

[[The Kennedy Center]] Partners in Education, headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], is an organization that has promoted arts integration for over two decades.

ArtsNow [http://www.artsnowlearning.org] provides professional development training for educators, focused on building the skills needed to integrate arts across the curriculum. Through the innovative Foundational Training course, teachers learn to identify opportunities to integrate all art forms - visual, dance, and music - into lessons in all class subjects for grades K-12, meeting both state and national curriculum standards (including Common Core standards). ArtsNow offers free Ignite Curriculum Guides through its website.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsNow Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

EducationCloset [http://educationcloset.com] provides professional development in arts integration and innovation in teaching.  With an annual Arts Integration conference, [https://educationcloset.com/integrated-curriculum/ Arts Integrated Curriculum], courses, webinars and publications available, teachers, artists, arts educators, administrators, and arts advocates can find rigorous, high-quality resources for Arts Integration which connect to Common Core State Standards and STEM.

With a focus on the classroom practice of arts integration, a nonprofit called Arts Integration Solutions (formerly the Opening Minds through the Arts Foundation) [http://www.artsintegration.com] provides professional development for teachers and program planning and implementation for schools and school districts. AiS has developed a set of tenets that are the basis for arts integration and a cycle that helps teachers develop daily lessons in math, science, reading and writing that use the arts to fully engage students. AiS has developed programming for use of arts integration in teaching the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and Literacy.

==Art education obstacles==
The three major skills in education that are considered the “core” subjects to teach students include math, writing, and reading comprehension. These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.

===No Child Left Behind===
The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04stud.html“Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools]. [[The New York Times]]. (2007). 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.

===School budgets===
While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, “On March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives”.&lt;ref&gt;"The FY11 Budget Deal: What Does It Mean For The Arts?." Electronic Musician 27.7 (2011): 13. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, “In 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida”.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Heather. "The Simple Facts." Teaching Artist Journal 2.3 (2004): 189. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.

Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.

===Practical uses===
Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, "Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;“What Does the NEAP Arts Assessment Measure?” National Center for Educational Statistics. 2009. 16 Nov, 2011. &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/whatmeasure.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today’s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today’s competitive job market.

===Arts integrated teachers===
An issue commonly brought is that “not all teachers are artists,” meaning that there aren’t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oreck |first=Barry |title=Artistic choices: A study of teachers who use the arts in the classroom |url=http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205121705/http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts |accessdate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittrich |last2=Pool |last3=Pool |first=Charles |first2=Jonelle |first3=Ken|title=Arts Integration in Teacher Preparation: Teaching the Teachers|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985616.pdf|publisher=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.

Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.

==The contribution of arts education to children’s development==
The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation. In a society where the entire educational system is based on preparing a future work force, focus is put on the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts are neglected. In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children’s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education. Research shows that children exposed to arts do better in school, develop greater social, cognitive and emotional skills and are more likely to earn higher degrees of education later in life.

===Academic effects===
Participation in arts programs is positively correlated with increased academic achievement, including higher math and verbal SAT scores, when compared to the performance of students without arts education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (2011). Reinvesting in arts education: Winning America’s future through creative schools. http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/PCAH_Reinvesting_4web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS;88), a panel study which has followed more than 25,000 students in American secondary schools for 10 years, show significant results on the positive outcomes from children exposed to high arts in school with a teacher supervising. The study examines the time from 8th grade through 10th and 12th grade and throughout high school. Furthermore, this study, conducted by James Catterall and colleagues, which started in the mid-90s followed up on the same students at age 26 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, J. S. (2009). Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art: The Effects of Education in the Visual and Performing Arts on the Achievements and Values of Young Adults. Los Angeles/London: Imagination Group/I‐Group Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exploratory study published by the [[National Art Education Association]] looked at the integration of arts in classroom curriculum and concluded that this integration enhanced academic learning because of the fully immersive engagement of the arts, which allows students to understand different perspectives, safely take risks, express feelings through less restrictive modes, and draw parallels between the arts and traditional core subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Patricia|date=2007|title=Making Meaning Many Ways: An Exploratory Look at Integrating the Arts with Classroom Curriculum|jstor=27696226|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=4|pages=33–38|doi=10.2307/27696226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-emotional development===
A significant consensus among research on arts education exists and this is that arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, E. B. (1999). Champions of Change - The Impact of the Arts on Learning. Washington, D.C.: The Arts Education Partnership &amp; The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Students failing is commonly explained by disengaged students and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;Achbacher, P. &amp;. (1991). The Humanitas Program evaluation, 1990-91. Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers.  Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance. The confidence, collaboration, and creativity that arts education fosters has a circular, positive effect on academics as well as cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural development===
Positive outcomes by means of socio-cultural development, through exposure to minorities and different cultures, is a contribution of arts education aiming at breaking stereotypes and developing teamwork skills, tolerance and appreciation of diversity. One study, collected by the Association for the Advancement of Arts Education (AAAE), on students’ exposure to Native American music using an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the teaching of instrumental music and bringing in guest artists, showed decreased stereotypical attitudes and greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. These changes were measured by the American Indian Belief Inventory was measured on four groups exposed to Native American culture and a fifth group with no cultural exposure. All of the four groups showed improvement while the fifth control group did not.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, K. (1994). North American Indian Music Instruction : Influences upon attitudes, cultural perceptions, and achievement.D.M.A. dissertation. Tempa, Arizona.: Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies have shown that students with arts education are more civically engaged. This socio-cultural effect of arts integration is disproportionately stronger for at-risk students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Catterall, James|date=March 2012|title=The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth: Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies. Research Report #55.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530822|journal=National Endowment for the Arts|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
Research on the contribution of the arts to the cognitive field show a great array of cognitive developments in spatial-temporal abilities, verbal skills, memory and spatial reasoning.
A study by Chan ''et al.'' using sixty female college students in the U.S showed a relationship of the students’ music training before age 12 and their verbal memory. The students with music training showed a significantly better recall than those without formal training. 
A meta-analysis by the American Psychological Association furthermore showed how listening to music can result in progressive relaxation and that listening to classical music one hour a day increases greater brain coherence and more time spent in the alpha state (state of aware relaxation stimulating imagination, intuition and higher awareness).&lt;ref&gt;Malyarenko. (1996). Music Alters Children's Brainwaves, Human Physiology, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on premature babies have also found that while receiving special care and being exposed to classical music they physically and mentally developed significantly faster than those babies who weren’t exposed to classical music.  Further studies have also indicated that incorporating Art into academic education for disabled children better supported cognitive development and improved communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Rawley A.

== Integration of arts in classroom curriculum ==
Jessica Davis presents eight different frameworks for considering the role of the arts in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jessica Hoffman|date=1999-05-01|title=Nowhere, Somewhere, Everywhere: The Arts in Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10632919909599472|journal=Arts Education Policy Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=23–28|doi=10.1080/10632919909599472|issn=1063-2913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gullatt|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Enhancing Student Learning through Arts Integration: Implications for the Profession|jstor=40364094|journal=The High School Journal|volume=91|issue=4|pages=12–25|doi=10.1353/hsj.0.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her categories and methods are as follows:
# ''Arts-Based -'' Art is at the core of learning, providing a lens through which students can understand other subjects. Art serves as the basic threshold for general learning.
# ''Arts-Injected (or Infused) -'' Art is "injected" from the outside as a matter of enrichment (e.g., a period of music, visiting artists, etc.)
# ''Arts-Included'' - Art is offered alongside traditional curriculum, not necessarily for interdisciplinary purposes but rather as its own course of study.
# ''Arts-Expansion'' - Art is an exploratory adventure that takes students outside of school (e.g., field trips to a museum, concert hall, etc.)
# ''Arts-Professional'' - This approach treats art training as a means for a professional career in the arts, and turning students into artists is the primary goal.
# ''Arts-Extras'' - Art is sometimes offered as an additional commitment outside of regular school curriculum (e.g., school newspaper, after-school dance clubs, etc.).
# ''Arts-Education -'' Referred to by some as aesthetic education, this approach uses art as a way of knowing, turning its study more philosophical to interpret and apply to experiences.
# ''Arts-Cultura'' - Art connects individual students' "culture" to collective community "cultures" to more structured racial/national "Cultures" to the ultimate universal "Culture." It is through this interplay that art encourages students to take risks, think critically, and make meaning.
It is often difficult to fully integrate the arts with traditional classroom instruction in a way that allows for the arts-cultura model. This is largely due to the disconnect between art teachers and teachers of other subjects, who are not given the time or ability to coordinate and interweave lesson plans that apply art to core subjects and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arts Technology Integration ===
As technology continually advances, arts integration evolves to match. The challenge in integrating arts in today's technology-first education lies not in implementing production labs on school campuses or accessing the latest computer software, but rather in effectively managing the sheer amount of information that technology makes available. Students must learn to select relevant data, assess these data, and draw critically from them in order to make meaning, answer questions, or form new ones. Technology also presents more channels of expression, whether through digital art or artificial intelligence, which, if supported by arts-technology integration, can cultivate the experimentation and inquiry that arts education champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Sherry|date=2007|title=Implications for Art Education in the Third Millennium: Art Technology Integration|jstor=27696216|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=3|pages=45–51|doi=10.2307/27696216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a special agency of the UN that operates from Paris, France, advocates the need for the integration of arts, culture, and creativity in all educational platforms worldwide. This agenda is in line with the structure of “Quality Education” and “Education for All” to support methodologies for promoting and protecting diversity of cultural manifestation. For example, UNESCO Bangkok took the initiative of upholding research activities related to Arts Education and swap of information along with case studies among educators, artists, and other stakeholders within Asia and the Pacific. The very first international congress on arts education was held in Seoul (Korea) in 2006 and the second in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bangkok.unesco.org/content/releasing-power-arts-%E2%80%93-exploring-arts-education-asia-pacific|title=Releasing the Power of the Arts – Exploring Arts Education in the Asia-Pacific|work=UNESCO Bangkok|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Due to current economic recession many schools across see their arts programs cut off in favor of core curriculum subject such as English, math and science. Despite the lack of apparent and secure job possibilities within the arts and a pressuring need for a strong work force within the [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) research show that arts education is crucial in children’s learning process and development. In 2013 a congressional resolution sought to include "A" for Art in the STEM acronym, changing it to STEAM.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf |title=H. RES. 51 House of Representatives Joint Resolution|year=2012 |author= |publisher=113th Congress, 2013–2015|accessdate=2013-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that children exposed to arts education throughout childhood through primary, secondary and tertiary school show greater scores on academic achievements as well as greater social, cultural, emotional and cognitive development. Some of the measured improvement are greater self-confidence, communicative skills, cultural awareness and sensitivity alongside greater stimulated creativity and overall academic achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''CSCOPE''' is a [[K-12]] [[Curriculum|educational curriculum]] support system that has been widely adopted in [[Texas]]. It was created by the Texas Education Service Center Curriculum Collaborative (TESCCC).

==Use==

Nineteen out of twenty education regions in Texas have districts that use CSCOPE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gulick |first=Joe |url=http://lubbockonline.com/education/2010-08-15/new-curriculum-system-cscope-bring-big-changes-schools-lubbock-across-state |title=New curriculum system CSCOPE to bring big changes to schools in Lubbock, across state &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of January 2, 2011 there were 747 [[school district]]s (out of 1,051 total) using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/01/02/2739194/school-districts-adopting-cscope.html |title=School districts adopting CSCOPE online curriculum &amp;#124; Mom2MomDFW.com |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2011-01-03 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

While popular with district administrators, CSCOPE has elicited mixed reactions from teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=84597 |title=Texas Teachers ~ Do you use C-Scope? - ProTeacher Community |publisher=Proteacher.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom feel excessively constrained by a set [[School timetable|timetable]] for lessons.  Other teachers, however, feel that CSCOPE is appreciated by the students and has improved classroom performance and attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Roger |url=http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927 |title=News &amp; Photos - The Llano News - Llano, Texas |publisher=The Llano News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312034723/http://www.llanonews.com/news/article/28927# |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that CSCOPE will better help prepare districts for the next generation of [[standardized test]]s in Texas, such as the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7874 |title=Texas Education Agency - STAAR debuts |publisher=Tea.state.tx.us |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is a product of an increased emphasis on [[accountability]] in [[State school|public education]] over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Work |first=Ann |url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/news/2010/mar/26/local-schools-planning-for-new-cscope-curriculum/ |title=Local schools planning for new CSCOPE curriculum |publisher=Times Record News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upcoming changes==
In 2013, after complaints about parents' inability to access the curriculum as well as about lesson plans, Texas announced significant changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/cypresscreek/news/sen-patrick-cscope-announce-sweeping-changes/article_dfb36eaa-7216-11e2-9245-0019bb2963f4.html |title=
Sen. Patrick, CSCOPE announce sweeping changes  |publisher=Cyprus Creek Mirror |date=Feb 8, 2013 |accessdate=Feb 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be made to the system. These changes include:

* Making all meetings of the governing board public, and meeting all the respective [[notice]] requirements.
* A joint review process of all CSCOPE lessons, beginning with [[Social studies|Social Studies]].
* Removing civil or criminal penalties associated with the release of CSCOPE content.
* Allowing teachers to post any and all CSCOPE lessons that they deem necessary.
* Creating a standing curriculum review panel composed of parents, teachers, and school administrators.

[[Image:Spicker trinkflasche.jpg|thumb|Cheat sheet in a [[juicebox (container)|juice box]]]]
A '''cheat sheet''' (also ''cheatsheet'') or '''crib sheet''' is a concise set of notes used for quick reference.

Cheat sheets are so named because they may be used by students without the instructor's knowledge to [[Cheating|cheat]] on a [[Test (assessment)|test]]. However, at higher levels of education where [[rote learning|rote memorization]] is not as important as in basic education, students may be permitted to consult their own notes during the exam (which is not considered cheating).  The act of preparing a crib sheet can be an educational exercise, and students are sometimes only allowed to use crib sheets they have written themselves. 

A cheat sheet is a physical piece of paper, often filled with equations and/or facts in compressed writing. Students often print cheat sheets in extremely small font, fitting an entire page of notes in the palm of their hands during the exam.

Crib sheets are also fully worked solutions for exams or work sheets normally handed out to university staff in order to ease marking.

==As reference cards==
{{Main|Reference card}}
In more general usage, a crib sheet is any short (one or two page) reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them.  Many computer applications, for example, have crib sheets included in their documentation, which list keystrokes or menu commands needed to achieve specific tasks to save the user the effort of digging through an entire manual to find the keystroke needed to, for example, move between two windows.  An example of such a crib sheet is one for the [[GIMP]] photo editing software.&lt;ref name="Keys and Mouse Reference"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.gimp.org/en/key-reference.html |title=GIMP Keys and Mouse Reference |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include "Read Me First" and "Quick Reference Card" documents included with consumer electronics.

Some academic and technical publishers also publish crib sheets for software packages and technical topics.  In some cases these are also intended as display items in that they are colorful and visually appealing. Web-based crib sheets, such as references to terms, commands, or symbols, have become extremely common.

As of 10th July 2018, [https://codesignal.com/ CodeFights] has been renamed to [https://codesignal.com/ CodeSignal] with additional features as per the company blog.

== History ==
CodeSignal was founded in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#7e22446c7912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-site-helps-outsiders-land-tech-jobs-1479232236|title=New Site Helps Outsiders Land Tech Jobs|last=Simons|first=John|date=2016-11-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Tigran Sloyan, Aram Shatakhtsyan, and Felix Desroches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2c631d487912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for CodeSignal was developed from Sloyan and Shatakhtsyan’s experiences of participating in international coding and mathematics competitions including the International Olympiad in Informatics and Mathematics. Sloyan even used this concept of a game-based teaching platform for his Computer Science master’s thesis at MIT, but abandoned the idea to work in established Silicon Valley companies including Oracle, Google, and Premise (backed by Google Ventures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/premise|title=Premise Data {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal first launched with challenges only for JavaScript and were based on “code battles”, a 3-minute person versus person competition to determine who can more quickly and accurately debug existing code.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before each game, players can either choose to race against the clock, or let CodeSignal automatically match them with other online players to complete the challenge head-to-head. Successful challengers level up and earn badges towards language fluency. Even though players are first presented with short challenges that take only a few minutes to solve, each challenge increases in difficulty and the amount of time given to solve the problem.

Soon, CodeSignal expanded to support Java, C++ and Python challenges. Today, CodeSignal supports 38 programming languages and has also expanded to include more types of challenges, interview practice, and access to companies with open software engineering positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/806782/a-startup-is-gaming-bias-in-tech-recruitment-by-organizing-coding-matches/|title=CodeFights aims to remove hiring bias in Silicon Valley with Code Arcade and competitions against coding bots — Quartz|last=Bhattacharya|first=Ananya|website=qz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though CodeSignal launched as a platform to help users learn and improve their coding skills, CodeSignal has also taken on changing recruiting all together. CodeFight’s main goal is to help programmers get hired based on their skills, not their resume.

== CodeSignal for Developers ==
CodeSignal originally launched as an online community where developers can practice their skills through a series of Head-to-Head coding challenges,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/startups-are-making-the-rejection-letter-a-thing-of-the-past/|title=Startups are making the rejection letter a thing of the past – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appealed to competitive programmers.&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal was to help developers build their coding skills by solving and discussing programming challenges with other developers on the platform.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3057218/you-might-apply-for-your-next-job-by-playing-a-mobile-game|title=You Might Apply For Your Next Job By Playing A Mobile Game|date=2016-02-29|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 2 years, the CodeSignal platform had 6 distinct game modes: Interview Practice, Company Bots, Arcade, Tournaments, Head-to-Head, and Challenges; all geared towards helping developers build skills and getting prepared for technical real-world jobs. In all of these modes, the CodeSignal system runs a user’s solution to a coding challenge against tests, and the solution is only accepted when all test cases are satisfied.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; All CodeFight modes for developers are free of charge.

As of August 2017, CodeSignal has reported that it had nearly 1 million developers using CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Interview Practice ===
Interview Practice is the newest and most popular mode on CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/codefights-new-practice-mode-helps-developers-prepare-for-job-interviews/|title=CodeFights launches a new practice mode to help developers prepare for job interviews – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode first launched in beta in February 2017, and then launched the expanded the version in June 2017.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt; The Interview Practice game mode is specifically targeted towards job seekers who are preparing for engineering technical interviews. Developers can use Interview Practice to solve real interview questions, master key computer science topics, and learn by reviewing solutions provided within the community.

=== Company Bots ===
Launched in November 2015, Company Bots&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; are curated challenges that simulate real-world problems that companies are facing. This type of assessment is based on the premise that solving on-the-job coding challenges can allow companies to better assess the skills of a potential candidate.

During a Company Bot challenge, participants are faced with multiple rounds of challenges of varying difficulty. Both the bot and the challenger are attempting to solve the coding challenge side by side. Each participant gains points based on speed and accuracy. After the participant submits their solution, it is evaluated and only accepted if it passes all the tests. Only after winning the Bot challenge, can the participant be provided with the opportunity to submit their information to the recruiter of the company running the Company Bot challenge.

CodeSignal launched Company Bots with a partnership with [[Uber]] to create Uberbot, a Uber-branded gaming challenge&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/05/uber-teams-with-codefights-to-create-uberbot-a-game-to-test-coding-skills-of-potential-hires/|title=Uber teams with CodeFights to create UberBot, a game to test coding skills of potential hires|date=2015-11-05|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; on CodeSignal that would help Uber find and evaluate the programming skills of candidates. Candidates who attempted the Uberbot coding game are challenged to solve real-world problems facing Uber’s engineering team, such as finding the most optimal route for a Uber ride, or the most efficient method of matching riders for an [[uberPOOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eng.uber.com/uberbot/|title=Building the #UberBot on CodeFights for Uber Engineering {{!}} Uber Engineering Blog|date=2015-10-20|work=Uber Engineering Blog|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal now has 15 company bots including bots from [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Quora]],&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt; [[Instacart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/from-under-the-rug/how-competing-against-a-bot-could-land-you-a-developer-job.html|title=How Competing Against a ‘Bot’ Could Land You a Developer Job|website=www.itbusinessedge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SpaceX]], [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-has-a-new-service-to-help-companies-find-job-candidates-2017-10|title=This startup wants to help programmers get hired based on their coding skills rather than their résumés|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CodeSignal for Recruiters ==
In addition to being a learning tool for developers, CodeSignal Recruiter (previously known as CodeSignalR)  is also a skills-based recruiting platform that uses a data-driven approach to help companies improve their hiring process, find better qualified candidates, and make more objective hiring decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2a36b1967912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;

Launched in October 2017, CodeSignal Recruiter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-codefightsr-to-deliver-data-driven-skills-based-recruiting-300543663.html|title=CodeFights Launches CodeFightsR To Deliver Data-Driven Skills-Based Recruiting|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the sourcing, testing, and interview platform for technical recruiters. Companies with a CodeSignal Recruiter account can contact developers within the CodeSignal community who have done well on challenges &lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; and have signalled that they are open to new jobs. Once contacted, recruiters can use CodeSignal to send out custom programming tests to candidates that include plagiarism checks, live recordings, timed assessments, all within a developer-focused IDE (integrated development environment).

CodeSignal Recruiter is also integrated with Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software including Greenhouse, Lever and SmartRecruiters, which allows recruiters to manage and sync candidate data between CodeSignal and their recruiting platform including send coding tests, evaluating results and managing candidate lifecycles.

Some of CodeFight’s Recruiter customers include [[Evernote]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/16/the-hiring-game/|title=The hiring game – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uber]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Ascend Communications|Ascend]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/codefights-customer-stories-ascend-io/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Ascend.io {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-23|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.wizeline.com/ Wizeline]&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/customer-stories-wizeline/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Wizeline {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-08|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quora]].&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt;

=== CodeSignal Coding Score ===
CodeSignal launched their rating system, called Coding Score, on July 10, 2018. The Coding Score is a measure of a developer's overall implementation and problem-solving ability. It is a predictor of how well a developer will perform in technical interviews. To get a initial Coding Score on CodeSignal, each developer has to solve at least 3 tasks on CodeSignal. To get a more accurate score, developers are asked to vary the difficulty of the tasks that they solve.

=== Testing&lt;ref name="The New Stack"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewstack.io/helping-engineers-assess-their-skills/|title=CodeFights: A Platform to Test Coding Skills, Prepare for Interviews and Apply for Jobs - The New Stack|date=2017-05-09|work=The New Stack|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
CodeSignal Recruiter also has a testing feature that allows recruiters to send out technical assessments to their potential candidates. These tests can be customized to simulate real-world challenges that the candidate may face on the job, which has been reported to be a better measurement for competency than regular interview questions or theoretical programming tests. The testing suite also has a built in plagiarism checker that predicts the probability of plagiarism by comparing to other completed tests on the CodeSignal platform and solutions from known sites. During the on-boarding process CodeSignal works with customers to create custom tests so the online tests are calibrated with the interview process and job responsibilities.&lt;ref name="The New Stack"/&gt;

=== Interviewing ===
The CodeSignal Recruiter Interview feature allows recruiters to conduct online and in-person interviews in a shared coding environment that supports 38 programming languages. The interview environment allows for timed assessments, live recordings, and an extensive library of skills-based coding tasks. During each live interview, the hiring manager can watch and conduct a coding skills assessment using pre-defined coding tasks while also talking to the candidate over a live video stream. Each live interview is also recorded so that other hiring managers in the recruitment process can review and share the candidates live assessment.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-interview-practice-to-help-coders-ace-technical-job-interviews-at-top-tech-companies-300407220.html|title=CodeFights Launches Interview Practice To Help Coders Ace Technical Job Interviews At Top Tech Companies|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
As of July 2017, CodeSignal has raised a total of $12.5 million in 2 rounds from 23 investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/codefights#/entity|title=CodeFights {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised an initial $2.5 million in seed funding in April 2015,&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/codefights-raises-10m-series-a-round-for-its-skills-based-recruiting-platform/|title=CodeFights raises $10M Series A round for its skills-based recruiting platform – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included investments by Felicis Ventures (Aydin Senkut), Sutter Hill Ventures (Mike Speiser), LiveRamp CEO Auren Hoffman, Google Shopping Express founder Tom Fallows, Twitter VP of Engineering Raffi Krikorian, [[Quora]] CEO [[Adam D'Angelo]] and [[GoDaddy]] VP of Engineering Marek Olszewski.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; CodeSignal raised $10 million in November 2016. The Series A funding round was led by [[e.ventures]]. Other investors in that round included SV Angel, A Capital, Granatus Ventures,&lt;ref name="Simons20162"&gt;Simons, John.

== Reception ==
Within the first 6 months of its launch, CodeSignal featured over 1,500 challenges,&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/codefights-scores-2-4-million-to-turn-coding-practice-into-a-game/|title=CodeFights Scores $2.4 Million To Turn Coding Practice Into A Game – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted over 70,000 users who solve over 1.5 million challenges. From there, CodeSignal was reported to grow by 30-40% month-over-month.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

As of August 2017, CodeSignal has reported that it had nearly 1 million developers using CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Languages Supported==
CodeSignal supports 38 different coding languages on its platform. However, not all tasks on the site can be solved using every language, based on the challenge type.&lt;ref&gt;The CodeFights Team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Cognitive strategies''' are the specific methods that people use to [[Problem solving|solve problems]], including all sorts of reasoning, planning, arithmetic, etc. Importantly, a cognitive strategy need not be all "in the head", but will almost always interact with various aspects of what might be called the "execution context".

==Examples==

A commonly used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by which one can get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a "memory" strategy), but a toddler would probably use one of a number of different finger-counting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R.S., &amp; Shipley, C. (1995). Variation, selection, and cognitive change. In T. Simon &amp; G. Halford (Eds.), Developing cognitive competence: New approaches to process modeling (pp. 31–76). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can represent the first addend (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67550">'''Computer-supported collaborative learning''' ('''CSCL''') is a [[pedagogical]] approach where in learning takes place via social interaction using a computer or through the Internet. This kind of learning is characterized by the sharing and [[learning|construction of knowledge]] among participants using technology as their primary means of communication or as a common resource.&lt;ref name="stahl"&gt;Stahl, G., Koschmann, T., &amp; Suthers, D. (2006). Computer-supported collaborative learning: An historical perspective. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), [http://gerrystahl.net/cscl/CSCL_English.pdf Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences] (pp. 409-426). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  CSCL can be implemented in online and classroom learning environments and can take place synchronously or asynchronously.

The study of computer-supported collaborative learning draws on a number of academic disciplines, including [[instructional technology]], [[educational psychology]], [[sociology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[social psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hmelo-Silver, C.E. (2006). Analyzing collaborative learning: Multiple approaches to understanding processes and outcomes. Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Learning sciences, USA, 1059-1065. {{ISBN|0-8058-6174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[collaborative learning]] and [[computer-supported cooperative work|computer supported cooperative work (CSCW)]].

==History==
Interactive computing technology was primarily conceived by academics, but the use of technology in education has historically been defined by contemporary research trends. The earliest instances of software in instruction drilled students using the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] method that was popular throughout the mid-twentieth century. In the 1970s as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] gained traction with educators, designers began to envision learning technology that employed artificial intelligence models that could adapt to individual learners.&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T. (1996) CSCL: Theory and practice of an emerging paradigm Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-supported collaborative learning emerged as a strategy rich with research implications for the growing philosophies of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and [[social cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="resta"&gt;Resta, P. &amp; Laferrière, T. (2007). Technology in Support of Collaborative Learning. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 19, 65–83. {{doi|10.1007/s10648-007-9042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though studies in collaborative learning and technology took place throughout the 1980s and 90s, the earliest public workshop directly addressing CSCL was "Joint Problem Solving and [[Microcomputers]]" which took place in [[San Diego]] in 1983. Six years later in 1989, the term "computer-supported collaborative learning" was used in a [[NATO]]-sponsored workshop in [[Maratea]], Italy.&lt;ref name="stahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bannon"&gt;Bannon, Liam J. (1989). [http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html Issues in computer supported collaborative learning.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126144330/http://www.ul.ie/~idc/library/papersreports/LiamBannon/12/LBMarat.html |date=2011-01-26 }} Chapter to appear in Proceedings of NATO Advanced Workshop on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (Claire O'Malley, Editor) held in Maratea, Italy, Sept. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; A biannual CSCL conference series began in 1995. At the 2002 and 2003 CSCL conferences, the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) was established to run the CSCL and ICLS conference series and the ''International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning'' (''ijCSCL'') and JLS journals.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for the Learning Sciences. (2010). [http://www.isls.org/conferences.html Conferences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061618/http://www.isls.org/conferences.html |date=2011-05-25 }}. Retrieved 10/20/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ijCSCL'' was established by the CSCL research community and ISLS. It began quarterly publication by Springer in 2006. It is peer reviewed and published both online and in print. Since 2009, it has been rated by ISI as being in the top 10% of educational research journals based on its impact factor.&lt;ref&gt;ijCSCL [http://ijCSCL.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid development of social media technologies and the increasing need of individuals to understand and use those technologies has brought researchers from many disciplines to the field of CSCL.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt; CSCL is used today in traditional and online schools and knowledge-building communities such as [[Wikipedia]].

==Theories==
The field of CSCL draws heavily from a number of learning theories that emphasize that knowledge is the result of learners interacting with each other, sharing knowledge, and building knowledge as a group.  Since the field focuses on collaborative activity and collaborative learning, it inherently takes much from constructivist and social cognitivist learning theories.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Precursor theories===
The roots of collaborative epistemology as related to CSCL can be found in [[Vygotsky]]'s social learning theory. Of particular importance to CSCL is the theory's notion of internalization, or the idea that knowledge is developed by one's interaction with one's surrounding culture and society.  The second key element is what Vygotsky called the [[Zone of proximal development]]. This refers to a range of tasks that can be too difficult for a learner to master by themselves but is made possible with the assistance of a more skilled individual or teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Kearsley, G. (13 Oct 10). [http://icebreakerideas.com/learning-theories/ The Theory Into Practice Database].&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas feed into a notion central to CSCL: knowledge building is achieved through interaction with others.

[[Cooperative learning]], though different in some ways from collaborative learning, also contributes to the success of teams in CSCL environments. The distinction can be stated as: cooperative learning focuses on the effects of group interaction on individual learning whereas collaborative learning is more concerned with the cognitive processes at the group unit of analysis such as shared meaning making and the joint problem space. The five elements for effective cooperative groups identified by the work of Johnson and Johnson are positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, [[social skills]], and group processing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., &amp; Holubec, E. (2002). Circles of learning: Cooperation in the classroom. Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company, p. 95-118, {{ISBN|0-939603-12-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inherent relationship between cooperation and collaboration, understanding what encourages successful cooperation is essential to CSCL research.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter wrote seminal articles leading to the development of key CSCL concepts: knowledge-building communities and knowledge-building discourse, intentional learning, and expert processes. Their work led to an early collaboration-enabling technology known as the Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE).&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia, M. &amp; Bereiter, C. (1994). Computer support for knowledge building communities. The Journal of the Learning Sciences. 3(3), 265-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically for CSCL, their theories were integrated with the design, deployment, and study of the CSCL technology. CSILE later became Knowledge Forum, which is the most widely used CSCL technology worldwide to date.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Other learning theories that provide a foundation for CSCL include [[distributed cognition]], [[problem-based learning]], [[group cognition]], cognitive apprenticeship, and situated learning.  Each of these learning theories focuses on the social aspect of learning and knowledge building, and recognizes that learning and knowledge building involve inter-personal activities including conversation, argument, and negotiation.&lt;ref name="resta" /&gt;

===Collaboration theory and [[group cognition]]===
Only in the last 15 to 20 years have researchers begun to explore the extent to which computer technology could enhance the collaborative learning process.  While researchers, in general, have relied on learning theories developed without consideration of computer-support, some have suggested that the field needs to have a theory tailored and refined for the unique challenges that confront those trying to understand the complex interplay of technology and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="collab"&gt;Stahl, G. (2002). Contributions to a theoretical framework for CSCL. In G. Stahl (Ed.), Computer support for collaborative learning: Foundations for a CSCL community. Proceedings of CSCL 2002 (pp. 62-71). Boulder, CO: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaboration theory, suggested as a system of analysis for CSCL by [[Gerry Stahl]] in 2002-2006, postulates that knowledge is constructed in social interactions such as discourse. The theory suggests that learning is not a matter of accepting fixed facts, but is the dynamic, on-going, and evolving result of complex interactions primarily taking place within communities of people. It also emphasizes that collaborative learning is a process of constructing meaning and that meaning creation most often takes place and can be observed at the group unit of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. (2004). [http://GerryStahl.net/cscl/papers/ch16.pdf Building collaborative knowing: Elements of a social theory of CSCL.] In J.-W. Strijbos, P. Kirschner &amp; R. Martens (Eds.), What we know about CSCL: And implementing it in higher education (pp. 53-86). Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of collaboration theory is to develop an understanding of how meaning is collaboratively constructed, preserved, and re-learned through the media of language and artifacts in group interaction. There are four crucial themes in collaboration theory: collaborative knowledge building (which is seen as a more concrete term than "learning"); group and personal perspectives intertwining to create group understanding; mediation by artifacts (or the use of resources which learners can share or imprint meaning on); and interaction analysis using captured examples that can be analyzed as proof that the knowledge building occurred.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Collaboration theory proposes that technology in support of CSCL should provide new types of media that foster the building of collaborative knowing; facilitate the comparison of knowledge built by different types and sizes of groups; and help collaborative groups with the act of negotiating the knowledge they are building. Further, these technologies and designs should strive to remove the teacher as the bottleneck in the communication process.  In other words, the teacher should not have to act as the conduit for communication between students or as the avenue by which information is dispensed.  Finally, collaboration theory-influenced technologies will strive to increase the quantity and quality of learning moments via computer-simulated situations.&lt;ref name="collab" /&gt;

Stahl extended his proposals about collaboration theory during the next decade with his research on [[group cognition]] [http://GerryStahl.net/elibrary]. In his book on "Group Cognition",&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;Stahl, G. (2006). Group Cognition: Computer support for building collaborative knowledge. Cambridge:MA. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he provided a number of case studies of prototypes of collaboration technology, as well as a sample in-depth interaction analysis and several essays on theoretical issues related to re-conceptualizing cognition at the small-group unit of analysis. He then launched the [[Virtual Math Teams]] project at the Math Forum, which conducted more than 10 years of studies of students exploring mathematical topics collaboratively online. "Studying VMT"&lt;ref name="SVMT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2009). Studying Virtual Math Teams. New York:NY. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; documented many issues of design, analysis and theory related to this project. The VMT later focused on supporting dynamic geometry by integrating a multi-user version of GeoGebra. All aspects of this phase of the VMT project were described in "Translating Euclid."&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;Stahl, G. (2013). Translating Euclid: Creating a Human-Centered Mathematics. Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, "Constructing Dynamic Triangles Together"&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Stahl, G. (2016). Constructing dynamic triangles together: The development of mathematical group cognition. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a detailed analysis of how a group of four girls learned about dynamic geometry by enacting a series of group practices during an eight-session longitudinal case study. The VMT project generated and analyzed data at the small-group unit of analysis, to substantiate and refine the theory of group cognition and to offer a model of design-based CSCL research.

==Strategies==
Currently, CSCL is used in instructional plans in classrooms both traditional and online from primary school to post-graduate institutions. Like any other instructional activity, it has its own prescribed practices and strategies which educators are encouraged to employ in order to use it effectively. Because its use is so widespread, there are innumerable scenarios in the use of CSCL, but there are several common strategies that provide a foundation for group cognition.

One of the most common approaches to CSCL is [[collaborative writing]]. Though the final product can be anything from a research paper, a Wikipedia entry, or a short story, the process of planning and writing together encourages students to express their ideas and develop a group understanding of the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Heimbuch, S., &amp; Bodemer, D. (2015). Let's Talk about Talks: Supporting Knowledge Exchange Processes on Wiki Discussion Pages. In ''AAAI Technical Report on Wikipedia, a Social Pedia: Research Challenges and Opportunities (ICWSM-15)'' (Vol. WS-15-19), 56–61. Palo Alto, USA: AAAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tools like [[blogs]], [[interactive whiteboards]], and custom spaces that combine free writing with communication tools can be used to share work, form ideas, and write synchronously.&lt;ref&gt;Onrubia, J. &amp; Engel, A. (2009). Strategies for Collaborative Writing and Phases of Knowledge Construction in CSCL Environments. Computers &amp; Education, 53(4), 1256-1265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikis"&gt;Larusson, J., &amp; Alterman, R. (2009). Wikis to support the "collaborative" part of collaborative learning. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(4), 371-402. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-009-9076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology-mediated discourse refers to debates, discussions, and other social learning techniques involving the examination of a theme using technology. For example, wikis are a way to encourage discussion among learners, but other common tools include mind maps, survey systems, and simple message boards. Like collaborative writing, technology-mediated discourse allows participants that may be separated by time and distance to engage in conversations and build knowledge together.&lt;ref name="wikis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asterhan, C., &amp; Schwarz, B. (2010). Online moderation of synchronous e-argumentation. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 259-82. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exploration refers to the shared discovery of a place, activity, environment or topic among two or more people. Students do their exploring in an online environment, use technology to better understand a physical area, or reflect on their experiences together through the Internet. [[Virtual worlds]] like [[Second Life]] and [[Whyville]] as well as synchronous communication tools like [[Skype]] may be used for this kind of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, B., &amp; Ketelhut, D. (2008). Exploring embedded guidance and self-efficacy in educational multi-user virtual environments. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(4), 413-27. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioannidou, A., Repenning, A., Webb, D., Keyser, D., Luhn, L., &amp; Daetwyler, C. (2010). Mr. Vetro: A Collective Simulation for teaching health science. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(2), 141-66. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9082-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem-based learning is a popular instructional activity that lends itself well to CSCL because of the social implications of problem solving. Complex problems call for rich group interplay that encourages collaboration and creates movement toward a clear goal.&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;Lu, J., Lajoie, S., &amp; Wiseman, J. (2010). Scaffolding problem-based learning with CSCL tools. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 5(3), 283-98. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-010-9092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koschmann, T., Feltovich, P., Myers, A., &amp; Barrows, H. (1992). Implications of CSCL for problem-based learning:Special issue on computer supported collaborative learning. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(3), 32-35. {{doi|10.1145/130893.130902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project-based learning]] is similar to problem-based learning in that it creates impetus to establish team roles and set goals. The need for collaboration is also essential for any project and encourages team members to build experience and knowledge together. Although there are many advantages to using software that has been specifically developed to support collaborative learning or project-based learning in a particular domain, any  file sharing or communication tools can be used to facilitate CSCL in problem- or project-based environments.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld, P., Soloway, E., Marx, R., Krajcik, J., Guzdial, M., &amp; Palincsar, A. (1991). Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning. Educational Psychologist, 26(3/4), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Web 2.0]] applications  (wikies,  blogs,  RSS  feed,  collaborative  writing,  video  sharing,  social  networks, etc.) are used for computer-supported collaborative learning specific strategies should be used for their implementation, especially regarding (1) adoption by teachers and students; (2) usability and quality in use issues; (3) technology maintenance; (4) pedagogy and instructional design; (5) social interaction between students; (6) privacy issues; and (7) information/system security.&lt;ref&gt;Bubas, G., Orehovacki, T., Coric, A. (2011). Strategies for implementation of Web 2.0 tools in academic education [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307915719_Strategies_for_implementation_of_Web_20_tools_in_academic_education]. 17th European University Information Systems International Congress, EUNIS 2011, Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teacher roles==

Though the focus in CSCL is on individuals collaborating with their peers, teachers still have a vital role in facilitating learning. Most obviously, the instructor must introduce the CSCL activity in a thoughtful way that contributes to an overarching design plan for the course. The design should clearly define the learning outcomes and [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessments]] for the activity. In order to assure that learners are aware of these objectives and that they are eventually met, proper administration of both resources and expectations is necessary to avoid learner overload. Once the activity has begun, the teacher is charged with kick-starting and monitoring discussion to facilitate learning. He or she must also be able to mitigate technical issues for the class. Lastly, the instructor must engage in [[Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning|assessment]], in whatever form the design calls for, in order to ensure objectives have been met for all students.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, P (2008). [http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf Competencies for online instructors.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703164002/http://www.learningpeaks.com/instrcomp.pdf |date=2008-07-03 }} Learning Peaks, Retrieved October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the proper structure, any CSCL strategy can lose its effectiveness. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make students aware of what their goals are, how they should be interacting, potential technological concerns, and the time-frame for the exercise. This framework should enhance the experience for learners by supporting collaboration and creating opportunities for the construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kobbe, L., Weinberger, A., Dillenbourg, P., Harrer, A., Hämäläinen, R., Häkkinen, P. &amp; Fischer, F. (2007) Specifying computer-supported collaboration scripts.  International Journal of Computer Supported Learning,  2(2-3), 211-224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoonenboom, J. (2008). The effect of a script and a structured interface in grounding discussions. International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3(3), 327-41. {{doi|10.1007/s11412-008-9042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important consideration of educators who implement online learning environments is [[affordance]]. Students who are already comfortable with online communication often choose to interact casually. Mediators should pay special attention to make students aware of their expectations for formality online.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, G. &amp; Hesse, F. (2009).  [http://ijcscl.org/?go=contents&amp;article=77#article77  Practice perspectives in CSCL.] International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, 4(2), pp. 109-114&lt;/ref&gt;  While students sometime have frames of reference for online communication, they often do not have all of the skills necessary to solve problems by themselves. Ideally, teachers provide what is called "scaffolding", a platform of knowledge that they can build on. A unique benefit of CSCL is that, given proper teacher facilitation, students can use technology to build learning foundations with their peers. This allows instructors to gauge the difficulty of the tasks presented and make informed decisions about the extent of the scaffolding needed.&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt;

==Effects==
According to Salomon (1995), the possibility of intellectual partnerships with both peers and advanced information technology has changed the criteria for what is counted to be the effects of technology. Instead of only concentrating on the amount and quality of learning outcomes, we need to distinguish between two kinds of effects: that is, "effects with a tool and/or collaborating peers, and effects of these." He used the term called "effects with" which is to describe the changes that take place while one is engaged in intellectual partnership with peers or with a computer tool. For example, the changed quality of problem solving in a team. And he means the word "effects of" more lasting changes that take place when computer-enhanced collaboration teaches students to ask more exact and explicit questions even when not using that system.

===Applications===
It has a number of implications for instructional designers, developers, and teachers.
*First, it revealed what technological features or functions were particularly important and useful to students in the context of writing, and how a CSCL system could be adapted for use for different subject areas, which have specific implications for instructional designers or developers to consider when designing CSCL tools.
*Second, this study also suggested the important role of a teacher in designing the scaffolds, scaffolding the collaborative learning process, and making CSCL a success. Third, it is important that a meaningful, real-world task is designed for CSCL in order to engage students in authentic learning activities of knowledge construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tml.tkk.fi/Opinnot/T-110.556/2003/Materiaali/EditedLehtinenCSCL.pdf|contribution=COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING: AN APPROACH TO POWERFUL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS|author=Erno Lehtinen|editors=E. De Corte, L. Verschaffel, N. Entwistle &amp; J. Van Merriëboer|title=Unravelling basic components and dimensions of powerful learning environments|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, cooperative work in the classroom, using as a tool based technology devices "one to one " where the teacher has a program of classroom management, allows not only the enhancement of teamwork where each member takes responsibilities involving the group, but also a personalized and individualized instruction, adapting to the rhythms of the students, and allowing to achieve the targets set in which has been proposed for them individualized Work Plan.

==Criticism and concerns==
Though CSCL holds promise for enhancing education, it is not without barriers or challenges to successful implementation. Obviously, students or participants need sufficient access to computer technology. Though access to computers has improved in the last 15 to 20 years, teacher attitudes about technology and sufficient access to Internet-connected computers continue to be barriers to more widespread usage of CSCL pedagogy.

Furthermore, instructors find that the time needed to monitor student discourse and review, comment on, and grade student products can be more demanding than what is necessary for traditional face-to-face classrooms. The teacher or professor also has an instructional decision to make regarding the complexity of the problem presented. To warrant collaborative work, the problem must be of sufficient complexity, otherwise teamwork is unnecessary. Also, there is risk in assuming that students instinctively know how to work collaboratively. Though the task may be collaborative by nature, students may still need training on how to work in a truly cooperative process.

Others have noted a concern with the concept of scripting as it pertains to CSCL. There is an issue with possibly over-scripting the CSCL experience and in so doing, creating "fake collaboration".  Such over-scripted collaboration may fail to trigger the social, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that are necessary to true collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="bannon" /&gt;

There is also the concern that the mere availability of the technology tools can create problems. Instructors may be tempted to apply technology to a learning activity that can very adequately be handled without the intervention or support of computers. In the process of students and teachers learning how to use the "user-friendly" technology, they never get to the act of collaboration. As a result, computers become an obstacle to collaboration rather than a supporter of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dillenbourg, P. (2002). [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00190230/fr/ Over-scripting CSCL: The risks of blending collaborative learning with instructional design.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== For second language acquisition ==

=== History ===
The advent of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) as an instructional strategy for [[second language acquisition]] can be traced back to the 1990s. During that time, the internet was growing rapidly, which was one of the key factors that facilitated the process.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. ''The Modern Language Journal, 81''(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the first [[wikis]] (such as [[WikiWikiWeb]]) were still undergoing early development,&lt;ref&gt;Ebersbach, Anja (2008), Wiki: Web Collaboration, Springer Science+Business Media, {{ISBN|3-540-35150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the use of other tools such as electronic discussion groups allowed for equal participation amongst peers, particularly benefiting those who would normally not participate otherwise during face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (1997). Computer-Mediated Collaborative Learning: Theory and Practice. The Modern Language Journal, 81(4), 470-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the establishment of wikis in the 2000s, global research began to emerge regarding their effectiveness in promoting second language acquisition. Some of this research focused on more specific areas such as [[systemic-functional linguistics]], [[humanistic education]], [[experiental learning]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. For example, in 2009 Yu-Ching Chen performed a study to determine the overall effectiveness of wikis in an English as a second language class in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y. (2009). The effect of applying wikis in an English as a foreign language (EFL) class in Taiwan. Dissertation Abstracts International, A: The Humanities and Social Sciences, 69(11), 4300.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is a 2009 study by Greg Kessler in which pre-service, non-native English speaker teachers in a Mexican university were given the task to collaborate on a wiki, which served as the final product for one of their courses. In this study, emphasis was placed on the level of grammatical accuracy achieved by the students throughout the course of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, G. (2009). Student-Initiated Attention to Form in Wiki-Based Collaborative Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 13(1), 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the continual development of technology, other educational tools aside from wikis are being implemented and studied to determine their potential in scaffolding second language acquisition. According to Mark Warschauer (2010), among these are blogs, automated writing evaluation systems, and open-source netbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2010). Invited Commentary: New Tools For Teaching Writing. Language Learning &amp; Technology, 14(1), 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ex situ'' of the classroom, the development of other recent online tools such as [[Livemocha]] (2007) have facilitated language acquisition via member-to-member interactions,&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Clint (Spring 2010). "Livemocha and the Power of Social Language Learning". IH Journal of Education and Development (28).&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating firsthand the impact the advancement of technology has made towards meeting the varying needs of language learners.

=== Effectiveness and perception ===

Studies in the field of [[computer-assisted language learning]] (CALL) have shown that computers provide material and valuable feedback for language learners and that computers can be a positive tool for both individual and collaborative language learning. CALL programs offer the potential for interactions between the language learners and the computer.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2003). English language learning and technology. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, students' [[autonomous language learning]] and [[self-assessment]] can be made widely available through the web.&lt;ref&gt;Chapelle, C. A. (2001). Computer applications in second language acquisition: Foundations for teaching, testing and research. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In CSCL, the computer is not only seen as a potential language tutor by providing assessment for students' responses,&lt;ref&gt;Levy, M. (1997). CALL: Context and conceptualisation. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but also as a tool to give language learners the opportunity to learn from the computer and also via collaboration with other language learners. Juan&lt;ref&gt;Juan, A. A., 1972. (2010). Monitoring and assessment in online collaborative environments: Emergent computational technologies for e-learning support. Hershey, PA: Information Science Reference.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on new models and systems that perform efficient evaluation of student activity in online-based education. Their findings indicate that CSCL environments organized by teachers are useful for students to develop their language skills. Additionally, CSCL increases students' confidence and encourages them to maintain active learning, reducing the passive reliance on teachers' feedback. Using CSCL as a tool in the second language learning classroom has also shown to reduce [[learner anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, S. (2007). Anxiety and non-anxiety in a distance language learning environment: The distance factors as a modifying influence. System, 35(4), 487-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various case studies and projects had been conducted in order to measure the effectiveness and perception of CSCL in a language learning classroom. After a collaborative internet-based project, language learners indicated that their confidence in using the language had increased and that they felt more motivated to learn and use the target language. After analyzing student questionnaires, discussion board entries, final project reports, and student journals, Dooly&lt;ref&gt;Dooly, M. (2007). Joining forces: Promoting metalinguistic awareness through computer-supported collaborative learning. Language Awareness, 16(1), 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that during computer supported collaborative language learning, students have an increased awareness of different aspects of the target language and pay increased attention to their own language learning process. Since the participants of her project were language teacher trainees, she adds that they felt prepared and willing to incorporate online interaction in their own teaching in the future.

=== Cultural considerations ===

[[Culture]] may be thought of as composed of "beliefs, norms, assumptions, knowledge, values, or sets of practice that are shared and form a system".&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, N. (2014). Social and cultural anthropology: The key concepts. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning communities]] focused in whole or part on second language acquisition may often be distinctly multicultural in composition, and as the cultural background of individual learners affects their collaborative norms and practices, this can significantly impact their ability to learn in a CSCL environment.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Anastasios A. Economides. (2008). Culture‐aware collaborative learning. Multicultural Education &amp; Technology Journal, 2(4), 243–267.  http://doi.org/10.1108/17504970810911052&lt;/ref&gt;

CSCL environments are generally valued for the potential to promote collaboration in cross-cultural learning communities. Based on [[social constructivist]] views of learning,&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes.&lt;/ref&gt; many CSCL environments fundamentally emphasize learning as the co-construction of knowledge through the computer-mediated interaction of multivoiced community members. Computer-mediation of the learning process has been found to afford consideration of alternative viewpoints in multicultural/multilingual learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atsumi, T., Misumi, J., Smith, P., Peter, B., Peterson, M., Tayeb, M., … Tanzer, N. (1989). Groups, leadership and social influence. Recent Advances in Social Psychology: An  International Perspective, 369–428.&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to traditional face-to-face environments, computer-mediated learning environments have been shown to result in more equal levels of participation for ESL students in courses with native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, M. (2005). Comparing face-to-face and electronic discussion in the second language classroom. CALICO Journal, 13(2-3), 7–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Language barriers for non-native speakers tend to detract from equal participation in general,&lt;ref&gt;Gunawardena, C. N., Nolla, A. C., Wilson, P. L., Lopez‐Islas, J. R., Ramirez‐Angel, N., &amp; Megchun‐Alpizar, R. M. (2001). A cross‐cultural study of group process and development in online conferences. Distance Education, 22(1), 85–121.&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be alleviated to some extent through the use of technologies which support asynchronous modes of written communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ku, H.-Y., &amp; Lohr, L. L. (2003). A case study of Chinese student's attitudes toward their first online learning experience. Educational Technology Research and  Development, 51(3), 95–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Online learning environments however tend to reflect the cultural, [[epistemological]], and [[pedagogical]] goals and assumptions of their designers.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.php/AJET/article/view/1822&lt;/ref&gt; In computer-supported collaborative learning environments, there is evidence that cultural background may impact learner motivation, attitude towards learning and e-learning, learning preference (style), computer usage, learning behavior and strategies, academic achievement, communication, participation, knowledge transfer, sharing and collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Studies variously comparing Asian, American and Danish and Finnish learners have suggested that learners from different cultures exhibit different interaction patterns with their peers and teachers in online.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K.-J., &amp; Bonk, C. J. (2002). Cross-cultural Comparisons of Online Collaboration. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 8(1), 0–0.  http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2002.tb00163.x&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have shown that difference in Eastern and Western educational cultures, for instance, which are found in traditional environments are also present in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, A., &amp; McQueen, R. J. (1999). Computer assisted adult interactive learning in a multi-cultural environment. Adult Learning, 11(1), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, L., &amp; Ku, H. (2005). Chinese graduate students' experiences and attitudes toward online learning. Educational Media International, 42(1), 33–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J. (2007). A cultural look at information and communication technologies in Eastern education. Educational Technology Research and Development, 55(3), 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt; has described Eastern education as more group-based, teacher-dominated, centrally organized, and examination-oriented than Western approaches. Students who have learned to learn in an Eastern context emphasizing teacher authority and standardized examinations may perform differently in a CSCL environment characterized by [[peer critique]] and co-construction of [[educational artifacts]] as the primary mode of assessment.

==== Design implications ====
A "multiple cultural model" of [[instructional design]] emphasizes variability and flexibility in the process of designing for multicultural inclusiveness, focusing on the development of learning environments reflecting the multicultural realities of society, include multiple ways of teaching and learning, and promote equity of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1994). Reeves' pedagogic model of interactive learning systems and cultural contextuality (pp. 189–203). Presented at the Proceedings of the second  international interactive multimedia symposium, Promaco Conventions Pty. Ltd. Perth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, L. (1996). Instructional design of interactive multimedia: A cultural critique. Educational Technology Research and Development, 44(4), 85–104.&lt;/ref&gt; McLoughlin, C. &amp; Oliver&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, C., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). Designing learning environments for cultural inclusivity: A case study of indigenous online learning at tertiary level. Australasian  Journal of Educational Technology, 16(1). Retrieved from http://ascilite.org.au/ajet/submission/index.&lt;/ref&gt; propose a social, constructivist approach to the design of culturally-sensitive CSCL environments which emphasizes flexibility with regard to specific learning tasks, tools, roles, responsibilities, communication strategies, social interactions, learning goals and modes of assessment [B5]. Constructivist instructional design approaches such as R2D2&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J. (1995). A Recursive, Reflective Instructional Design Model Based on Constructivist-Interpretivist Theory. Educational Technology, 35(6), 5–23.&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasize reflexive, recursive, [[participatory design]] of learning experiences may be employed in developing CSCL which authentically engages learners from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.

== Dyslexia in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning ==

=== History ===
[[Dyslexia]] primarily involves difficulties with reading, spelling and sentence structure, transposition, memory, organization and time management, and lack of confidence.&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"&gt;Woodfine, et. al. (2006). Text-based synchronous e-learning and dyslexia: Not necessarily the perfect match!. Science Direct, 703-717.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia has in the past two decades become increasingly present in research and legislation. The United Kingdom passed the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] in which institutions were required to “reasonably adjust” instruction for students with disabilities, particularly physical and sensory disabilities; in 2002, the [[Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001|Special Education Needs and Disabilities Act]] adjusted the legislation to include learning disabilities.
 
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) established that all students with disabilities must be included in all state and districtwide assessments of student progress. The ADA also guarantees equal accommodation for the disabled in, “employment, public accommodations, state and local government services, transportation, and telecommunications.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In recent years, tools such as WebHelpDyslexia and other capabilities of web applications have increased the availability of tools to provide coping skills for students with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;Avelar, L. O., Rezende, G. C., &amp; Friere, A. P. (2015). WebHelpDyslexia: a browser extension to adapt web content for people with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 67, 150-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on Dyslexia in E-Learning Environments ===
In 2006, Woodfine argued that dyslexia can impact the ability of a student to participate in synchronous e-learning environments, especially if activities being completed are text-based. During experimental qualitative research, Woodfine found that data suggested “learners with dyslexia might suffer from embarrassment, shame and even guilt about their ability to interact with other learners when in a synchronous environment.”&lt;ref name="Woodfine 2006"/&gt;
 
In a study by Fichten et al., it was found that assistive technology can be beneficial in aiding students with the progression of their reading and writing skills. Tools such as spell check or text-to-speech can be helpful to learners with dyslexia by allowing them to focus more on self-expression and less on errors.&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). Personalised learning materials based on dyslexia types: ontological approach.Procedia Computer Science, 60, 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design implications ===

Alsobhi, et al., examined assistive technologies for dyslexic students and concluded that the most fundamental considerations to be had when serving students of this population are: “the learning styles that people with dyslexia exhibit, and how [[assistive technology]] can be adapted to align with these learning behaviors.”&lt;ref name="Alsobhi, A. 2015"/&gt;
 
The [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915012673 Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning] (DAEL) is a suggested a framework that proposes four dimensions that cover 26 attributes. The proposed framework asks educators to make decisions based on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system adaptability:
*perceived ease of use: This refers to the degree to which a student believes that using the technology is free of effort.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alsobhi, A., Khan, N., &amp; Rahanu, H. (2015). DAEL framework: a new adaptive e-learnng framework for students with dyslexia. Procedia Computer Science, 51, 1947-1956.&lt;/ref&gt; One technique to increase the perceived ease of use includes utilizing technology in which self-descriptiveness is present. This, coupled with clarity and logical flow of functions, makes the learning process easier and the interaction between the user and machine more convenient.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*perceived usefulness: Defined as how a student's performance, or learning performance, can be enhanced by a system. Studies show the impact of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and their role in a users’ decision on whether to use a system again. Scaffolding as well as accommodations to the student's learning style will help overcome limitations of system operations, as will feedback geared toward system improvements.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 
*system adaptability: Refers to the user experiences and the way in which students are given control over a system to increase confidence and comfort in their learning. In addition to implications for the system, the flow of content shouldb be logical and the tone (attitude) of content should be encouraging.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== 508 Compliance &amp; the implications for Educators ===
Educators that choose to use the CSCL environment must be aware of [https://www.section508.gov/content/learn 508 compliance] and its legal implications. “In the U.S., the criteria for designing Web pages accessibly are provided by two major sets: the W3C’s [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|Web Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) and the design standards issued under U.S. federal law, [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973|Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act]], as amended in 1998.1 Features of accessible design include, among others, the provision of ALT tags for nontextual elements, such as images, animations and image map hot spots; meaningful link text; logical and persistent page organization, and the inclusion of skip navigation links."&lt;ref&gt;Axel Schmetzke &amp; David Comeaux (2009) Accessibility Trends among Academic Library and Library School Web Sites in the USA and Canada, Journal of Access Services, 6:1-2, 137-152, DOI: 10.1080/15367960802286286&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately, not all educators are exposed to these guidelines, especially if their collegiate programs do not provide exposure to the use of computers, aspects of web design or technology in education. In some cases, it may be advantageous for the educator to collaborate with an instructional technologist or web designer to ensure 508 guidelines are addressed in the desired learning environment for the CSCL.

== Web 3.0 and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) ==
The [[World Wide Web]] began as information sharing on [[Static web page|static webpages]] accessible on a computer through the use of a [[web browser]]. As more interactive capabilities were added, it evolved into [[Web 2.0]], which allowed for [[user-generated content]] and participation (e.g. [[Social networking service|social networking]]). This opened up many new possibilities for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) using the Internet. The internet is now entering a new phase, [[Web 3.0]] or the [[Semantic Web]], which is characterized by the greater [[interconnectivity]] of [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] data from many different sources. New intelligent technology applications will be able to manage, organize and create meaning from this data,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2013-02-08|title=Web 3.0 technology: It's the business!|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/02580541311304571|journal=Strategic Direction|volume=29|issue=3|pages=8–10|doi=10.1108/02580541311304571|issn=0258-0543|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will have a significant impact on CSCL.

The interconnectivity of machine-readable data with semantic tags means that searches will be greatly enhanced. Search results will be more relevant, recommendations of resources will be made based on search terms and results will include [[multimedia]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=Mark|last2=Kendrick|first2=Lynn Marie|date=2015-12-01|title=Toward Education 3.0: Pedagogical Affordances and Implications of Social Software and the Semantic Web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tl.20167/abstract|journal=New Directions for Teaching and Learning|language=en|volume=2015|issue=144|pages=109–119|doi=10.1002/tl.20167|issn=1536-0768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robin D.|date=2011-01-01|title=Web 3.0: Implications for Online Learning|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|journal=TechTrends|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–46|doi=10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9|issn=8756-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halimi|first=Khaled|last2=Seridi-Bouchelaghem|first2=Hassina|date=2015-01-01|title=Semantic web based learning styles identification for social learning environments personalization|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;doi=10.3233/WEB-150307|journal=Web Intelligence|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3–29|doi=10.3233/web-150307|issn=2405-6456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Web 3.0 capabilities for learners include enhanced tools for managing learning, allowing them to [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulate]] and [[Co-regulation|co-regulate]] learning without the assistance of an instructor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Through the use of Web 3.0, groups and communities can be formed according to specific criteria without human input. These communities and groups can provide support to new learners and give experts an opportunity to share their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Teachers can benefit from these same capabilities to manage their teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Ali|date=2002|title=Conceptualizing Intelligent Agents for Learning and Teaching|url=https://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eqm0235.pdf|journal=Educause Quarterly|volume=25 |issue=3|pages=28–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the software for Web 3.0 collaboration will include using data from group communications, which then generates how much each individual has collaborated based on how often they communicate and how long their messages are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Heisawn|last2=Hmelo-Silver|first2=Cindy E.|date=2016-04-02|title=Seven Affordances of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: How to Support Collaborative Learning?

=== Examples of new Web 3.0 tools to enhance CSCL ===

==== Virtual Assistants and Intelligent Agents  ====
Making data machine-readable is leading to the development of [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistants]] and [[intelligent agent]]s. These are tools which can access data on a user's behalf and will be able to assist learners and collaborators in several ways. They can provide personalized and customized search results by accessing data on a variety of platforms, recommend resources based on user information and preferences, manage administrative tasks, communicate with other agents and databases, and help organize information and interactions with collaborators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riaan Rudman|last2=Rikus Bruwer|date=2016-01-20|title=Defining Web 3.0: opportunities and challenges|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/EL-08-2014-0140|journal=The Electronic Library|volume=34|issue=1|pages=132–154|doi=10.1108/el-08-2014-0140|issn=0264-0473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Virtual Learning Communities  ====
Virtual learning communities are [[cyberspace]]s that allow for individual and [[collaborative learning]] to take place. While they exist today, with Web 3.0 they will gain enhanced features enabling more collaborative learning to take place. Some describe them as evolving out of existing [[learning management system]]s (LMSs), adding intelligent agents and virtual assistants that can enhance content searches and deal with administrative and communication tasks,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or enabling different LMSs around the world to communicate with each other, creating an even larger community to share resources and locate potential collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribón|first=Julio César Rodríguez|last2=Villalba|first2=Luis Javier García|last3=Kim|first3=Tai-hoon|date=2015-10-01|title=Virtual learning communities: unsolved troubles|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|language=en|volume=74|issue=19|pages=8505–8519|doi=10.1007/s11042-013-1543-4|issn=1380-7501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual learning communities will also enable different types of peer-to-peer interaction and resource sharing to support co-construction of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Stephen J.H.|date=2006|title=Context Aware Ubiquitous Learning Environments for Peer-to-Peer Collaborative Learning|jstor=jeductechsoci.9.1.188|journal=Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society|volume=9|issue=1|pages=188–201|doi=10.2307/jeductechsoci.9.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities may also include some aspects of 3D gaming and VR.

==== Non-immersive and Immersive 3D Virtual Environments ====
Through the use of [[3D game graphics|3D gaming]], users can simulate lives of others while providing their knowledge throughout the 3D environment as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]. These 3D environments also foster [[simulation]] and scenario building&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for places where users would otherwise not have access. The 3D environments facilitate online knowledge building communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Web 3.0 in education {{!}} Editură acreditată CNCSIS, Editura Universitară|url=http://www.editurauniversitara.ro/carte/education/web_30_in_education/10419|doi=10.5682/2066-026x-12-073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-immersive environments are environments in which not all five senses are used but still allows users to interact in virtual worlds.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Randolph L.|last2=Fagan|first2=Eileen|date=2000|title=Collaboration and Learning Within Immersive Virtual Reality|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/351006.351018|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Collaborative Virtual Environments|series=CVE '00|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=83–92|doi=10.1145/351006.351018|isbn=1581133030}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality headset|Virtual Reality (VR) headsets]] are sometimes used to give users a full immersion experience, into these 3D virtual worlds. This allows users to interact with each other in real time and simulate different learning situations with other users. These learning experiences and environments vary between fields and learning goals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Certain virtual reality headsets allow users to communicate with each other while being in different physical locations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Multimodal literacy development in CSCL ==

=== The concept of Multimodal literacy ===

Multimodal literacy is the way processes of literacy - reading, writing, talking, listening and viewing - are occurring within and around new communication media. (Kress &amp; Jewitt, 2003; Pahl &amp; Rowsell, 2005; Walsh, 2008) It refers to meaning-making that occurs through the reading, viewing, understanding, responding to and producing and interacting with multimedia and digital texts. (Walsh, 2010)

=== Literature review on multi-modal literacy in CSCL ===
==== * Online forum  ====

Online forums offer numerous advantages for both teacher and students for collaborative learning online. Discussion forums provide a wider platform to exchange information and ideas, to develop writing and reading skills, critical thinking skills. (Jill Margerison, 2013) A collaborative online forum can also help students learn about the unique challenges of online communication, especially the need for clarity and the dangers of sarcasm. (Susan Martens-Baker, 2009) For the teacher, they offer a flexible platform from which to educate in a participatory culture, where teachers and students can interact with each other and create new knowledge. (Jill Margerison, 2013)

==== * Video games ====
Video games were designed as a learning tool engaged learners who advance through experimentation, critical thinking and practice in the virtual world. (Abrams, 2009) Video games in CSCL can promote positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face promotive interaction, social skills, and group processing abilities in the ELA classroom. Through interactions in the virtual world, learners have the opportunities to establish their presence, identity and create meanings for their lives.

==== * Multimodal composition in digital storytelling: podcast, video/ audio crafts ====
Digital storytelling refers to integrating a variety of means, such as images, audio, video, graphics and diagram to personal narratives and crafts. Four skill competencies: reading, writing, speaking, and listening would be enhanced by producing digital products. (Brenner, 2014) Students have a greater sense of autonomy, agency through the digital storytelling in CSCL.

=== The implication for classroom teaching ===

==== * Online-forum ====
Online forums provide opportunities for young people to engage in the self-exposition as they practice digital literacies and hone the skill of movement across multiple literacies, languages and subject positions. Meanwhile, identity is a constellation of the multiple communities. It is also important to emphasize the potentially harmful cultural discourses that occur within young people's consumption. (Kim, 2015)

==== * Videogame ====
Through capitalizing on students’ gaming experiences by recognizing how they apply to the subject at hand, teachers can highlight the benefits of virtual learning environments and draw upon students’ gaming experiences to understand their application of virtual learning across curricula. Educators need to choose the appropriate game for the particular subject to endorse their instruction and promote collaboration among students.

==== Multimodal composition: podcast, audio, video crafts in digital storytelling ====
Students who engage in collaborative learning for creating digital production show the characteristics of leadership. Moreover, students would gain the experience of collaboration and expand their skill of the multimodal literacy. In addition, digital composition provides a meaningful tool for teachers to assess. (Brenner, 2014)

=== Applications for ELLs ===

Multimodal literacy can facilitate English learners’ literacy learning. It has provided opportunities for English learners to expand the interpretation of texts. (Ajayi, 2009)  Specifically, English language learners can increase their language ability through computer-collaborative learning. 
The multimodality platforms provide students, especially ELLs with an anxiety-free zone to collaborate with their peers in a virtual world in order to make meanings together. Technology self-efficacy increases ELLs’ level of independence and reduces their level of anxiety. (Mellati, Zangoei &amp; Khademi, 2015) ELLs will have more motivation and self-confident while participating in online group projects to make contributions and share knowledge with their peers. As a result of collaborative learning,  ELLs would expand their vocabulary, gain advanced and more academic grammars.

== CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ==

=== Overview of CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===

====Research on CSCL in post-secondary education settings====
The applications of CSCL in post-secondary education demonstrate positive impacts on students’ learning such as promoting learner interaction, motivation and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang, N., Ghislandi, P., &amp; Dellantonio, S|first=|date=2018|title=Online collaboration in a large university class supports quality teaching|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-017-9564-8|journal=Education Tech Research Dev|volume=66|pages=671–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As collaborative learning is grounded in social constructivism, the interaction and collaboration during learning is valued.

==== Developing Professional Skills ====
There's research findings that shows online students had higher scores than face-to-face students in professional competence acquisition test, showing the effectiveness of CSCL in promoting the development of professional skills&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francescato, D., Mebane, M., Porcelli, R., Attanasio, C., &amp; Pulino, M.|first=|date=2007|title=Developing professional skills and social capital through computer supported collaborative learning in university contexts|url=|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|volume=65(2)|pages=140–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Knowledge Building ====
Knowledge co-construction among geographically dispersed students in an online postgraduate program was explained in a study as students relied heavily on each other for their on-going participation in the online discussions and joint refinement of ideas introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zenios, M|first=|date=2011|title=Epistemic activities and collaborative learning: Towards an analytical model for studying knowledge construction in networked learning settings|url=|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|volume=27(3)|pages=259–268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Principles &amp; Instructional Strategies for CSCL in Post-Secondary Education ===
The design principles for using CSCL can be considered from different perspectives. For technical use, instructors need to provide tutorials and online training modules to students.&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W|first=|date=2012|title=Using an online learning management system as collaborative media to support adult learning: needs assessment|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology in Teaching and Learning|volume=8(2)|pages=135–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For collaboration, students need time to plan and coordinate group work as well as instructors’ support and guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuopala, E., Hyvönen, P.,&amp; Järvelä, S|first=|date=2016|title=Interaction forms in successful collaborative learning in virtual learning environments|url=|journal=Active Learning in Higher Education|volume=17(1)|pages=25–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the discussions. Also, group size and composition should be taken into consideration for better quality of interaction.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y.|first=|date=2017|title=The Effects of Mobile-Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning: Meta-Analysis and Critical Synthesis|url=|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=87|pages=769–805|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More instructional strategies are presented below.

==== Project-Based Settings Using Wikis ====
Wikis is a tool for learners to co-construct knowledge online with the access to create and edit contents. There are three phases of using wikis for collaborative writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin, H. &amp; Kelsey, K.D|first=|date=2009|title=Building networked environment in Wikis: The evolving phases of collaborative learning in a Wikibook project|url=|journal=Educational Computing Research|volume=40(2)|pages=145–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 1. Crisis of Authority

Users experience challenges due to unfamiliarity with the use of wiki and the unknown of other teammates’ boundaries of being commented or revised on their writings.

Phase 2. Crisis of Relationship

Collaborative learning emerges and group communication is improved.

Phase 3. Resolution of Crisis

More frequent communication occurs and increased co-writing among team members.

To better design wiki-based project, the design principles design include:

1. Provide learners with a practice article to edit at the beginning of a course for getting familiar with using wikis

2. Informs learners of different communication tools to work collaboratively.

3. Engage learners with repeated wiki article assignments.

4. Provide timely feedback on students’ discussion, participation and interaction.

==== Online Learning Management Systems ====
The characteristic of social interaction in CSCL can be demonstrated on the online learning community where learners can communicate with each other. One of the medium facilitating the online community to work is online learning management system that provides all people including learners, professors, and administrative staff to communicate.

When using an online learning management system for collaborative learning, the instructor should provide technical training by presenting video tutorials, online training modules or online workshops&lt;ref name="Liu, L. &amp; Lee, W 2012 135–145"/&gt;

==== Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning ====
Mobile CSCL (mCSCL) is beneficial to students’ learning achievements, attitude and interactions.&lt;ref name="Sung, Y.T., Yang, J.M. &amp; Lee, H.Y. 2017 769–805"/&gt; The suggested design principles for mCSCL include:

1. An idea group size is around 3 to 4 people.

2. A duration between 1 and 4 weeks demonstrate better effects

=== Professional Teaching Community ===
Professional teacher communities are positively related to student learning, teacher learning, teacher practice and school culture. Teacher collaboration is a significant element of these communities. Reflection‐oriented tasks (such as reflection on teaching performance in individual writing, peer feedback, and collective writing) stimulated participation, and in combination with task structure also interaction in these communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditte Lockhorst, Wilfried Admiraal &amp; Albert Pilot|first=|date=2010|title=CSCL in teacher training: what learning tasks lead to collaboration?|url=|journal=Technology, Pedagogy and Education|volume=19:1|pages=63–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, structured tasks(such as crossword puzzles, the path to come to a solution is unambiguous and answers can be immediately checked) which required critical reflection on personal experiences and perspectives triggered task‐related communication and a deep level of information exchange.

=== Distance Learning ===
The European Union Comenius fund sponsored FISTE project which is concerned with the educational use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), specifically with the development and dissemination of a new pedagogical strategy for distance learning through in-service teacher education in schools across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsteinsson, G. &amp; Page, T (2007) Computer Supportive Communication Learning Approach to Improve In-Service Teachers’ Education in Europe. FISTE - A Future Way For In-Service Teacher Training Across Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; This project uses the online Virtual Learning Environment platform BSCW as a Computer Supportive Communication Learning tool to facilitate the way the participants work together. This work has involved schools and teacher training providers, building culturally different work in in-service teacher education in the participating countries. The value of using CSCL supported technology for in-service teacher education in Europe lies in the concept of hinterland. Cross-national courses like the FISTE would be difficult to run without this technological approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16305">A '''computerized classification test''' ('''CCT''') refers to, as its name would suggest, a [[Test (student assessment)|test]] that is administered by [[computer]] for the purpose of [[Classification rule|classifying]] examinees.  The most common CCT is a mastery test where the test classifies examinees as "Pass" or "Fail," but the term also includes tests that classify examinees into more than two categories.  While the term may generally be considered to refer to all computer-administered tests for classification, it is usually used to refer to tests that are interactively administered or of variable-length, similar to [[computerized adaptive testing]] (CAT).  Like CAT, variable-length CCTs can accomplish the goal of the test (accurate classification) with a fraction of the number of items used in a conventional fixed-form test.

A CCT requires several components:

# An [[item bank]] calibrated with a psychometric model selected by the test designer
# A starting point
# An item selection [[algorithm]]
# A termination criterion and scoring procedure

The starting point is not a topic of contention; research on CCT primarily investigates the application of different methods for the other three components.  ''Note:'' The termination criterion and scoring procedure are separate in CAT, but the same in CCT because the test is terminated when a classification is made.  Therefore, there are five components that must be specified to design a CAT.

An introduction to CCT is found in Thompson (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, N. A. (2007). A Practitioner’s Guide for Variable-length Computerized Classification Testing. Practical Assessment Research &amp; Evaluation, 12(1). [http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=12&amp;n=1]&lt;/ref&gt; and a book by Parshall, Spray, Kalohn and Davey (2006).&lt;ref&gt;
Parshall, C. G., Spray, J. A., Kalohn, J. C., &amp; Davey, T. (2006).  Practical considerations in computer-based testing.  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;  A bibliography of published CCT research is found below.

== How it works ==
A CCT is very similar to a CAT.  Items are administered one at a time to an examinee.  After the examinee responds to the item, the [[computer]] scores it and determines if the examinee is able to be classified yet.  If they are, the test is terminated and the examinee is classified.  If not, another item is administered.  This process repeats until the examinee is classified or another ending point is satisfied (all items in the bank have been administered, or a maximum test length is reached).

== Psychometric model ==
Two approaches are available for the psychometric model of a CCT: [[classical test theory]] (CTT) and [[item response theory]]  (IRT).  Classical test theory assumes a state model because it is applied by determining item parameters for a sample of examinees determined to be in each category.  For instance, several hundred "masters" and several hundred "nonmasters" might be sampled to determine the difficulty and discrimination for each, but doing so requires that you be able to easily identify a distinct set of people that are in each group.  IRT, on the other hand, assumes a trait model; the knowledge or ability measured by the test is a continuum.  The classification groups will need to be more or less arbitrarily defined along the continuum, such as the use of a cutscore to demarcate masters and nonmasters, but the specification of item parameters assumes a trait model.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  CTT offers greater conceptual simplicity.  More importantly, CTT requires fewer examinees in the sample for calibration of item parameters to be used eventually in the design of the CCT, making it useful for smaller testing programs.  See Frick (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Frick, T. (1992). Computerized Adaptive Mastery Tests as Expert Systems. Journal of Educational Computing Research, 8(2), 187-213.&lt;/ref&gt; for a description of a CTT-based CCT.  Most CCTs, however, utilize IRT.  IRT offers greater specificity, but the most important reason may be that the design of a CCT (and a CAT) is expensive, and is therefore more likely done by a large testing program with extensive resources.  Such a program would likely use IRT.

== Starting point ==
A CCT must have a specified starting point to enable certain algorithms.  If the [[sequential probability ratio test]] is used as the termination criterion, it implicitly assumes a starting ratio of 1.0 (equal probability of the examinee being a master or nonmaster).  If the termination criterion is a [[confidence interval]] approach, a specified starting point on theta must be specified.  Usually, this is 0.0, the center of the [[Probability distribution|distribution]], but it could also be randomly drawn from a certain distribution if the parameters of the examinee distribution are known.  Also, previous information regarding an individual examinee, such as their score the last time they took the test (if re-taking) may be used.

== Item selection ==
In a CCT, items are selected for administration throughout the test, unlike the traditional method of administering a fixed set of items to all examinees.  While this is usually done by individual item, it can also be done in groups of items known as [[testlet]]s (Leucht &amp; Nungester, 1996;&lt;ref&gt;Luecht, R. M., &amp; Nungester, R. J. (1998). Some practical examples of computer-adaptive sequential testing. Journal of Educational Measurement, 35, 229-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Vos &amp; Glas, 2000&lt;ref &gt;Vos, H.J. &amp; Glas, C.A.W. (2000). Testlet-based adaptive mastery testing.  In van der Linden, W.J., and Glas, C.A.W. (Eds.) Computerized Adaptive Testing: Theory and Practice.
&lt;/ref&gt;).

Methods of item selection fall into two categories: cutscore-based and estimate-based.  Cutscore-based methods (also known as sequential selection) maximize the [[information]] provided by the item at the cutscore, or cutscores if there are more than one, regardless of the ability of the examinee.  Estimate-based methods (also known as adaptive selection) maximize information at the current estimate of examinee ability, regardless of the location of the cutscore.  Both work efficiently, but the efficiency depends in part on the termination criterion employed.  Because the [[sequential probability ratio test]] only evaluates probabilities near the cutscore, cutscore-based item selection is more appropriate.  Because the [[confidence interval]] termination criterion is centered around the examinees ability estimate, estimate-based item selection is more appropriate.  This is because the test will make a classification when the confidence interval is small enough to be completely above or below the cutscore (see below).  The confidence interval will be smaller when the standard error of measurement is smaller, and the standard error of measurement will be smaller when there is more information at the theta level of the examinee.

== Termination criterion ==
There are three termination criteria commonly used for CCTs.  [[Bayesian decision theory]] methods offer great flexibility by presenting an infinite choice of loss/utility structures and evaluation considerations, but also introduce greater arbitrariness.  A [[confidence interval]] approach calculates a confidence interval around the examinee's current theta estimate at each point in the test, and classifies the examinee when the interval falls completely within a region of theta that defines a classification.  This was originally known as adaptive mastery testing (Kingsbury &amp; Weiss, 1983), but does not necessarily require adaptive item selection, nor is it limited to the two-classification mastery testing situation.  The [[sequential probability ratio test]] (Reckase, 1983) defines the classification problem as a [[hypothesis test]] that the examinee's theta is equal to a specified point above the cutscore or a specified point below the cutscore.

'''Cooperative learning''' is an educational approach which aims to organize classroom activities into academic and social learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|date=2016|title=Cooperative Learning: Review of Research and Practice|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096789.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Teacher Education|volume=41|pages=39–51|via=eric.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much more to cooperative learning than merely arranging students into groups, and it has been described as "structuring positive interdependence."&lt;ref name="Team Game tounament"&gt;{{cite web|title = Team Game tournament|url = http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=97564&amp;val=613|ref = article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.utschools.ca/utseducation/academicdepartments/science/tgt-nabt_06_2.pdf|title = Team-Games-Tournament:Cooperative Learning and Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.).&lt;ref name="prezi.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = Team game Tournament: Cooperative learning and review|url = https://prezi.com/kn2ooa6sjef_/teams-games-and-tournaments/|ref = ppt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chiu | first1 = M.

(1995). Differentiating cooperative learning to meet the needs of gifted learners: A case for transformational leadership. Journal for the Education of the Gifted, 19, 63-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative learning has also been linked to increased levels of student satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell-Stuart|first=Rebecca|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=Paterson|first3=Audrey S.|last4=O’Gorman|first4=Kevin|last5=Jackson|first5=William|date=2016-11-24|title=Working together to increase student satisfaction: exploring the effects of mode of study and fee status|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2016.1257601|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/03075079.2016.1257601|issn=0307-5079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five essential elements are identified for the successful incorporation of cooperative learning in the classroom:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. W., Johnson, R. T., &amp; Holubec, E. J. (1994). The nuts and bolts of cooperative learning. ^ eMinnesota Minnesota: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[positive interdependence]]
* individual and group accountability
* promotive interaction (face to face)
* teaching the students the required interpersonal and small group skills
* group processing.
According to Johnson and Johnson's [[meta-analysis]], students in cooperative learning settings compared to those in individualistic or competitive learning settings, achieve more, reason better, gain higher [[self-esteem]], like classmates and the learning tasks more and have more perceived [[social support]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D.W.|title=An Educational Psychology Success Story: Social Interdependence Theory and Cooperative Learning|journal=Educational Researcher|date=2009|volume=38|issue=5|pages=365–379|doi=10.3102/0013189x09339057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to World War II, social theorists such as Allport, Watson, Shaw, and Mead began establishing cooperative learning theory after finding that group work was more effective and efficient in quantity, quality, and overall productivity when compared to working alone.&lt;ref name="Gilles"&gt;Gilles, R.M., &amp; Adrian, F. (2003). Cooperative Learning: The social and intellectual Outcomes of Learning in Groups. London: Farmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until 1937 when researchers May and Doob&lt;ref name="MayDoob"&gt;May, M. and Doob, L. (1937). Cooperation and Competition. New York: Social Sciences Research Council&lt;/ref&gt; found that people who cooperate and work together to achieve shared goals, were more successful in attaining outcomes, than those who strived independently to complete the same goals. Furthermore, they found that independent achievers had a greater likelihood of displaying competitive behaviours.

Philosophers and psychologists in the 1930s and 1940s such as [[John Dewey]], [[Kurt Lewin]], and Morton Deutsh also influenced the cooperative learning theory practiced today.&lt;ref name="Sharan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharan | first1 = Y | year = 2010 | title = Cooperative Learning for Academic and Social Gains: valued pedagogy, problematic practice | url = | journal = European Journal of Education | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 300–313 | doi=10.1111/j.1465-3435.2010.01430.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey believed it was important that students develop knowledge and social skills that could be used outside of the classroom, and in the democratic society. This theory portrayed students as active recipients of knowledge by discussing information and answers in groups, engaging in the learning process together rather than being passive receivers of information (e.g., teacher talking, students listening).

Lewin's contributions to cooperative learning were based on the ideas of establishing relationships between group members in order to successfully carry out and achieve the learning goal. Deutsh's contribution to cooperative learning was [[positive interdependence|positive social interdependence]], the idea that the student is responsible for contributing to group knowledge.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;

Since then, David and Roger Johnson have been actively contributing to the cooperative learning theory. In 1975, they identified that cooperative learning promoted mutual liking, better communication, high acceptance and support, as well as demonstrated an increase in a variety of thinking strategies among individuals in the group.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1975"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R. (1975). Learning together and alone, cooperation, competition, and individualization. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Students who showed to be more competitive lacked in their interaction and trust with others, as well as in their emotional involvement with other students.

In 1994 Johnson and Johnson published the 5 elements (positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, social skills, and processing) essential for effective group learning, achievement, and higher-order social, personal and cognitive skills (e.g., problem solving, reasoning, decision-making, planning, organizing, and reflecting).&lt;ref name="Johnson 1994"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R. (1994). Learning together and alone, cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning. Needham Heights, MA: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical base ==
Social [[interdependence theory]]: Social interdependence exists when the outcomes of individuals are affected by their own and others' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D.W.|title=Cooperation and competition: Theory and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of social interdependence: positive (when the actions of individuals promote the achievement of joint goals) and negative (when the actions of individuals obstruct the achievement of each other's goals). Social interdependence may be differentiated from social dependence, independence, and helplessness. Social dependence exists when the goal achievement of Person A is affected by Person B's actions, but the reverse is not true. Social independence exists when the goal achievement of Person A is unaffected by Person B's actions and vice versa. Social helplessness exists when neither the person nor other can influence goal achievement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kurt Lewin proposed that the essence of a group is the interdependence among members that results in the group being a dynamic whole so that a change in the state of any member or subgroup changes the state of any other member or subgroup. Group members are made interdependent through common goals. As members perceive their common goals, a state of tension arises that motivates movement toward the accomplishment of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewin|first1=Kurt|title=A dynamic theory of personality|publisher=New York: McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewin|first1=Kurt|title=Resolving social conflicts|publisher=New York: Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton Deutsch extended Lewin's notions by examining how the tension systems of different people may be interrelated. He conceptualized two types of social interdependence—positive and negative. Positive interdependence exists when there is a positive correlation among individuals' goal attainments; individuals perceive that they can attain their goal if and only if the other individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked attain their goals. Positive interdependence results in promotive interaction. Negative interdependence exists when there is a negative correlation among individuals' goal achievements; individual perceive that they can obtain their goals if and only if the other individuals with whom they are competitively like fail to obtain their goals. Negative interdependence results in oppositional or content interaction. No interdependence exists when there is no correlation among individuals' goal achievements; individuals perceive that the achievement of their goals is unrelated to the goal achievement of others. The basic premise of social interdependence theory is that how participants' goals are structured determines the ways they interact and the interaction pattern determine the outcomes of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deutsch|first1=Morton|title=A theory of cooperation and competition|journal=Human Relations|date=1949|volume=2|pages=129–152|doi=10.1177/001872674900200204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deutsch|first1=Morton|title=Cooperation and trust: Some theoretical notes|date=1962|publisher=Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press|pages=275–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[Introduction to Cooperative Learning#Formal|Formal cooperative learning]] is structured, facilitated, and monitored by the educator over time and is used to achieve group goals in task work (e.g. completing a unit). Any course material or assignment can be adapted to this type of learning, and groups can vary from 2-6 people with discussions lasting from a few minutes up to an entire period. Types of formal cooperative learning strategies include:
# [[Jigsaw (teaching technique)|The jigsaw technique]]
# Assignments that involve [[Group-dynamic game|group problem-solving]] and decision making
# Laboratory or experiment assignments
# Peer review work (e.g. editing writing assignments).
Having experience and developing skill with this type of learning often facilitates informal and base learning.&lt;ref name="JJH"&gt;Johnson, D., Johnson, R., &amp; Holubec, E. (1988). Advanced Cooperative Learning. Edin, MN: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Jigsaw activities are wonderful because the student assumes the role of the teacher on a given topic and is in charge of teaching the topic to a classmate. The idea is that if students can teach something, they have already learned the material.

[[Introduction to cooperative learning#informal|Informal cooperative learning]] incorporates group learning with passive teaching by drawing attention to material through small groups throughout the lesson or by discussion at the end of a lesson, and typically involves groups of two (e.g. turn-to-your-partner discussions). These groups are often temporary and can change from lesson to lesson (very much unlike formal learning where 2 students may be lab partners throughout the entire semester contributing to one another's knowledge of science).

Discussions typically have four components that include formulating a response to questions asked by the educator, sharing responses to the questions asked with a partner, listening to a partner's responses to the same question, and creating a new well-developed answer. This type of learning enables the student to process, consolidate, and retain more information.&lt;ref name="JJH" /&gt;

In group-based cooperative learning, these peer groups gather together over the long term (e.g. over the course of a year, or several years such as in high school or post-secondary studies) to develop and contribute to one another's knowledge mastery on a topic by regularly discussing material, encouraging one another, and supporting the academic and personal success of group members.

[[Base group learning]] (e.g., a long term study group) is effective for learning complex subject matter over the course or semester and establishes caring, supportive peer relationships, which in turn motivates and strengthens the student's commitment to the group's education while increasing self-esteem and self-worth. Base group approaches also make the students accountable to educating their peer group in the event that a member was absent for a lesson. This is effective both for individual learning, as well as social support.

## Each group member has a task/role/responsibility therefore must believe that they are responsible for their learning and that of their group
# Face-to-face promotive interaction
## Members promote each other's success
## Students explain to one another what they have or are learning and assist one another with understanding and completion of assignments
# Individual and group accountability
## Each student must demonstrate mastery of the content being studied
## Each student is accountable for their learning and work, therefore eliminating "[[social loafing]]"
# Social skills
## Social skills that must be taught in order for successful cooperative learning to occur
## Skills include effective communication, interpersonal and group skills
### Leadership
### Decision-making
### Trust-building
### Friendship- development
### Communication

# Group processing
## Group processing occurs when group members (a) reflect on which member actions were helpful and (b) make decision about which actions to continue or change. 
## The purpose of group processing is to clarify and improve the effectiveness with which members carry out the processes necessary to achieve the group's goals.

In order for student achievement to improve considerably, two characteristics must be present:&lt;ref name="Brown 507"&gt;Brown, H., &amp; Ciuffetelli, D.C. (Eds.). (2009). Foundational methods: Understanding teaching and learning, p. 507. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
# When designing cooperative learning tasks and reward structures, individual responsibility and accountability must be identified. Individuals must know exactly what their responsibilities are and that they are accountable to the group in order to reach their goal.
# All group members must be involved in order for the group to complete the task. In order for this to occur each member must have a task that they are responsible for which cannot be completed by any other group member.

There are a great number of cooperative learning techniques available. Some cooperative learning techniques utilize student pairing, while others utilize small groups of four or five students. Hundreds of techniques have been created into structures to use in any content area.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan,S. 1994. Kagan cooperative learning. 2nd ed. San Clemente, CA: Kagan Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the easy to implement structures are think-pair-share, think-pair-write, variations of [[Round Robin (teaching technique)|Round Robin]], and the [[reciprocal teaching]] technique.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"&gt;Schul, J.E. (2011). Revisiting an old friend: The practice and promise of cooperative learning for the twenty-first century. The Social Studies, 102, 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt; A well known cooperative learning technique is the Jigsaw, Jigsaw II and Reverse Jigsaw.

===Think-pair-share===
{{Main|Think-pair-share}}
Originally developed by Frank T. Lyman (1981),&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, F.T. 1981. The responsive classroom discussion: The inclusion of all students. In Mainstreaming Digest, ed. A. Anderson, 109-113. College Park: University of Maryland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; think-pair-share allows students to contemplate a posed question or problem silently. The student may write down thoughts or simply just brainstorm in his or her head. When prompted, the student pairs up with a peer and discusses his or her idea(s) and then listens to the ideas of his or her partner. Following pair dialogue, the teacher solicits responses from the whole group.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"/&gt; When teachers use this technique they don't have to worry about students not volunteering because each student will already have an idea in their heads, therefore, the teacher can call on anyone and increase discussion productivity.

=== Jigsaw ===
{{main|Jigsaw learning technique}}
Students are members of two groups: home group and expert group. In the heterogeneous home group, students are each assigned a different topic. Once a topic has been identified, students leave the home group and group with the other students with their assigned topic. In the new group, students learn the material together before returning to their home group. Once back in their home group, each student is accountable for teaching his or her assigned topic.&lt;ref name="Schul, J.E. 2011"/&gt;

=== Jigsaw II ===
Jigsaw II is [[Robert Slavin]]'s (1980) variation of Jigsaw in which members of the home group are assigned the same material, but focus on separate portions of the material. Each member must become an "expert" on his or her assigned portion and teach the other members of the home group.&lt;ref&gt;Schul, J.E. (2012). Revisiting and old friend: The practice and promise of cooperative learning for the twenty-first century. The Social Studies, 102, 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse jigsaw ===
{{main|Reverse jigsaw}}
This variation was created by Timothy Hedeen (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Heeden,T. 2003. The reverse jigsaw: A process of cooperative learning and discussion. Teaching Sociology 31 (3): 325-332.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the original Jigsaw during the teaching portion of the activity. In the Reverse Jigsaw technique, students in the expert groups teach the whole class rather than return to their home groups to teach the content.

=== Inside-outside circle ===
{{Main|Inside-outside circle}}
This is a cooperative learning strategy in which students form two concentric circles and take turns on rotation to face new partners to answer or discuss the teacher's questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaganonline.com/free_articles/research_and_rationale/313/Effects-of-Communication-on-Student-Learning Effects-of-Communication-on-Student-Learning ]&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to gather variety of information, generate new ideas and solve problems.&lt;ref name="GregoryKuzmich2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gayle H. Gregory|author2=Lin Kuzmich|title=Differentiated Literacy Strategies for Student Growth and Achievement in Grades 7-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XlyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=9 February 2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-1026-1|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reciprocal teaching ===
Brown &amp; Paliscar (1982) developed reciprocal teaching, which - as currently practiced - pertains to the form of guided, cooperative learning that features a [[collaborative learning]] setting between learning leaders and listeners; expert scaffolding by an adult teacher; and, direct instruction, modeling, and practice in the use of simple strategies that facilitate a dialogue structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing, Learning, and Instruction: Essays in Honor of Robert Glaser|last=Resnick|first=Lauren|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=1989|isbn=0805800689|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a model that allows for student pairs to participate in a dialogue about text, partners take turns reading and asking questions of each other, receiving immediate feedback. This approach enables students to use important metacognitive techniques such as clarifying, questioning, predicting, and summarizing. It embraces the idea that students can effectively learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Palinscar, A.S., &amp; Brown, A.L. (1984). Reciprocal teaching of comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring activities. Cognition and Instruction, I (2), 117-175.&lt;/ref&gt; There are empirical studies that show the efficacy of reciprocal teaching even in subjects such as mathematics. For instance, it was found that children who were taught using this strategy showed higher levels of accuracy in mathematical computations in comparison with those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cooperative Learning: The Social and Intellectual Outcomes of Learning in Groups|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|last2=Ashman|first2=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415303400|location=Oxon|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same success has been obtained in the cases of students learning in diverse situations such as those with learning disabilities and those who are at risk of academic failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cooperative Learning: Integrating Theory and Practice|last=Gillies|first=Robyn|publisher=SAGE|year=2007|isbn=9781412940474|location=Los Angeles|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. These studies also cover learners from elementary to college levels.

=== The Williams ===
Students collaborate to answer a big question that is the learning objective. Each group has differentiated questions that increases in cognitive ability to allow students to progress and meet the learning objective.

=== STAD (or Student-Teams-Achievement Divisions) ===
Students are placed in small groups (or [[team]]s). The class in its entirety is presented with a lesson and the students are subsequently tested. Individuals are graded on the team's performance. Although the tests are taken individually, students are encouraged to work together to improve the overall performance of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Seifert and Rosemary Sutton. (2009) Educational Psychology 2nd Edition. "Chapter 9: Facilitating Complex Thinking." pp. 204 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Educational-Psychology.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rally Table ===
Rally Table is another process of cooperative learning. In this process, the class or the students are divided into groups. This is done to encourage group learning, team building and cooperative learning. It is the written version of Robin Table.

===TGT (or Team Game Tournament) ===
Students are placed into small groups to study and prepare for a trivia game. This gives students incentive to learn and have some fun learning the material. This is a group exercise so not one student is to blame

==Introduction==
Team game tournament is an effective technique of cooperative learning wherein groups are created that function in the class for a period of time. In this technique the groups revise a portion of material before writing a written test. This motivates those students that have the fear of writing the test and to learn and reinforce what has been already learnt.
This method is one of the learning strategies designed by Robert Slavin for the purpose of review and mastery in the learning. This method was basically to increase student's skills, increase interaction and self-esteem between students.
In this technique the students study in the class. The material is supplied and are taught in groups or individually through different activities. The students after receiving the material review it and then bring 2-6 points from their study into their assigned groups. Since the tournament is based on a material there is a specific answer.

'''Characteristics'''&lt;ref name="Team Game tounament"/&gt;
# Students are working in hetrogeneous groups.
# Playing the games makes the students to move into homogeneous and higher level groups.
# Understanding other's skills.

=== Method ===

The students compete in the tournament after a designated time to study by forming groups of 3-4 students where the stronger students compete with the weaker students and winner of the respective teams is moved to a high level team while the students who don't score well are moved to an easier level. This ensures that students of the same ability are competing with each other."&lt;ref name="utschools.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.utschools.ca/utseducation/academicdepartments/science/tgt-nabt_06_2.pdf|title = Team-Games-Tournament:Cooperative Learning and Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Purpose'''

TGT enhances student cooperation and friendly competition which allows different students with different capabilities to work together and acquire mastery in the topics assigned to them. The students have the independence to have interactions with different students. The benefit of this activity is that it holds the students responsible for the material they have to prepare.&lt;ref name="prezi.com"/&gt;

'''Advantages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Team game tournament|url = http://syahbella-bellapoenya.blogspot.in/2011/05/effect-of-using-cooperative-learning.html|ref = blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The involvement of students in higher learning.
# The students get excited about learning.
# Knowledge is obtained from the student rather than solely from the teacher.
# Fosters positive attitude in the students, such as cooperation, tolerance.
# Trains students to express or convey ideas.

'''Disadvantages'''&lt;ref name="team game tournament"/&gt;

# It is time consuming for new teachers.
# Requires adequate facilities and infrastructure.
# Can create confusion in the classroom.

TGT is an effective tool to teach mathematics as it motivates and helps students acquire skills and mastery with the help of their peer and through healthy competition.&lt;ref name="eprints.uny.ac.id"/&gt;

== Research evidence ==
Research on cooperative learning demonstrated "overwhelmingly positive" results and confirmed that cooperative modes are [[cross-curricular]].&lt;ref name="Brown 508"&gt;Brown, H., &amp; Ciuffetelli, D.C. (Eds.). (2009). Foundational methods: Understanding teaching and learning, p. 508. Toronto: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative learning requires students to engage in group activities that increase learning and adds other important dimensions.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The positive outcomes include academic gains, improved race relations and increased personal and social development.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; Students who fully participate in group activities, exhibit collaborative behaviors, provide constructive feedback, and cooperate with their groups have a higher likelihood of receiving higher test scores and course grades at the end of the semester.&lt;ref name="Tsay and Brady 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsay|first=Mina|first2=Miranda |last2=Brady|title=A case study of cooperative learning and communication pedagogy: Does working in teams make a difference?|journal=Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=78–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperative learning is an active pedagogy that fosters higher academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Tsay and Brady 2010" /&gt; Cooperative learning has also been found to increase attendance, time on task, enjoyment of school and classes, motivation, and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, D.K., Gruber, K.

Benefits and applicability of cooperative learning:&lt;ref name="Brown 507" /&gt;
*Students demonstrate academic achievement
*Cooperative learning methods are usually equally effective for all ability levels
*Cooperative learning is effective for all ethnic groups
*Student perceptions of one another are enhanced when given the opportunity to work with one another
*Cooperative learning increases self-esteem and self-concept
*Ethnic and physically/mentally handicapped barriers are broken down allowing for positive interactions and friendships to occur

Cooperative learning results in:&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. W.&amp; Johnson, R. T.(1989). Cooperation and competition: Theory and research. Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Increased higher level reasoning
*Increased generation of new ideas and solutions
*Greater transfer of learning between situations

Cooperative learning is significant in business:&lt;ref name="Siltala"/&gt;
*Cooperative learning can be seen as a characteristic of innovative businesses
*The five stage division on cooperative learning creates a useful method of analyzing learning in innovative businesses
*Innovativity connected to cooperative learning seems to make the creation of innovations possible

== Limitations / problems ==
Cooperative Learning has many limitations that could cause the process to be more complicated than first perceived. Sharan (2010) describes the constant evolution of cooperative learning as a threat. Because cooperative learning is constantly changing, there is a possibility that teachers may become confused and lack complete understanding of the method. The fact that cooperative learning is such a dynamic practice means that it can not be used effectively in many situations. Also teachers can get into the habit of relying on cooperative learning as a way to keep students busy. While cooperative learning will consume time, the most effective application of cooperative learning hinges on an active instructor. Teachers implementing cooperative learning may also be challenged with resistance and hostility from students who believe that they are being held back by their slower teammates or by students who are less confident and feel that they are being ignored or demeaned by their team.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;

Students often provide feedback in the form of evaluations or reviews on success of the teamwork experienced during cooperative learning experiences. Peer review and evaluations may not reflect true experiences due to perceived competition among peers. Students might feel pressured into submitting inaccurate evaluations due to bullying. To eliminate such concerns, confidential evaluation processes may help to increase evaluation strength.&lt;ref name="Tsay and Brady 2010"/&gt;

=== Group hate ===
Group hate is defined as "a feeling of dread that arises when facing the possibility of having to work in a group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorensen|first=|date=1981|title=Grouphate: a negative reaction to group work.|url=|journal=International Communication Association|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When students develop group hate their individual performance in the group suffers and in turn the group as a whole suffers. There are many factors that lead students to experience these feelings of group hate some of the more crucial elements include:
* A past bad experience
* Group fatigue (overuse of cooperative learning)
* Simply liking to work alone
When students are given a choice to choose learning activities (group based or individual work) students often evaluate several factors that lead them to a chose if they would like to work in groups or not.&amp;nbsp; The three most common factors listed are: 
* "how likely am I to get a good grade?"
* "how difficult will the task be?" 
* "the amount of effort involved". 
More often the students choose to do the work individually because they feel as if they can do a better job individually than they can as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis &amp; Haywaird|first=|date=2003|title=Choice-based learning: student reactions in an undergraduate organizational communication course|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=52|pages=148–156|doi=10.1080/03634520302467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What factors lead to a student forming group hate? It is difficult to say A, B, and C cause group hate simply due to the fact that each group is unique and everyone is different. However, there are several concerns that lead to students developing group hate. 
* Concerns about the teachers' role
* Concerns about the students' role
* Concerns about fairness and use of resources.&amp;nbsp; 
Concerns about the teachers' role usually stem from lack of communication from the teacher as to what exactly is expected of the group.&amp;nbsp; It is difficult for a teacher to strike the sweet spot of not being a helicopter teacher and remain involved in the project while also not being too "loosey goosey".&amp;nbsp; While a good teacher may be able to strike the balance every time this is a difficult task and most teachers tend to lean one way or the other. This can cause confusion with the students. This is only amplified when the students are put into groups and asked to complete a project with little instructions on how to do so. The way a teacher chooses to structure a project can influence how a student perceives the project overall.&amp;nbsp; Whether or not a student likes a teaching style or not can influence if they develop group hate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen &amp; Plax|first=|date=2002|title=Exploring consequences of group communication in the classroom: unraveling relational learning|url=|journal=New directions in group communication|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next concern that leads students to developing group hate is simply that students get sick of working with the same group members over and over again.&amp;nbsp; Cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is becoming so common that students are beginning to develop group hate simply because they are doing so many group projects. Students express opinion such as "so many group projects with the same people", "we are all up in each others business".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the building of personal relationships can be a positive aspect of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;it can also be a negative if you are having to continually work with people who are constantly letting you down or being difficult to work with.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, it is common to have group members that exhibit signs of loafing within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenn|first=|date=2010|title="Students Give Group Assignments a Failing Grade."|url=|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loafing ===

Loafing is defined as "students who don't take responsibility for their own role, even if it is the smallest role in the group."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isaac|first=Megan|date=March 2012|title=I Hate Group Work social Loafers, Indignant Peers, and the Drama of The Classroom|url=|journal=National Council of Teachers of English|volume=101|pages=83–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students expect that group based learning will be fair for everyone within the group.&amp;nbsp; In order for cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;to be fair the work load must be shared equally within the group.&amp;nbsp; Many students fear that this will not take place.&amp;nbsp; This leads to the students developing group hate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fear that some members of the group will act as passengers or social loafers and derive a benefit (generally a good grade) from the group activity undermines the effectiveness of the group. Some students hoard their intellectual capital to make sure that no one unjustly benefits from it. Ironically, some of the students most indignant about "slackers" or "freeloaders" make immediate assumptions about their peers and insist from the outset that they will have to take care of everything in order to maintain control. There are many ways for a concern about equity to warp the function of a group. Therefore, to make groups more effective, the most important thing an instructor can do to defuse student resistance to cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is to focus attention on the issue of "fairness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order for students not to develop group hate the instructors must be very aware of this process and take steps to insure that the project is "fair".&amp;nbsp; This can be a difficult task.&amp;nbsp; It is often difficult to gage what students are loafing while the project is taking place unless, other students in the group bring the problem to the attention of the instructor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

=== Assessment of groups ===

It is a common practice to have the groups self assess after the project is complete. However, "Assessment can be the Achilles heel of cooperative learning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Boud, Cohen, Sampson|first=|date=2001|title=Peer Learning in Higher Education: Learning from and with Each Other|isbn=978-1138172425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students often will assess their group positively in hopes that they will in return be assessed the same way.&amp;nbsp; This often leads to inaccurate assessments of the group.&amp;nbsp; "For most instructors, one of the greatest pedagogical challenges for a group communication course is to help students realize that the benefits of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;outweigh the costs involved".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=|date=2005|title=Turning Grouphate into competent communication: Shared Governance and the small group classroom.|url=|journal=North Dakota Journal of Speech &amp; Theatre|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group cohesion and conflict management ===

Another aspect of cooperative learning that leads to group members developing group hate is the fact that "groups are unable to achieve sufficient cohesion because they fail to manage conflict effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=|date=2004|title=Instruction based on cooperative learning|url=|journal=Handbook of Research on Learning and Instruction|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students are not usually in a group long enough to develop good group cohesion and establish effective ways to resolve conflict. The problem is that most students have had a negative experience in groups and consequently are apprehensive to get into such a situation again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyton Harmon Frey|first=|date=1996|title=Grouphate: Implications for Teaching Group Communication.|url=|journal=Instructional Development|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; "One answer to this dilemma is to demonstrate how groups trump individuals in terms of problem solving".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If instructors are able to effectively accomplish this it is a positive step towards eliminating group hate.&amp;nbsp;

Group hate exists in almost all student groups.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be because of past bad experiences, concerns about how the project will play out, worries about group members loafing, or not knowing how to effectively manage conflict that may arise within the group.&amp;nbsp; However, group based learning is an important aspect of higher education and should continue to be used. More and more companies are turning towards team based models in order to become more efficient in the work place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; By limiting student feelings of group hate this will lead to students having better group experiences and learning how to work better in groups.

Cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;is becoming more and more popular within the American education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso Wooley|first=|date=2008|title=Harnessing the power of emergent interdependence to promote diverse team collaboration.|url=|journal=Diversity and Groups|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost uncommon not to have some cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;elements within a collage class. However, it is not uncommon to hear students expressing negative opinions regarding cooperative learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myers|first=|date=2012|title=Students' perceptions of classroom group work as a function of group member selection|url=|journal=Communication Teacher|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why is this?&amp;nbsp; Feichtner and Davis&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feichtner &amp; Davis|first=|date=1984|title=Why some groups fail: A survey of students' experiences with learning groups.|url=|journal=Organizational Behavior Teaching Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; put it elegantly by stating, "entirely too many students are leaving the classroom experiencing only the frustrations of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;and not the numerous benefits possible through team based effort". One of the main flaws that we see with previous research is that the research is almost always done from the perspective of the instructor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is giving us a flawed view of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;as the instructors are not the one who are participating in the cooperative learning.&amp;nbsp;

"From the (often blind) viewpoint of instructors, we had always viewed cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;as an added advantage for the students – an opportunity to receive additional support while working closely with their peers.&amp;nbsp; We had never really considered what a disastrous experience some frustrated students must endure, or why some students reported only positive experiences from classes utilizing group learning techniques."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In order to better understand the phenomenon of cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;it is crucial that it be looked at through the student's perspective.&amp;nbsp; It is important to understand what makes cooperative learning &amp;nbsp;successful for some students and unsuccessful for others.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

== Cooperation vs competition vs individualistic efforts ==

There are many reasons why competitors tend to achieve less than they would if they were working cooperatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=Cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning|journal=Journal of Research and Development in Education|date=1978|volume=12|pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there have also been lots of studies making a claim that cooperative learning is more effective than competitive learning and individualistic efforts. But studies also show that competition and individualistic efforts can be constructive and should be encouraged when they are appropriately structured.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Conditions for Constructive Competition
## Winning is relatively unimportant
## All participants have a reasonable chance to win.
## There are clear and specific rules, procedures, and criteria for winning.
# Conditions for Constructive Individualistic Efforts
## Cooperation is too costly, difficult or cumbersome because of the unavailability of skilled potential cooperators or the unavailability of the resources need for cooperation to take place.
## The goal is perceived as important, relevant, and worthwhile
## Participants expect to be successful in achieving their goals.
## The directions for completing the tasks are clear and specific, so participants do not need further clarification on how to proceed and how to evaluate their work.
## What is accomplished will be used subsequently in a cooperative effort.

{{Anthroposophy}}

In the '''[[curriculum]] of the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]]''', much of the education in academic subjects takes place in [[block teaching|blocks]], generally of 3–5 weeks duration. Each pupil generally writes and illustrates a self-created textbook representing the material learned in the block.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"&gt;Todd Oppenheimer, ''Schooling the Imagination'', Atlantic Monthly, Sept. 99&lt;/ref&gt; These blocks are supported by on-going classes in subjects such as music, art and crafts, and foreign languages that continue throughout the year.

==Curricular Approach==

''The Encyclopedia of Education'' describes Waldorf education as a type of [[alternative education|alternative school]] that focuses on a unique curricular and instructional approach. Other schools placed in this category by the encyclopedia are: [[Montessori schools]]; [[open classroom|open classroom schools]]; [[multiple intelligence]] schools; [[Paideia]] schools; [[democratic education|free schools]]; [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] schools; as well as [[Continuous Progress Mathematics|continuous progress schools]] and schools without walls. While each of these schools differ in their educational practice, they are similar in their attention to developing an alternative to [[traditional education|traditional]] approaches to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=James W.|title=The Encyclopedia of Education, Second Edition|year=2003|publisher=MacMillan Reference USA|location=New York|isbn=0028656024|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Waldorf elementary school, the curriculum is presented through extended "main lessons" which focus on one subject in depth. This approach differs from other instructional approaches that allot [[period (school)|equal time to every subject]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Harlow G.|title=Encyclopedia of American Education: A to E Vol. 1|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0816043442|page=1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a Waldorf elementary school, the approximately two-hour-long main lesson "ties one topic to as many disciplines as possible".&lt;ref name="unger"&gt;unger&lt;/ref&gt; The main lesson is not taught from a textbook. The teacher will draw a colored chalk drawing on the board to introduce the theme or subject. The structure of the lesson will include activities that "call upon the child's powers of listening, of body movement, of thinking, and of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=MC|title=Towards Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America|year=1980|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|isbn=0819560626|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities could include mental math, hand clapping games and jumping rope, folk dances, poetry recitation, singing, and writing and drawing in unlined "main lesson books". Teachers are free to include whatever activities they feel will work best for the children in the class.&lt;ref&gt;richards&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, students are taught by subject specialists rather than a class teacher. However, the "main lesson" structure remains. The entire curriculum, which is often discussed as an ascending spiral - or "spiral curriculum" - has been described in the following way

:The year progresses with an in-depth study of, say, mathematics, tying it peripherally each day to allied topics- physics, chemistry, home economics and consumerism – each of which is studied separately in shorter classes later in the day. After a few weeks, one of the peripheral topics becomes the main topic…The result is that all subjects are studied in relation to all other subjects. Students learn what historic events were occurring as Shakespeare wrote ''Hamlet'', what music Newton might have listened to as he made his discoveries…&lt;ref name="unger"/&gt;

The presentation of different subjects may be as follows:

==Language, literature, and history==

In Waldorf education writing and reading are introduced at age six or seven; Beginning with oral storytelling, a Waldorf child listens to and summarizes oral language. Then, using imaginative pictures of sounds (e.g. a snake shape for the letter "s"), the children gradually learn the abstract letter forms, and move on to phonetics, spelling, grammar and punctuation.The literary themes of the first through fourth grades are: [[fairy tales]], [[fables]] and [[saints]] stories, [[Old Testament|Hebrew Testament]], and [[Norse mythology]]. Fifth grade includes a survey of Classical [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Persian mythology|Persian]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythology, as well as the beginnings of Greek history.

In the middle school years, the literary themes are drawn from history. Sixth grade includes [[Roman history]], seventh grade, the history of the [[Medieval history|Medieval]] period, [[Renaissance]], and [[Reformation]], as well as the voyages of world discovery, and eighth grade focuses on the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, including the major revolutionary movements.

After recording their own stories and illustrations in personal books, children learn to read from the words they wrote themselves. From fourth grade on, creative writing focuses on descriptive writing, poetry, and, in the middle school, themes such as wish, wonder, and surprise. In secondary school, courses examine the development of drama, poetry, and the novel. The secondary curriculum generally includes intensive courses focusing on the works of [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], the [[Parsifal]] saga, [[Goethe]]'s [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]], and the [[American transcendentalism|American transcendentalists]].&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="England"&gt;Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 5.2, "Curriculum"&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle school curriculum examines local history, building from studies of traditional life in the immediate environment in fourth grade up through successively larger areas (the locality, country, continent). The  high school history curriculum includes courses on early civilizations, medieval culture, and modern history, as well as specialized courses in the history of the country in which the school is located.&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;

==Mathematics==

Formal instruction in numeracy begins at age 6/7 with the four primary operations of arithmetic. Fractions are introduced at age 9/10, decimal numbers and proportions at age 10/11, percentages and rates of interest at age 11/12, [[algebra]] at age 12/13. At the secondary level, topics include algebra, [[geometry]], [[conic sections|conics]], [[trigonometry]], [[probability]], [[combinatorics]] and [[calculus]]. [[Descriptive geometry]] and [[projective geometry]] are introduced at age 15/16 and 16/17, respectively.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;''The Educational Tasks and Content of the Steiner Waldorf Curriculum'', Edited by Martyn Rawson and Tobias Richter, [[Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship]] 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and science==
[[File:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s approach to nature influences Waldorf schools' teaching of science.]]
Life sciences begin from age 6 or 7 with stories of "the living world."&lt;ref name=RR/&gt; Observation and description of "the living world" begins at age 9 or 10.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; The curriculum includes lesson blocks on [[farming]] (age 9 or 10), [[animal]]s (age 10 or 11), [[plants]] (age 11 or 12), as well as [[geology]], [[human biology]] and [[astronomy]] (age 12 or 13).&lt;ref name="England"/&gt;

At secondary school, Waldorf schools study the historical origins, cultural background, and philosophical roots and consequences of scientific discoveries. Educational scholar Bo Dahlin describes the Waldorf approach to science education as follows: 
{{blockquote|Teaching about any natural phenomenon [begins] with pure observations, for instance of an experiment such as the refraction of light in passing a prism, consciously holding back any theorizing about it. This is followed by as careful as possible reconstructing or recollecting the observed phenomena without them being physically present, followed
by—on the following day—the conceptualization of that which was observed. Attentive dwelling on the observations of the senses enhances the potential of immediate experience to break through the armour of preformed conceptions or ready-made thoughts. The recollection of the observations made earlier stimulates penetration of what was experienced by active thinking. |Dahlin, "On the Path Towards Thinking: Learning from Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner"&lt;ref name=Onthepath/&gt;}}

The pedagogy is influenced by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s phenomenological approach, whereby Nature is conceived as a meaningful whole from which human beings are not alienated. It emphasizes letting the "phenomena themselves speak", using both a genetic method that starts with personal knowledge, out of which conceptual understanding is developed, and an exemplary method that focuses on in-depth investigation of key examples. Dahlin describes the process as "aesthetically rich knowledge formation"&lt;ref name=SSE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Østergaard|first=Edvin|author2=Dahlin, Bo |author3=Hugo, Aksel |title=Doing phenomenology in science education: a research review|journal=Studies in Science Education|date=1 September 2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=93–121|doi=10.1080/03057260802264081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "allows the children’s judgement to mature without 'jumping to conclusions'" and "teaches openmindedness, flexibility, truthfulness, and exactitude in dealing with phenomena of nature."&lt;ref name=Onthepath&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlin|first=Bo|title=On the Path Towards Thinking: Learning from Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|date=November 2009|volume=28|issue=6|pages=537–554|doi=10.1007/s11217-009-9147-1}} Citations that appeared in-line in the original text have not been reproduced here.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
According to a 2009 European [[PISA]] study, Waldorf pupils' ability in science was "far above average" &lt;!--"Dieses Ergebnis passt zum Befund einer Pisa-STudie, nach der Waldorfschüler weit überdurchschnittliche naturwissenschaftliche Kompetenz aufzuweisen haben" --&gt; in the data set used.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;Fanny Jiménez, [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/wissen/article109490665/Wissenschaftler-loben-Waldorfschulen.html  "Wissenschaftler loben Waldorfschulen"], ''Die Welt'', 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 German study found that an above-average number of Waldorf students become teachers, doctors, engineers, scholars of the humanities, and scientists.&lt;ref name=Jimenez/&gt; A 2003 evaluation by education scholars David Jelinek and Li-Ling Sun compared a group of American Waldorf school students to American public school students on three different test variables.&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; Two tests measured verbal and non-verbal logical reasoning and the third was an international [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMMS]] test. The TIMMS test covered scientific understanding of [[magnetism]]. The researchers found that Waldorf school students scored higher than both the public school students (and the national average) on the TIMMS test while scoring the same as the public school students on the logical reasoning tests.&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; However, when the logical reasoning tests measured students' understanding of part-to-whole relations, the Waldorf students also outperformed the public school students.&lt;ref name="SSE"/&gt; Although the study noted the Waldorf students' enthusiasm for science, the science curriculum itself was viewed as "somewhat old-fashioned and out of date, as well as including some doubtful scientific material."&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; Educational researchers Phillip and Glenys Woods (2008), who also reviewed this study, criticize the conclusions about the science curriculum because it means the authors have posed an "unresolved conflict" whereby inaccurate science can lead to better science understanding.&lt;ref name=alt_woods&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Philip A.|title=Alternative Education for the 21st Century Philosophies, Approaches, Visions|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-60276-2|author2=Glenys J. Woods|page=219|quote="There are unresolved conflicts here, principally between a science education based on "inaccurate science" that leads to better scientific understanding."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and geography==

History begins with "mythical and archetypal narrative" (age 6–9 years). At age 10 history lessons begin to draw upon the local environment in connection with local geography. Beginning at age 11, history is introduced as a formal subject.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Throughout elementary school, history is primarily taught through biography, allowing for a human context for historical events.

==Foreign languages==

Generally, two foreign languages are taught from age six on.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Foreign language instruction in the first two years is purely oral; reading and writing of foreign languages are generally introduced toward the end of third grade. Language teaching in the first three years aims to give the children a sense of a greater belonging and understanding of other cultures.&lt;ref name=RR/&gt;

==Art, crafts and handwork==

In the elementary years, drawing is practised daily and painting weekly; in addition, children are taught modelling and sculpture with [[beeswax]] or clay.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Also taught is an approach to drawing geometric and dynamic forms created by the early Waldorf pedagogue [[Hermann von Baravalle]] and known in the schools as "form drawing".&lt;ref name=RR/&gt; Art instruction continues through the high school.

Handwork (including [[knitting]], [[crochet]], [[sewing]] and [[embroidery]]) is taught from age 6 on, with projects which may include cushions, socks, gloves and dolls.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Woodworking normally begins during 5th or 6th grade. The secondary school crafts curriculum includes some combination of [[woodworking]], [[basketry]], [[weaving]] and [[book-binding]].&lt;ref name="Rist"&gt;Rist and Schneider, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000363/036368eo.pdf ''Integrating Vocational and General Education: A Rudolf Steiner School''], Unesco Institute for Education, Hamburg 1979, {{ISBN|92-820-1024-4}}, pp. 74-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

In the elementary school, children sing daily with their class teacher. Generally, bi-weekly general music lessons with a specialized music teacher begin in Grade 1 and continue  through Grade 8. In High school, choir and various instrumental ensembles are continued, until the end of secondary school. Music is integrated into the teaching of academic subjects such as arithmetic, geography, history and science.&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf impulse in education:Schools as communities that educate the whole child by integrating artistic and academic work'', Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University Teachers College, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s, usually [[pentatonic]], are introduced in first grade, the familiar [[diatonic]] recorder in third or fourth grade, when the children also take up a string instrument: either violin, viola or cello. Waldorf pupils are generally required to take private music lessons when a class [[orchestra]] is formed, usually at age 9-10. By age 11-12, the children may switch to [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] or [[brass instrument|brass]] instruments as part of the class orchestra or a separate band. Orchestral instruction continues through the end of a child's Waldorf experience, though in many schools it becomes elective at some point.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"/&gt;

==Eurythmy==

[[Eurythmy]] is a movement art, usually performed to poetry or music, created by Steiner and "meant to help children develop harmoniously with mind, body and soul".&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Eurythmy is a required subject in Waldorf schools in all years.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt;

==Physical education==
Physical Education, or Movement Education as it is called in many Waldorf schools around the world, begins in the early grades with rhythmical activities, then proceeds to various games, the circus arts, the Greek pentathlon, and on to more competitive athletics and team sports as the student moves towards high school.  Bothmer Gymnastics was created by Fritz von Bothmer between 1922 and 1938 out of his work as the physical education teacher at the first Waldorf School established in Stuttgart, Germany. Bothmer Gymnastics™ offers a distinctive, planar approach to age-appropriate balance and coordination exercises.

The '''E-learning maturity model''' (eMM) in [[software engineering]] is a model to assess the capability of electronic [[educational technology]] (e-learning) processes.

== Overview ==
eMM is a quality improvement framework based on the ideas of the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMM) and  [[Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination]] (SPICE) methodologies. The underlying idea that guides the development of the eMM is that the ability of an institution to be effective in any particular area of work is dependent on their capability to engage in high quality processes that are reproducible and able to be extended and sustained as demand grows.

The eMM provides a set of thirty-five processes, divided into five process areas, that define a key aspect of the overall ability of institutions to perform well in the delivery of [[e-learning]]. Each process is selected on the basis of its necessity in the development and maintenance of capability in e-learning. All of the processes have been created after a programme of research and testing, conducted internationally.

== History ==
The eMM is being trialled in the Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot, by the [[University of Manchester]]. Additional projects applying the eMM are underway supported by the [[Scottish Funding Council]] in Scotland and ACODE in [[Australia]]. Development and application of the eMM in [[New Zealand]] was supported by the [[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] Tertiary E-Learning Research Fund.

Version 2 of eMM has changed considerably from the Version 1 of 2003. The eMM and associated documentation is licensed under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-[[ShareAlike]] 2.5 License.

== Topics ==

=== Key idea ===
The key idea underlying the [[Eight Dimensional E-Learning Framework|dimension]] concept is holistic capability. Rather than the eMM measuring progressive levels, it describes the capability of a process from these five synergistic perspectives. An organization that has developed capability on all dimensions for all processes will be more capable than one that has not. Capability at the higher dimensions that is not supported by capability at the lower dimensions will not deliver the desired outcomes; capability at the lower dimensions that is not supported by capability in the higher dimensions will be ''ad hoc'', unsustainable and unresponsive to changing organizational and learner needs.

=== Five dimensions ===
Capability in each process is described by a set of practices organised by dimension.

The eMM supplements the CMM concept of maturity levels, which describe the evolution of the organisation as a whole, with dimensions. The five dimensions of the eMM are:
# Delivery
# Planning
# Definition
# Management
# Optimisation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K–12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S.

'''''Experience and Education''''' is a short book written in 1938 by [[John Dewey]], a pre-eminent educational theorist of the 20th century.  It provides a concise and powerful analysis of [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Experience &amp; Education|year=1938|publisher=Kappa Delta Pi|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-684-83828-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and his other writings on education, Dewey continually emphasizes experience, experiment, purposeful learning, freedom, and other concepts of [[progressive education]]. Dewey argues that the quality of an educational experience is critical and stresses the importance of the social and interactive processes of learning.

==Summary==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2014}}
Dewey was critical of both traditional and progressive education, that is he saw challenges within both educational approaches because they lacked a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Dewey's progressive learning theory is based on the idea that people, even young people, are not just blank slates waiting to be filled with knowledge from kinder through college. Instead, Dewey suggested that students organize fact-based comprehension through meta-cognition, or by building onto prior experiences, preconceptions, and knowledge, and therefore, the educator's role is in creating an educative experience.

===Traditional vs. Progressive Education===
Experience and Education opens by saying that humans organize thoughts, and ideas as "either-ors" and argues that this is mirrored in educational philosophy, namely in what Dewey labels as [[Traditional education|traditional]] vs. progressive education.&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey conceptualizes education as being focused on bodies of information and skills that are passed from one generation to another.
Dewey does not put traditional vs. progressive education against each other; instead, he is critical of teaching methods that are "static"&lt;ref&gt;^ Dewey, John (1938). Experience &amp; Education. New York, NY: Kappa Delta Pi. {{ISBN|0-684-83828-1}}. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and not incorporating enough [[experiential learning]], which he notes young learners are more accustomed to. In addition, Dewey is critical of the old structure and its organization of educational philosophy.

===The Need of a Theory of Experience===
In Chapter 2, The Need of a Theory of Experience, Dewey argues that not all experiences are educative and that, in fact, some experiences can be mis-educative. The central challenge to experience-based learning is to create fruitful experiences and organize them in progression to guide students’ learning. A mis-educative experience stymies the growth of further experiences.  Enjoyable experiences may be mis-educative if they are disconnected and promote dispersive, disintegrated and centrifugal habits.  In traditional schools, people associated boredom with the learning process. The experiences had by teachers and students were of the “wrong kind.” It Is not the absence of experiences in traditional schooling that Dewey finds troubling, but the defective nature of these experiences. Therefore, the educator’s duty is to determine the quality of an experience.  Each experience has two aspects:  the immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and its later impact on further experience.  Educators must think about the experiential continuum—continuity of experiences.

===Criteria of Experience===
In Chapter 3, Criteria of Experience, Dewey delves more deeply into defining what constitutes experience for educational purposes and introduces the concept of directionality on the "experiential continuum". He argues growth can happen in an undesirable direction, as with that of burglars who become proficient at their professions. In this chapter, Dewey also raises questions about the built learning environment and critiques how traditional schools are insular environments rather than interacting with the world, which would promote an understanding of the world and provide a context.  Dewey posits that everything must have a context to be able to draw from it and have it be educational.

===Social Control===
In Chapter 4, Dewey argues that the teacher in a traditional classroom, by nature of the social setting, was concerned mainly with "keeping order."  In a progressive education classroom, social conventions would be enforced by the students who felt a part of the community and not forced on students by the teacher.  Dewey uses the example of children playing games at recess, as he explains "The games involve rules, and these rules order their conduct...As long as the game goes on with a reasonable smoothness, the players do not feel that they are submitting to external imposition, but that they are playing the game."  When things do not go smoothly, the player "may even get angry, but he is not objecting to a rule, but to what he claims is a violation of it." The teacher, in this instance, could act as the umpire or referee to which students would look to arbitrate disputes. In those few instances which the teacher had to intervene directly, as long as the teacher acted on behalf of the interest of the group, children would accept the teacher doing so. Dewey notes that traditional schools, which did not rely upon the establishment of a social learning community, tended to lack this social control, and therefore the teacher only had the option of "direct intervention" to "keep order."

===The Nature of Freedom===
In Chapter 5, Dewey asserts that the freedom of intelligence—the act of freely thinking, observing and judging—is the only freedom of enduring importance.  Unlike traditional schools that enforce quiet and stillness, progressive learning allows teachers to assess their students on a deeper level because of the outward freedom they afford students.  Freedom of movement is also an integral component of physical and mental health.  Although freedom of movement is important, Dewey states outward movement does not always lead to progressive learning.  Instead, Dewey believes that freedom of outer-movement is a means, not an end.  Teachers therefore should address the need for external freedom on an individual basis with each student.  Allowing students’ freedom of intelligence gives them the power to frame purposes, judge wisely, and evaluate their desires.  Students need time to make observations of the world.  Cultivating this freedom of intelligence or power means allowing students ample opportunity to reflect on their natural impulses by “stopping and thinking.”

===The Meaning of Purpose===
In Chapter 6, Dewey maintains that students must feel a sense of purpose in their learning to avoid mental slavery.  Dewey describes a slave as someone who “executes the purpose of another or is enslaved to his own blind desires.”   A genuine purpose consists of impulses, desires that are measured against perceived consequences.  A purpose involves thinking about future consequences resulting from acting upon impulse.  Schooling should not just concern itself with appealing to a student’s desires or impulses.  Educators must help students foresee the consequences of enacted impulses and desires.  More importantly educators must help drive the direction of the purpose.  The formation of purposes involves: observation of objective conditions; an assessment of past experiences with similar conditions; and judgment of observation combined with memory to determine significance.

===Educator's role in creating educative experience&lt;!--not a chapter title--&gt;===
An experience-based model of education implies students learning new material must find a way to ground unfamiliar concepts and ideas within the scope of ordinary life-experience. Progressive education with an emphasis on experience-linked learning relies on the role of the educator to structure material being studied in a manner that facilitates this.

Conversely, students' diverse backgrounds create an infinitely diverse range of experiences for the educator to consider. It is his/her responsibility to organize learning experiences to allow assimilation of new material in a context appreciable by and beneficial to the student. Developing this structure first requires acknowledgement of experience as a vehicle of learning. Subsequently the educator's discretion is important in selecting the material for a course of study and a sensitivity to weaving connections between the students' previous experiences and new material, such that the lesson learned is of greater value.

One of Dewey's preeminent concerns was the educator's role in creating an environment of education that provides continuity within this contextualized experience-based assimilative model of student learning. The difficulty in this challenge lies in continually adapting subject matter to the growing sphere of individual experiences as students progress.

'''''Frames of Reference''''' is a 1960 black-and-white [[educational film]] directed by [[Richard Leacock]], written and presented by [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]], and produced for the [[Physical Science Study Committee]].&lt;ref name="Turner1962"&gt;{{Cite article|last=Turner|first=Joseph|date=4 May 1962| url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/136/3514/357 |title= Art for Science's Sake |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 136 |number = 3514 |page= 359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film was made to be shown in high school physics courses and humor is employed both to hold students' interest and to demonstrate the concepts being discussed. In the film, [[University of Toronto]] [[physics]] professors [[Patterson Hume]] and [[Donald Ivey]] explain the distinction between [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[Non-inertial reference frame|noninertial]] [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]],&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt; while demonstrating these concepts through humorous camera tricks. For example, the film opens with Dr. Hume, who appears to be upside down, accusing Dr. Ivey of being upside down. Only when the pair flip a coin and it floats up does it become obvious that Dr. Ivey&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;and the camera&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; are indeed inverted.&lt;ref name="Turner1962"/&gt;

The term '''graduate placement''' is a statistic used by colleges, universities, and other schools to statistically report the successfulness of their graduated students to find a job in the student's chosen field of study.

It is generally used to indicate the [[efficacy]] of the teaching methods and educational opportunities for prospective students looking for a good school to spend their tuition money.

'''Harcourt Assessment''' was a company that published and distributed educational and psychological assessment tools and therapy resources and provided educational assessment and data management services for national, state, district and local assessments. On January 30, 2008, Harcourt Assessment was merged into [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]]'s [[Pearson Assessment &amp; Information|Assessment &amp; Information]] group after being acquired from [[Reed Elsevier]] for $950 million.&lt;ref name="pearson2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearsonassessments.com/haiweb/Cultures/en-US/Site/Community/PostSecondary/NewsEvents/PressReleases/NewsRelease013008.htm |title=Pearson Completes Acquisition of Harcourt Assessment |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |publisher=Assessment &amp; Information group of Pearson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Harcourt Assessment's history dates to the early part of the 20th century. Although the company name derives from [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace &amp; Company]], which was established in 1919, the corporate heritage goes back to 1905 and the founding of [[World Book Company]]. Many of the educational products produced by Harcourt Assessment originated at World Book. The [[psychological assessment]]s originated at [[The Psychological Corporation]], which was founded in 1921.

===Harcourt Brace &amp; Company (1919)===
[[Alfred Harcourt]] and [[Donald Brace]] were friends at [[Columbia University]] in New York, and both worked for [[Henry Holt &amp; Company]] before founding their own publishing company in 1919. [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace &amp; Company]] published the works of a number of world-renowned writers, including [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Thurber]], [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]].

By 1960, Harcourt Brace led the market in high school textbook publishing, but had little presence in the elementary school market. That year, [[William Jovanovich]], who had become president of the company in 1954, took the company public and merged Harcourt Brace &amp; Company with World Book Company to create Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc.  This was a strategic move that had a long-term impact on the company because World Book was an established elementary textbook publisher and a test publisher.

In 1970, the company became known as Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), with William Jovanovich as chairman. That same year, the company acquired The Psychological Corporation. Under Jovanovich’s leadership, the company diversified into non-publishing businesses such as insurance and business consulting. It also bought several theme parks—including [[SeaWorld]], which it acquired in 1976 for $46 million. The company divested its theme park division in 1989 for $1.1 billion.

===World Book Company (1905)===
World Book Company opened its first office in [[Manila]] in 1905 and published English-language educational materials for schools in the [[Philippines]]. The company later moved to [[New York City]], where it became a test publisher. Much of the company’s success was based on the work of Arthur S. Otis, who was best known for the intelligence tests he developed for the U.S. Army. Millions of World War I draftees took [[Otis-Lennon School Ability Test|Otis’ tests]].

World Book Company became the first publisher of group-administered tests measuring mental ability when it published Otis’ Group Intelligence Scale in 1918. Otis joined World Book in 1921. By the time World Book merged with Harcourt Brace in 1960, it had a portfolio of educational tests, including the [[Stanford Achievement Test]] (1923), the Metropolitan Achievement Test (1932) and the Otis Mental Ability Test (1936).

World Book Company was not related to [[World Book Encyclopedia|World Book, Inc.]], the [[Chicago]]-based publisher of [[encyclopedia]]s and other reference books.

===The Psychological Corporation (1921)===
Psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]] founded The Psychological Corporation in New York in 1921. Cattell was a leading figure in psychology and was the president of the [[American Psychological Association]], as well as founder and editor of [[Scientific monthly|Scientific Monthly]] and head of [[Columbia University]]’s psychology department. At age 60, when Columbia dismissed him because of his public opposition to the draft in World War I, Cattell decided to pursue his interest in publishing. He joined forces with two former graduate students, [[Robert S. Woodworth|Robert Sessions Woodworth]] and [[Edward Thorndike|Edward Lee Thorndike]].

Both were eminent psychologists, and Thorndike was regarded as the foremost authority on the analysis and measurement of learning. The three men started a business to market psychological tests and related materials to educational, corporate and government clients. In 1939, the company published the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scales. [[David Wechsler]] was a former student of Woodworth at Columbia University.
 
In 1970, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich acquired The Psychological Corporation and, in 1976, merged its educational testing department, acquired from World Book Company in 1960, into The Psychological Corporation.

In the 1980s and 1990s, The Psychological Corporation (TPC) expanded through a number of acquisitions. In 1986, the company acquired Merrill Publishing’s test division with its portfolio of tests for language, speech and hearing. In 1993, it acquired Cognitronics Corporation. In 1994, the company acquired Communication Skill Builders/Therapy Skill Builders and its therapy products for speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists and physical therapists.

In 1983, The Psychological Corporation moved from New York to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. When the company moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]], in 1985, it established its own operational services, including customer service, warehouse, distribution, information technology, scoring and reporting services.

In order to establish a stronger identity for its educational assessment products, and to link them more closely to the Harcourt name, The Psychological Corporation’s education testing unit was branded as Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement in 1995. The name was shortened in 1999 to Harcourt Educational Measurement.

===Harcourt General, Harcourt, Inc. and Harcourt Assessment, Inc.===
In 1991, General Cinema Corporation, a diversified company that operated retailers such as [[Neiman Marcus]] and [[Bergdorf Goodman]], as well as a national chain of movie theaters, acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for more than $1.5 billion. In 1993, General Cinema Corporation renamed itself Harcourt General and restored the publishing division’s name to the historic Harcourt Brace &amp; Company. At the end of the year, Harcourt General divested its cinema division.

In 1999, Harcourt General divested its retail division and shortened the publishing division’s name to Harcourt, Inc. That same year, Harcourt, Inc. adopted the brand name Harcourt Assessment for its testing businesses. At the time, Harcourt Assessment comprised The Psychological Corporation, which was known as the clinical division, and Harcourt Educational Measurement, which was known as the education division.

In late 2003, the testing business legally changed its name to Harcourt Assessment, Inc., and unified its two divisions into one operating company.  The company retired the two division names – Harcourt Educational Measurement and The Psychological Corporation – although it retained “PsychCorp” as a brand imprint for select products.

===Reed Elsevier Group plc===
In 2001, the Anglo-Dutch publishing company [[Reed Elsevier]] acquired Harcourt General and Harcourt, Inc., including the business then known as Harcourt Assessment, Inc.  Harcourt Assessment encountered two straight years with mass layoffs as a result of poor management and a failed strategy to expand into the state assessment market. In January 2006, more than 70 workers were laid off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2006/02/13/story7.html Harcourt's recent job cuts due to competitive testing market], ''San Antonio Business Journal'', February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the layoffs, division president Jeff Galt left the company, and was replaced by [[Michael E. Hansen]], who moved from [[Bertelsmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanantonio.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2006/01/30/daily31.html Harcourt Assessment CEO steps down], ''San Antonio Business Journal'', February 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Aug. 7, 2006) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115491671824028439 Who's News Noted …] Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Then again in January 2007, 122 workers lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011807.harcourtcuts.EN.524652b0.html Harcourt Assessment cutting staff by 10 percent], ''San Antonio Express-News'', January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2007, Reed Elsevier announced its intention to sell its education arm, Harcourt Education, of which Harcourt Assessment is a part. According to Reed Chief Executive Crispin Davis, "This is essentially a strategic decision that we want to focus more sharply on our three existing businesses ... with better growth rates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/02/15/uk-reed-results-idUKWLB502120070215?pageNumber=2 |title= Reed Elsevier to sell education arm |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |format= |work= |publisher= Reuters |date=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearson Education plc===
On May 4, 2007, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], the international education and information company, announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com/about-us/education/announcements/?i=352 |title= Pearson acquires Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |format= |work= |publisher=Pearson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the two units left Reed Elsevier with most of Harcourt Education still to sell, comprising its large U.S. textbook business and a number of supplemental publishing businesses. Pearson already held a market-leading position in the U.S. textbook market and would not be interested in the main Harcourt business on account of regulatory concerns. Reed stated that it expected to complete the sale in the second half of the year and would use the funds raised to return cash to shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nic |last=Fildes |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pearson pays $950m for two of Reed's Harcourt Education units |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2514348.ece |work= |publisher=The Independent |date=May 5, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180728/http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2514348.ece |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2008, Pearson completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, Inc., having obtained all necessary regulatory approvals.&lt;ref name="pearson2008" /&gt; Doug Kubach, president of Pearson's [[Pearson Assessment &amp; Information|Assessment &amp; Information]] group, led the integration of Harcourt Assessment into Pearson.

A '''homework coach''' is a category of [[tutor]] whose mission is to help a student's overall academic success as opposed to providing remedial instruction in a specific subject. A parent might hire a homework coach when their child is struggling in school not because they have difficulties with the academic material but because of problems with study skills, organization, [[executive function]] skills and motivation. The goal of the coach is to teach the child to become a successful student by learning to plan assignments, organize materials, manage time effectively and, in the case of an ADHD student, learn ways to manage the symptoms of their attention deficit disorder. As such, the role of a homework coach is similar to [[ADHD coaching]] but is focused specifically on success in school. Some providers use the term "homework helper" as well as "homework coach."

==Applicability==
A homework coach is indicated for any student whose poor performance in school or college appears to be more related to organization and study skills rather than difficulty understanding the instructional material. Such students may show signs of ADHD or Executive Function disorder. Current statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control show that as many as 11% of school children 4–17 years in age had received an ADHD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/features/key-findings-adhd72013.html&lt;/ref&gt; Among ADHD students, about 33% will not graduate high school with their peers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610002001 | doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.06.014 | volume=45 | title=Childhood and adolescent onset psychiatric disorders, substance use, and failure to graduate high school on time | journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research | pages=295–301| pmc=2962709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about twice the rate of the non-ADHD student population.  By hiring a homework coach, parents hope that the added support in building study skills, helping plan assign assignments, test-taking strategies and general homework monitoring will keep their children on track in school and increase their chances of graduating on time.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2010/12/01/homework-helpers-helicopter-parenting/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The efficacy of homework coaching is in general measured by parents in terms of higher grades and less discord in the household over their student's homework habits. One study of 110 ADHD college students found that coaching was "highly effective in helping students improve executive functioning and related skills as measured by the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory." &lt;ref&gt;https://edgefoundation.org/blog/2010/11/12/edge-announces-study-results-11-12-10/&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many anecdotal news stories and case studies relating how a homework coach has helped students improve their grades and self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/nyregion/08homework.html&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity and tempo of homeworkes affect stress resistance and quite emmotsionalny state of the pupil. The correct approach to the implementation of tasks will allow to perform all tasks with maximum efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.assignmentexpert.com/blog/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12277">'''Hypoventilation training''' is a physical training method in which periods of exercise with reduced [[breathing frequency]] are interspersed with periods with normal [[breathing]]. The hypoventilation technique consists of short breath holdings and can be performed in different types of exercise: [[running]], [[cycling]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[Road skating|skating]], etc.

Generally, there are two ways to carry out hypoventilation: at high [[lung volume]] or at low [[lung volume]]. At high lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the [[lung]]s full of air ([[inhalation]] then breath hold). Conversely, during hypoventilation at low lung volume, breath holdings are performed with the lung half full of air. To do so, one has to first [[Exhalation|exhale]] normally, without forcing, then hold one’s breath. This is called the exhale-hold technique.

The scientific studies have shown that only hypoventilation at low [[lung volume]] could lead to both a significant decrease in [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentrations in the body and an increase in [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are indispensable for the method to be effective.&lt;ref name="muscle oxygenation"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00421-010-1512-9 |title=Exercise with hypoventilation induces lower muscle oxygenation and higher blood lactate concentration: Role of hypoxia and hypercapnia |year=2010 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Bourdillon |first2=Nicolas |last3=Vandewalle |first3=Henri |last4=Lamberto |first4=Christine |last5=Mollard |first5=Pascal |last6=Richalet |first6=Jean-Paul |last7=Pichon |first7=Aurélien |journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=367–77 |pmid=20503056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimming"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2013.08.022 |title=Swimmers can train in hypoxia at sea level through voluntary hypoventilation |year=2014 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Gamelin |first2=François-Xavier |last3=Lamberto |first3=Christine |last4=Pichon |first4=Aurélien |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean Paul |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=190 |pages=33–9 |pmid=24012989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first known form of hypoventilation occurred in the 1950s during training of the [[runners]] of [[Eastern Europe]] and former [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Woorons, "[http://www.hypoventilation-training.com/Activity.html Hypoventilation training, push your limits!]", Arpeh, 2014, p. 21 ({{ISBN|978-2-9546040-1-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous athletes to have used this method is [[Emil Zátopek]], the [[Czechs|Czech]] long-distance runner, 4 times [[Olympic gold medalist]] and former holder of 18 world records. Zátopek, who was a precursor in training, regularly used to run by holding his breath in order to harden his training and simulate the conditions of competition. However, at that time, the effects of hypoventilation training were completely unknown and the method was applied very empirically.

At the beginning of the 1970s, American [[swimming (sport)|swim]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] [[James Counsilman]] used a new training technique which involved taking a limited number of [[inhalation]]s while swimming laps in a pool. The effect of this kind of training was determined to decrease the body’s [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] content and simulate [[altitude training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Counsilman |first1=J. |title=Hypoxic training and other methods of training evaluated |journal=Swim Tech |year=1975 |volume=12 |pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the method's efficacy, hypoventilation became a common training method for many swimmers.

It is especially from the 1980s that the scientific studies on exercise with reduced [[breathing frequency]] began to be published. While the method advocated by Counsilman attracted a following in some runners and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] coaches, the results of the studies contradicted the hypotheses put forward by the World of Sport. They showed that this training method did not decrease body [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations and provoked only a [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] effect, i.e. an increase in [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmer |first1=I |last2=Gullstrand |first2=L |title=Physiological responses to swimming with controlled frequency of breathing |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports |year=1980 |volume=2 |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1249/00005768-198021000-00005 |title=Respiratory and heart rate responses to tethered controlled frequency breathing swimming |year=1980 |last1=Dicker |first1=Scott G. |last2=Lofthus |first2=Geraldine K. |last3=Thornton |first3=Norton W. |last4=Bkooks |first4=George A. |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=12 |pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the effectiveness and legitimacy of hypoventilation training were strongly challenged.

Since the middle of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], a series of studies has been conducted by French [[researchers]] of Paris 13 University to propose a new approach to hypoventilation training. Dr Xavier Woorons and his team hypothesized that if breath holdings were carried out with the [[lung]]s half-full of air, rather than full of air as performed so far, it would be possible to significantly reduce body oxygenation. The results that were published confirmed the hypotheses. They demonstrated that through hypoventilation at low [[lung volume]], that is the exhale-hold technique, it was possible, without leaving [[sea level]], to decrease [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations in the [[blood]] and in the [[muscle]]s at levels corresponding to altitudes above 2000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.02.017 |title=Prolonged expiration down to residual volume leads to severe arterial hypoxemia in athletes during submaximal exercise |year=2007 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Mollard |first2=Pascal |last3=Pichon |first3=Aurélien |last4=Duvallet |first4=Alain |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean-Paul |last6=Lamberto |first6=Christine |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=158 |pages=75–82 |pmid=17434347 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological effects ==
When exercise is being performed, if the exhale-hold technique is properly applied, a decrease in [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations and an increase in [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentrations occur in the [[lung]]s, the [[blood]] and the [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref name="muscle oxygenation" /&gt; The combined effect of [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and [[hypercapnia]] act as a strong [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] whose main consequence is to increase [[lactic acid]] and [[hydrogen]] ions production, and therefore to provoke a strong [[acidosis]] in the body. Thus, during exercise with hypoventilation, the [[blood]] and [[muscle]] [[acid-base homeostasis]] is highly disturbed. The studies have also reported an increase in all [[heart]] activity when hypoventilation is carried out in terrestrial sports. [[Cardiac output]], [[heart rate]], [[stroke volume]] and sympathetic modulation to the heart are greater when exercise with hypoventilation is performed in [[running]] or [[cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1271788 |title=Cardiovascular Responses During Hypoventilation at Exercise |year=2011 |last1=Woorons |first1=X. |last2=Bourdillon |first2=N. |last3=Lamberto |first3=C. |last4=Vandewalle |first4=H. |last5=Richalet |first5=J.-P. |last6=Mollard |first6=P. |last7=Pichon |first7=A. |journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=438–45 |pmid=21563023}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly higher [[blood pressure]] has also been recorded. In [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] on the other hand, no significant change in the [[heart]] activity has been found.&lt;ref name="swimming" /&gt;

After several weeks of hypoventilation training, physiological adaptations occur that delay the onset of [[acidosis]] during a maximal exertion test. The studies have shown that at a given workload, [[pH]] and [[blood]] [[bicarbonate]] concentrations were higher, whereas [[lactic acid|lactate]] concentrations had a tendency to decrease. The reduction in [[acidosis]] would be due to an improvement in buffer capacity at the [[muscle]] level. However, no change advantageous to aerobic [[metabolism]] has been found. [[Maximal oxygen uptake]] (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max), the number of [[red blood cells]] and the anaerobic threshold were not modified after hypoventilation training.

== Benefits of the method ==
By delaying [[acidosis]], hypoventilation training would also delay the onset of [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and would therefore improve performance during strenuous exertions of short to moderate durations. After several weeks of hypoventilation training, performance gains between 1 and 4% have been reported in [[running]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.09.010 |title=Effects of a 4-week training with voluntary hypoventilation carried out at low pulmonary volumes |year=2008 |last1=Woorons |first1=Xavier |last2=Mollard |first2=Pascal |last3=Pichon |first3=Aurélien |last4=Duvallet |first4=Alain |last5=Richalet |first5=Jean-Paul |last6=Lamberto |first6=Christine |journal=Respiratory Physiology &amp; Neurobiology |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=123–30 |pmid=18160351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HV: l'altitude à p'tit prix! |year=2010 |url=http://apps.ysf-fsj.ca/virtualcwsf/projectdetails.php?switchlanguage=en&amp;id=2436}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/sms.12140 |title=Controlled-frequency breath swimming improves swimming performance and running economy |year=2013 |last1=Lavin |first1=K.

Another advantage of hypoventilation training is to stimulate the anaerobic [[metabolism]] without using high exercise intensities, which are more traumatizing for the [[Human musculoskeletal system|locomotor system]] and therefore increase the risk of injuries. Athletes who return progressively to their sporting activity after being injured, and who therefore have to protect their [[muscle]]s, [[joint]]s or [[tendon]]s, could train at low or moderate intensity with hypoventilation.

== Disadvantages of the method ==
Hypoventilation training is physically demanding. This method is intended for highly motivated athletes, who do not have pulmonary or cardiovascular issues and whose primary objective is performance. Furthermore, exercising with hypoventilation can provoke [[headache]]s if the breath holdings are maintained too long or repeated over a too long period of time. Finally, this training method does not seem to be beneficial for [[endurance sport]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''Informal learning''' is any learning that is not [[formal learning]] or [[non-formal learning]], such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.

The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education.  The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in [[communities of practice]], to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to [[observational learning|observe]] and participate in social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizations==
[[File:Open House Day 2015 Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Open House Day at [[ESO]]’s Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House Day 2015 – Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1526a/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Informal learning can be characterized as the following:
* It usually takes place outside [[education]]al [[school|establishments]];
* It does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements;
* It is not necessarily planned [[pedagogically]], systematically according to fixed [[course (education)|subject]]s, [[test (student assessment)|test]] and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for [[life]];
* It is experienced directly in its "[[Nature (philosophy)|natural]]" function of everyday life.
* It is often spontaneous and creative.
* It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] (LOPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching-In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities.

==History==
In international discussions, the concept of informal learning, already used by [[John Dewey]] at an early stage and later on by [[Malcolm Knowles]], experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and [[nonformal learning]] in courses ([[P. H. Coombs|Coombs]]/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions ([[K. Watkins|Watkins]]/Marsick, p.&amp;nbsp;12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards [[autodidactic]] and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner ([[D. W. Livingstone|Livingstone]] 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68 et seq.).

==Differences between informal and non-formal learning==
{{main|Non-formal learning}}
As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars.

==Other perspective==
Merriam et al. (2007) state: "Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990, p. 6)" (p.&amp;nbsp;36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as "a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images" (Bennett, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4) and she theorized two possible sub-processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge.

==In American Indigenous communities==
People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=B|author2=L. Alcala |author3=A. Coppens |author4=A. Lopez |author5=O. Ruvalcaba |author6=K. Silva |title=Pitching in and catching on: Learning through intent community participation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These learning experiences rely on children’s incorporation in the community and the child’s attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in.

Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pewewardy|first1=Cornel|title=Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska native students: A review of the literature and implications for practice|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=2002|volume=41|issue=3|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvit.bc.ca/docs/learning%20styles%20of%20american%20indianalaska%20native%20students%20a%20review%20of%20the%20literature%20and%20implications%20for%20practice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Children can be seen participating alongside adults in many daily activities within the community. An example is the process where children learn slash-and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskins|first=S|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico|last = Alcala|first = et. al.|date = 2014|journal = Human Development |doi = 10.1159/000356763|pmid = |access-date =|volume=57|issue = 2–3|pages=96–115|bibcode = 2001HuDev..44..103S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors. Their roles as learner and expert are flexible, while the observer participates with active concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R|author2=B. Rogoff2|title=Side-by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychology and Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]], experiential learning, and apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=M|title=Indigenous Knowledge and Research: The Míkiwáhp as a Symbol for Reclaiming Our Knowledge and Ways of Knowing|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/26/64|journal=The First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]], alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children’s time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göncü|first=A.|title=Children’s and researchers’ engagement in the world|journal=Library of Congress Catalog|year=1999|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the-holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children |journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 55–66|volume = 38|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|first = Pablo|last = Chavajay|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Rogoff|pmid=11806702|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is part of a child’s development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=M.|author2=D. Levison |author3=D. White |author4=W. Myers |title=A place for work in children’s lives?|journal=Plan|year=2009|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circumstances of everyday routine create opportunities for the culturally meaningful activities and sensitive interactions on which a child's development depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farver|first=J.A.M.|title=Activity setting analysis: A model for examining the role of culture in development|journal=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1999|pages=99–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of the Chillihuani observe their environment as a place of respect, and learn from observation. Many of them become herders by informal learning in observation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-70982-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebel|first=M.|title=The dignity of the working child: What children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala think about their work|journal=Working Children's Protagonism: Social Movements and Empowerment in Latin America, Africa and India|year=2001|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children’s social interaction and behavior occur.  Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskin|first=S.|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication as a learning tool===

In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture’s definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the native american student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain.In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. "Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development." Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3195944|title = Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to be Separate-but-Together|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 156–172|last1 = Paradise|first1 = Ruth|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ennew | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Growing up in a culture of respect: child rearing in highland Peru – By Bolin, Inge | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 168–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01604_5.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, E., &amp; Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal and informal education==
To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms "formal" and "informal" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic,  while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students.

==Research and data==
Merriam and others (2007) state: "studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, &amp; Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs" (p.&amp;nbsp;35–36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form.

==Experiences and examples==
Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, "At the Water Cooler of Learning" in Conner, M. L., &amp; Clawson, J.G. (eds.) "Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of [[language acquisition]], a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a 
formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). "Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non-Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring.

Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager.

Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person.

In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in "The Learning Revolution" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries—which offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, "meet the author" events and family history sessions—to run activities such as [http://www.northeastlibraries.org.uk The North East Festival of Learning].

==Trends in formal and informal learning==
40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and [[situational]] in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on [[on-the-job training]].

Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and [[interpersonal skills]] that the “unskilled” labor force requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.

==Business perspective==
The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part—25%—of the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively "adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything.

==Summary==
Lifelong learning, as defined by the [[OECD]], includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

'''Instructional animations''' are [[animation]]s that are used either to provide instructions for immediate performance of a task or to support more permanent [[education|learning]] of subject matter. While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term [[educational animation]] may be preferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16364">'''Just-in-time teaching''' (often abbreviated as '''JiTT''') is a pedagogical strategy that uses [[feedback]] between classroom activities and work that students do at home, in preparation for the classroom meeting. The goals are to increase [[learning]] during classroom time, to enhance student [[motivation]], to encourage students to  prepare for class, and to allow the instructor to fine-tune the classroom activities to best meet students' needs.

== History ==

Just-in-time teaching was developed for university level [[physics]] instructors in the late 1990s, but its use has since spread to many other academic disciplines. Early work was done in the physics department at [[IUPUI|Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]] (IUPUI) in collaboration with physics instructors at [[Davidson College]] and the [[United States Air Force Academy]] (USAFA).&lt;ref&gt;Novak, GN, Patterson, ET, Gavrin, A, and Christian, W (1999), ''Just-in-Time Teaching: Blending active Learning and Web Technology'', Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-085034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, JiTT was disseminated through a combination of publications, presentations, and workshops. Faculty members teaching in disciplines including [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[geology]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[economics]], [[history]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[philosophy]], [[journalism]], [[nursing]], [[music]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[Composition studies|writing]] have adopted just-in-time teaching. JiTT is used primarily at the college level, although some faculty members have used it at the high school level, and in graduate and professional programs.

== Methodology ==
JiTT may be described as a method by which some or all of the time students spend in preparation for class is used to leverage the quality of the time spent in class. To accomplish this, JiTT relies on pre-class assignments completed by students 1–24 hours before class meetings. These assignments are known variously as "Warmup exercises", "Preflight checks", "Checkpoints", and other names, depending on institutional settings. These assignments are usually completed online, either through a course [[website]], or through a [[learning management system]]. The pre-class assignments cover the material that will be introduced in the subsequent class, and should be answered based on students' reading or other preparation. As a result, these assignments provide a strong incentive for students to complete the assigned reading or other preparatory work before class. For this reason, JiTT has been compared to the use of "reading quizzes". However, there are important differences.

Reading quizzes are generally given during class time. Since the pre-class JiTT assignment is completed online, no class time is used. Also, because students have more time to answer the pre-class questions than they do a typical reading quiz, the questions may be more open-ended and thought-provoking. This leads to another significant difference.

Most faculty members make the pre-class assignment due at least 1 hour before class. This allows the faculty member to review the students' answers before class. In most cases, faculty members use this review to make adjustments to the planned classroom activities. If the faculty member feels that the students have mastered a topic, she may reduce or eliminate discussion of that topic during class. Similarly, if the pre-class assignment shows that students have particular difficulties, those difficulties may be addressed more thoroughly in class. These "just-in-time" adjustments lend their name to the technique, just as [[Just in time (business)|Just-in-Time business]] strategies rely on continuous adjustments to [[Supply (economics)|parts supplies]] and product [[inventory]].

Faculty using just-in-time teaching often use quotes from students' responses to the pre-class assignments as "talking points" during the class period. This emphasis on student work as the starting point or as a touchstone during class helps to make the class more [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]], and promotes [[interactive learning]]. To maximize the potential for this use, the questions posed in pre-class assignments should be open-ended and may be somewhat ambiguous.

Taking the full set of methods described above into account, the cycle for a single classroom meeting is as follows.
# Students complete reading or other preparatory work
# Students complete pre-class assignment
# Faculty member reviews pre-class assignments, and considers changes to classroom emphasis.
# Faculty member selects quotes from pre-class assignments to refer to during class.
# During class, faculty member uses quotes from student work to lead discussion of the material.
# During class, students engage in discussion of the material with the faculty member and with one another.
# Faculty member creates or adjusts next pre-class assignment to best meet students' needs in light of progress made during class.

== Theoretical basis ==
Just-in-time teaching had its origins in the classrooms where faculty were looking for more effective ways to engage a particular audience – [[non-traditional student]]s. Eventually it found its way into virtually all [[higher education]] environments. Initially the [[pedagogy]] evolved mostly by trial and error, although, from the start, many JiTT practitioners were paying attention to the [[education research]] literature. Over the years JiTT attention shifted to the broader questions of which aspects of the technique worked well, which not so well, and why. In order to answer those questions it is necessary to examine the knowledge about teaching and learning that has accumulated over the past half century.

JiTT assignments and classroom activities are designed to motivate the students to examine their present knowledge and get ready to modify such knowledge, add to it and then apply the newly constructed knowledge. These tasks are accomplished as students and instructors work as a team in a debate-like environment. In this way JiTT is supportive of the three main factors identified by [[Alexander Astin]] as contributing to success in college: student-student interaction, student-faculty interaction and time on task.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, (1993), ''What matters in college? Four critical years revisited'', San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7879-0838-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JiTT learning units start with an examination, by the student, of his/her current knowledge status regarding the topic to be studied, and with an examination of motivational beliefs that determine the student's approach to the topic. This approach is currently favored in any setting, but it is particularly appropriate when the audience is [[non-traditional student]]s who need to be given some control over what they do to avoid slipping into [[Student approaches to learning|surface learning]] which creates a [[dichotomy]] between their other (to them meaningful) activities and going to school (not to learn but to get certified for something.)

JiTT  activities are designed to foster [[conceptual change]], described in research literature as modification of existing knowledge. In the sciences in particular, learning is seen both as accretion of new knowledge and change of existing knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, PH, Asoko HM, and Driver, RH (1991). Teaching for Conceptual Change: A Review of Strategies in ''Research in Physics Learning: Theoretical Issues and Empirical Studies  Proceedings of an International Workshop'',  R. Duit, F. Goldberg, H. Niederer (Eds.)  March 1991  IPN 131,  {{ISBN|3-89088-062-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Preflights have been linked to assessment and feedback, threshold concepts and criterion referencing.&lt;ref&gt;Whalley, WB, (2013) Teaching with assessment, feedback and feedforward: using 'preflights' to assist student achievement, in ''For the love of learning, Innovations from outstanding university teachers'', Bilham, T (Ed), Palgrave Macmillan, 97-102. {{ISBN|978-1-137-33429-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

JiTT activities also take into account motivational factors governing student behavior. Motivational belief theorists take the [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] position that "the process of conceptual change is influenced by personal, motivational, social, and historical processes, thereby advocating a hot model of individual conceptual change".&lt;ref&gt;Pintrich, PR, Marx, RW, Boyle, RA  (1993).  Beyond cold conceptual change: The role of motivational beliefs and classroom contextual factors in the process of conceptual change.  Review of Educational Research, '''63''', 167-199; Pintrich, PR, Schunk, DH (2002).  ''Motivation in education: Theory, research, and Applications'' (2nd Ed.).   Columbus, OH: Merrill-Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0-13-016009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that college students who report that their course material is more interesting, important, and useful to them are more likely to use deeper processing strategies like elaboration and metacognitive control strategies. "At the classroom and task level, there are a number of features that could increase students' situational interest – such as challenge, choice, novelty, fantasy, and surprise."&lt;ref&gt;Malone, TW and Lepper, MR (1987), Making learning fun: A taxonomy of intrinsic motivations for learning.  In RE Snow and MJ Farr (Eds.), Aptitude, Learning and Instruction III: Cognitive and Affective Process Analyses.  Hillsdale, N.J.: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
[[Educational assessment|Assessment]] in just-in-time teaching connotes many ideas. JiTT assignments are themselves a type of [[formative assessment]]. They provide students frequent opportunities to consider their understanding of the material, and  they provide faculty a regular sightline into their students' progress towards [[deeper learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Novak, G and Patterson, ET (2010), "Getting Started with JiTT" in ''Just-in-Time Teaching: Across the Disciplines, Across the Academy'', Simkins S, and Maier M (Eds.), Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-57922-293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Successful implementation of JiTT leads to cognitive gains, ranging from moderate to quite significant. Success depends critically on the teacher and students' total buy-in. If students see the on-line assignments merely as an add-on to the course, to be completed perfunctorily in the shortest time possible and then discussed briefly at the beginning of class, before the "real" lecture, they will resent the extra work and will not get any additional benefit from JiTT. Teachers using JiTT report a spectrum of results, ranging from significant affective and cognitive gains to very negative student reactions, disillusionment, and sometimes a regression in learning gains.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, ME., Middendorf, J and Sullivan, CS (2010), "Using Just-in-Time Teaching to Motivate Student Learning" in ''Just-in-Time Teaching: Across the Disciplines, Across the Academy'', Simkins S, and Maier M (Eds.), Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-57922-293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of successful JiTT comes from a five-semester study at [[North Georgia College &amp; State University]].  This study analyzed responses from four [[Concept inventory|force concept inventory]] (FCI) questions (the distractors as well as the correct answers) for evidence of students reaching the transition threshold from "common sense thinking to Newtonian thinking", a well-defined notion in [[physics]] education.&lt;ref&gt;Formica, SP, Easley, JL, and Spraker, MC (2010), "Transforming common-sense beliefs into Newtonian thinking through Just-In-Time Teaching," Phys. Rev. ST Physics Ed. Research '''6''', 020106.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sixty-one percent of the students in the JiTT class reached the threshold, compared to only seven percent in the traditionally taught class. Marrs reported similar gains on pre-post assessment in biology, using the Hake metric, defined as (posttest% – pretest%)/(100% – pretest%).  With traditional lecture-based pedagogy the gain was 16.7%; the gain jumped to 52.3% with JiTT and to 63.6% with collaborative learning.&lt;ref&gt;Marrs KA, Blake, R, and Gavrin, A (2003), Use of Warm Up Exercises in Just in Time Teaching: Determining Students' Prior Knowledge and Misconceptions in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Journal of College Science Teaching, September 2003, pp. 42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of JiTT at the [[United States Air Force Academy|US Air Force Academy]], the final exam questions in the introductory [[physics]] sequence have shifted significantly towards conceptual probing for deeper understanding. Analyzing carefully kept records from the pre-JiTT early 1990s until the present, one finds that despite the increasingly more challenging questions, the scores have held steady and even improved in some semesters.

When JiTT was introduced in introductory [[physics]] at [[IUPUI]] in 1996 course attendance increased from under 50% to over 80%. Instructors in other disciplines have reported similar results. Better attendance inevitably leads to fewer students dropping the class and an overall rise in grades. In JiTT [[Physics]] and in [[Biology]] courses at [[IUPUI]] the D/F/W numbers decreased from 40% to under 25%.

JiTT can make a difference in student study skills. Students in Marrs' [[biology]] class credit JiTT to a significant decrease in [[Cramming (education)|cramming]] for tests. She asked her students "Did you put off studying for Biotech 540 and as a result 'cram' for Biotech 540 tests?" to her graduate students, and 34% answered yes. However, 62% of the class answered in affirmative to the question "Do you 'cram' for other courses that you have this semester?" Gavrin reported that 80% of the students in his JiTT class responded "yes" to "Do the JiTT exercises help you to be well prepared for lecture?" versus 21% affirmative to the same question in "other classes". He found a 58% vs. 18% split on "staying focused", a 59% vs. 18% split on "feeling like an active participant", and a 71% vs. 21% split on "finding classroom time useful".&lt;ref&gt;Gavrin, A (2010), "Using Just-in-Time Teaching in the Physical Sciences" in ''Just-in-Time Teaching: Across the Disciplines, Across the Academy'', Simkins S, and Maier M (Eds.), Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-57922-293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When trying to assess the efficacy of any pedagogical strategy, it is important to appreciate that the choice and implementation of a particular teaching method will affect student and faculty attitudes and motivation as well as learning outcomes. In her use of JiTT at [[Penn State Brandywine]], Laura Guertin has noticed strongly positive reactions from her students:

:I see my students working weekly through open-ended questions that require higher-order cognitive skills. I saw students working together in class, gaining additional practice with quantitative, communication, and management skills. I see my students using the vocabulary of the discipline as they work through JiTT exercises and discuss JiTT responses in class. I see students connecting ideas across the course and across their lives (Guertin, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Guertin, LA (2010), "Using Just-in-Time Teaching in the Geosciences" in ''Just-in-Time Teaching: Across the Disciplines'', Across the Academy, Simkins S, and Maier M (Eds.), Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-57922-293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neuropsychology}}
'''Learning''' is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, [[knowledge]], [[behavior]]s, [[skill]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, or [[preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour] 6E, Hachette UK, {{ISBN|9781444164367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some [[machine learning|machines]]; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Learning and Memory. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 31-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner | origyear=2009| year=2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including [[educational psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[experimental psychology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]], or [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]] or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|title=What behavior can we expect of octopuses? - The Cephalopod Page|author=|date=|website=www.thecephalopodpage.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135515/http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|1380861|Learned helplessness}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for human behavioral learning [[prenatal]]ly, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and [[memory]] to occur very early on in [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sandman | first1 = Wadhwa | last2 = Hetrick | first2 = Porto | last3 = Peeke | year = 1997 | title = Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1040 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1997.tb01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. [[Lev Vygotsky]] agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.

=== Non-associative learning ===
''Non-associative learning'' refers to "a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus. Changes due to such factors as [[sensory adaptation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or injury do not qualify as non-associative learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191805/http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-associative learning can be divided into [[habituation]] and [[sensitization]].

==== Habituation ====
{{Main|Habituation}}
''Habituation'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=9781317762805|location=London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''&lt;ref name="gagliano2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63–72 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sensitization ====
{{Main|Sensitization}}
''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences - From Molecule to Behavior: a university textbook|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=9783642107689|location=Heidelberg|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful. The pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Active learning ===
{{main|Active learning}}

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|[[Experiential learning]] is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|title=Hierarchy of Skills|first=|last=Igor Kokcharov, Ph.D, PMP|date=22 May 2015|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217164955/http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Active learning'' occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[(Bransford, 2000, pg.15-20)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active learning is a key characteristic of [[student-centered learning]]. Conversely, [[passive learning]] and [[direct instruction]] are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or [[traditional education]]).

The [[research]] works on the human learning process as a [[complex adaptive system]] developed by [[Peter Belohlavek]] showed that it is the concept that the individual has that drives the accommodation process to assimilate new knowledge in the [[long-term memory]], defining learning as an intrinsically freedom-oriented and active process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[student-centered learning]] approach, the unicist reflection driven learning installs adaptive knowledge objects in the mind of the learner based on a cyclic process of: “action-reflection-action” to foster an [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3161708|title= Unicist Reflection Driven Learning for Superior Education|last= Belohlavek|first=Peter|date=2018-04-12|website= |publisher=SSRN|access-date= 2018-09-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associative learning ===
''Associative learning'' is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery Series: Introduction to Psychology|last=Plotnik|first=Rod|last2=Kouyomdijan|first2=Haig|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111347024|location=Belmont, CA|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
In ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.

==== Classical conditioning ====
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
The typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="bitterman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J. Comp. Psychol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 107–119 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.97.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Vyazovskiy|first2=Vladyslav V.|last3=Borbély|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Grimonprez|first4=Mavra|last5=Depczynski|first5=Martial|date=2016-12-02|title=Learning by Association in Plants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38427|doi=10.1038/srep38427|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5133544|pmid=27910933|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623143237/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is [[John B. Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "[[Little Albert]]", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====
{{Main|Observational learning}}
''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"&gt;Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of play:
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
# role play occurs starting at the age of 3
# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# construction play involves experimentation and building
# movement play aka physical play&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"/&gt;

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url = | journal = Educational &amp; Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===
{{Main|Enculturation}}
''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.&lt;ref name="Paradise1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being "acomedido".&lt;ref name=Lopez2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Angelica|last2=Najafi|first2=Behnosh|last3=Rogoff|first3=Barbara|last4=Mejia-Arauz|first4=Rebeca|title=Collaboration and helping as cultural practices|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic learning ===
''Episodic learning'' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, W. S. (2006). Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into [[episodic memory]], which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. &amp; Gage, N. M. (2007). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience. London: Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling: ICCM - 2004|last=Lovett|first=Marsha|last2=Schunn|first2=Christian|last3=Lebiere|first3=Christian|last4=Munro|first4=Paul|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0805854268|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; or - as some describe - a timeless organization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: Critical Concepts, Volume 1|last=Chrisley|first=Ronald|last2=Begeer|first2=Sander|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0415193320|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person remembers the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience: A Beginner's Guide|last=Gage|first=Nicole|last2=Baars|first2=Bernard|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128038130|location=London|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Multimedia learning ===
{{Main|Multimedia learning}}
''Multimedia learning'' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information {{Harv|Mayer|2001}}. This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===
{{Main|Electronic learning}}
''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[minimally invasive education]].

Moore (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* learner–instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and
* learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22-38). London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===
{{Main|Rote learning}}
''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.

=== Meaningful learning ===
{{See also|Deeper Learning}}
''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal learning ===
{{Main|Informal learning}}
''Informal learning'' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.

=== Formal learning ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html " Informal Learning in the Workplace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonformal learning ===
{{Main|Nonformal learning}}
''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "[[muscle memory]]" and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning,
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=marketing_papers | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J.

''[[Extra Credits]]'' writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for "tangential learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rath,|date=2015-01-22|title=Game Criticism as Tangential Learning Facilitator: The Case of Critical Intel|url=http://gamescriticism.org/articles/rath-2-1/|journal=Journal of Games Criticism|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozelius ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozelius et al|first=|date=|title=Motivating Factors and Tangential Learning for Knowledge Acquisition in Educational Games|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1154724.pdf|journal=The Electronic Journal of E-Learning|volume= 15| issue = 4 2017|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' games are presented as an example - by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Carlos|date=|year=2014|title=Kiwaka {{!}} Kiwaka Story (by LANDKA®)|url=http://www.lifeplay.es/volumen3/Analisis/067_070_RAMIREZ_MORENO_Analisis.pdf|journal=LifePlay|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case study about the mobile game {{Wikidata entity link| Q55416666}}.

=== Dialogic learning ===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
''Dialogic learning'' is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In ''incidental teaching'' learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say “train.” Once the student says “train,” he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|pages=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains ==
[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]
[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:
* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when "... cued, primed, and guided..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–25 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3. Learning and Transfer. How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition|year=2000|publisher=The National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426234827/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|archivedate=2013-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Transfer of Learning|journal=International Encyclopedia of Education|year=1992|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Agnes L.|title=The Bearing of the New Psychology upon the Teaching of Mathematics|journal=Teacher's College Record|year=1916|volume=17|pages=344–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz, Daniel L., John D. Bransford, and David Sears|title=Efficiency and innovation in transfer: Transfer of learning from a modern multidisciplinary perspective|year=2005|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the "level of attention", "attitudes", "method of attack" (or method for tackling a problem), a "search for new points of view", "a careful testing of hypothesis" and "generalization" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.&lt;ref name="Perkins" /&gt;

== Factors affecting learning ==

=== External factors ===
# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=ESSENTIALS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 5, 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn= 9788120330559|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J.C|title=Essentials Of Educational Psychology|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn= 9788125922926|page=596|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Physical environment'': The design, quality, and setting of a [[learning space]], such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a [[learning environment]]. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

Retrieved 2016-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal factors ===
There are several internal factors that affect learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=SK|title=ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120320383|page=536|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=H.R|title=Elements Of Educational Psychology|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn= 9788125000297|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are
# ''Goals or purposes'': Each and everyone has a goal. A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.
# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.
# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.
# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks "n" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.
# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589–598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V. A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235–246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8907">'''Learning standards''' (also called '''academic standards''', '''content standards''' and '''curricula''') are elements of declarative, procedural, schematic, and strategic knowledge that, as a body, define the specific content of an educational program.  Standards are usually composed of statements that express what a student knows, can do, or is capable of performing at a certain point in their '''learning progression''' (often designated by "grade" or its equivalent).

Learning standards have multiple uses in a modern education ecosystem. They can be links to content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Browder|first1=Diane|last2=Spooner|first2=Fred|last3=Wakeman|first3=Shawnee|title=Aligning Instruction with Academic Content Standards: Finding the Link|journal=Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities|date=1 December 2006|volume=31|issue=4|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/154079690603100404?journalCode=rpsd|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can be part of a learning pathway or progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Pathway|url=http://edglossary.org/learning-pathway/|website=Glossary of Education Reform|publisher=Great Schools Partnership|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the United States==

In the United States, textbooks such as [[Noah Webster|Noah Webster's]] [[History of education in the United States|Speller]] promulgated specific knowledge to be taught to people at specific ages. Chicago superintendent William Harvey Wells expanded this approach by creating a course of instruction for Chicago Public Schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kliebard|first=Herbert M.|title=Education at the Turn of the Century: A Crucible of Curriculum Change|journal=Educational Researcher|year=1982|volume=11|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.3102/0013189x011001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he codified in "A Graded Course of Instruction for Public Schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=William Harvey|title=The Graded School: A Graded Course of Instruction for Public Schools|year=1862|publisher=G. Sherwood|location=Chicago|url=https://archive.org/details/gradedschoolagr01wellgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the first learning standards originated as a result of content in textbooks, rather than through a systematic, democratic approach. In 1892, the [[National Education Association]] convened the [[Committee of Ten]], which codified the first learning standards designed for a national high school audience. One year later, in 1893, the Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Education was formed to determine a standard number of years for elementary education, establish the content and sequence for elementary grades, and explicate a standardized course of training for elementary school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Button|first=Henry Warren|title=Committee of Fifteen|journal=History of Education Quarterly|date=December 1965|volume=5|issue=4|pages=253–263|doi=10.2307/367584|jstor=367584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Education, [[National Education Association]] of the United States|date=1895|title=Report of the Committee of Fifteen on elementary education: With the reports of the sub-committees; on the training of teachers; on the correlation of studies in elementary education; on the organization of city school systems|publisher=Pub. for the National Educational Association by the American Book Company|edition=1|oclc=2304784|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pM6gAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Committee of Fifteen's work focused primarily on defining the timing, content and teacher training for urban schools. As a result, the National Education Agency further formed the Committee of Twelve on the Rural School Problem and, in 1897, released a report intended to bring about the "...widespread consolidation of American rural schools, [to mirror] the conglomerating urban areas of the country...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Doug|title=Twenty-Five Years of Erosion in the Curriculum: The Committee of Ten to the Cardinal Principles, 1893-1918|journal=Research for Education Reform|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=41–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 20th century, the Core Knowledge Sequence developed by [[E.D. Hirsch|E. D. Hirsch]] may have contributed to cultural values espoused as learning standards and guides. The Knowledge Sequence provides a sequence for "... specific content (and skills) [to be] taught in English/language arts, history, geography, mathematics, science, and the fine arts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Core Knowledge Sequence|url=http://www.coreknowledge.org/download-the-sequence|work=Core Knowledge Foundation|publisher=Core Knowledge Foundation|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and had been adopted by some large school districts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=S. R.|title=Designing for Scaleable Educational Improvement: Processes of Inquiry in Practice|journal=In Scaling Up for Success: Lessons Learned from technology-based educational improvement, ed. C. Dede, J.P Honan, L.C. Peters|pages=67–96|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, C.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, learning standards have become an important part of the [[standards-based education reform|standards-based education reform movement]], in which learning standards are tied directly to [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] and [[Standards-based assessment|assessments]] in many schools; [[List of standardized tests in the United States|standardized tests]] are often used for grade-level evaluations within districts and states, and across states; [[High school graduation examination in the United States|standardized exams]] are used to graduate students in many US schools.

==Usage in other nations==

* In [[Germany]] the [[Kultusministerkonferenz]] (conference of ministers of education) defines, publishes and evaluates standards for different school graduation forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualitätssicherung in Schulen|url=http://www.kmk.org/dokumentation/veroeffentlichungen-beschluesse/bildung-schule/qualitaetssicherung-in-schulen.html#c7035|publisher=KMK|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Japan|Japan's]] Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan manages National Curriculum Standards. These standards define the content for classes in Mathematics, Science, Japanese language, Social Studies, Life Environment Studies, Music, Drawing and Handicraft, Physical Education and Homemaking at the Kindergarten, Elementary, Lower and Upper Secondary levels.
* [[Singapore]] utilizes syllabi to "[describe] the primary content expectations for each level through topic lists, which are similar to standards. Details are differentiated for students in different streams, or academic tracks. All students will study content through what is called the O-Level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparing the Common Core State Standards and  Singapore’s Mathematics Syllabus|url=http://www.achieve.org/files/CCSSandSingapore.pdf|publisher=Achieve, Inc|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

An example of learning standards are state-developed learning standards as described below or the [[Common Core State Standards]] (CCSS) developed by the [[National Governors Association|NGA]] and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers| Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO)]].

State learning standards are developed by [[board of education|state boards of education]] and enforced by [[State education agency|state education agencies]] across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teach-nology.com/teachers/standards/ Aggregator Site for Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning standards are also present at the local level in curriculum published by [[school district]]s where they often take the form of guidelines by grade of what a student can or should be able to do, or possibly even activity level learning objectives. These often are based on the state standards but at a finer grain.

Learning standards can also take the form of [[learning objective]]s and content-specific standards and [[controlled vocabulary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegateway.org/asn GEM]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[metadata]] about content.&lt;ref&gt;[[Learning object metadata|LOM]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are technical standards for encoding these standards that deal with K-12 learning environments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Schools Interoperability Framework|The SIF standard]]&lt;/ref&gt; which are separate from those in [[higher education]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsglobal.org/competencies/index.html Higher Ed Competency standards]&lt;/ref&gt; and private business.&lt;ref&gt;[[SCORM| SCORM - Shared Content Object Reference Model]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9879">This is a '''list of countries by 25- to 64-year-olds having completed tertiary education''' as published by the [[OECD]]. It includes some non-OECD members.

[[Tertiary education]] is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The [[World Bank]], for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tertiary Education (Higher Education)|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/0,,contentMDK:20298183~menuPK:617592~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282386,00.html#what_why|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantle of the Expert''' is an education approach that uses imaginary contexts to generate purposeful&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) A Beginner's Guide to Mantle of the Expert. Singular. p.51.(Due for publication July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and engaging&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; activities for learning. Within the fiction the students are cast as a team of experts working for a client on a commission. The commission is designed by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that fulfil the requirements of the client as well as create opportunities for students to study wide areas of the curriculum. For example, a class of students are cast (within the fiction) as a team of [[archaeologists]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] an Egyptian tomb for the [[Cairo Museum]]. To complete the commission they research ancient Egyptian history – learning about tombs, artefacts, and rituals – and in the process study history, geography, art, design and other subjects, as well as develop their skills in reading, writing, problem solving, and inquiry. Mantle of the Expert is not designed to teach the entire curriculum, all the time, but is rather an approach to be used selectively by the teacher along with a range of other methods.

Mantle of the Expert was developed by [[Dorothy Heathcote]] at [[Newcastle University]] in the 1970s and 80's. An internationally renowned authority&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, B.J. (1976) Dorothy Heathcote: Drama as a Learning Medium. London: Trentham Books.&lt;/ref&gt; on drama for learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. (2003) Dorothy Heathcote's Story: the biography of a remarkable drama teacher. London: Trentham Books, introduction p.x&lt;/ref&gt; Heathcote's aim was to provide non-drama specialists with an approach that would support them in using drama across the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt; Heathcote believed drama was an underused approach outside drama studios and could be used as a powerful medium for learning across the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Heathcote said she didn't as much invent Mantle of the Expert as "find herself doing it."&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Sandra Hesten]] in 1993, Heathcote recounts working with a small group of children on a drama context about the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] – "…thinking about it later I thought that's really important – they were expert kings. And then it began to dawn on me. People had to have a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. So when I reviewed the week I thought – the point of view of inn-keeping, the point of view of soldiers who are working for [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the point of view of [[angels]], the point of view of kings. And that's when it started coming together."&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986) The Heathcote Archive. PhD thesis. p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

This conversation is recorded by Hesten in her [[PhD thesis]] and is recounted by Heathcote at least two further times, once in the documentary "Pieces of Dorothy" and in an interview for the Mantle of the Expert website in 2009 - "That was the start, I then started to think, what do I call it? That's when I got this crazy name. Which is extreme not crazy, just fanciful. I can't find a better name." Although Heathcote doesn't put a date on the 'Nativity' context in any of these interviews, it was likely to be around the mid-1970s, since soon after this time she began talking about Mantle of the Expert as a distinct approach and incorporated it into her courses at Newcastle University.&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with her graduate students at Newcastle University, Heathcote spent much of the late 1970s and 80's researching, developing, and evaluating Mantle of the Expert across a range of settings – [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, [[Special school|special schools]], [[Borstal|borstals]], and adult and child [[mental hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.125.&lt;/ref&gt; Her method was to teach week long sessions, planned in advance with her students, which involved them playing different roles in the classroom. Although often involving a great deal of improvisation and discussion, Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert contexts were carefully planned and often elaborately embellished with resources, props, and costumes created by the graduate students. Essentially experimental in nature, these sessions were discussed, analysed, and evaluated by Heathcote and her students, and formed the foundations for the student's studies of the approach. In some cases these 'experiments' were documented.&lt;ref&gt;Hesten, S. (1986) p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring in 1987, Heathcote continued to work on Mantle of the Expert, and used the approach in various settings and in different parts of the world.

In 1995 she co-wrote, "Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education" with Gavin Bolton.&lt;ref&gt;Heathcote, D. and Bolton, G. (1995) Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education. Portsmouth: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later Developments ==

Among her students in the early 1980s was Luke Abbott. Abbott was a secondary school drama teacher at the time and took a year out to study with Heathcote on her graduate drama course. After completing his M.A. Abbott switched jobs and became a Local Authority advisor for Essex County Council and began working in schools – both primary and secondary – across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles|url=http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/about-moe/articles/|website=Mantle of the Expert|date=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this new role Abbott used Mantle of the Expert with teachers in their classrooms, using Heathcote's laboratory method. His aim was to demonstrate how Mantle of the Expert worked with students in authentic classroom settings, using few props or elaborate resources. His approach was more pragmatic than Heathcote's and designed to be easier for teachers to implement.

In the early 2000s Abbott organised a series of conferences, both nationally and internationally, to promote the approach and its use as a pedagogy. With Heathcote as the keynote speaker and classroom teachers running workshops, Abbott's aim was to demystify Mantle of the Expert and turn the approach into something non-specialist drama teachers could use across the curriculum (as Heathcote had always planned). Schools such as Bealings Primary in Suffolk, Pound Lane Infants in Sussex, and Recreation Road Infants in Norwich began to use Mantle of the Expert as their main teaching approach and gained 'outstanding' grades from [[Ofsted]], as well as excellent [[National Curriculum assessment|SATs]] results.

Since this time, Abbott and others have continued to develop Mantle of the Expert, working to train teachers in the UK, New Zealand, USA, and Palestine. Since 2012 eight schools in different regions of England have become '[http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/training/mantle-of-the-expert-quality-mark-training-schools/ training schools]' for Mantle of the Expert. And the approach is included in several university teacher training courses (including Newcastle).

== Method ==

[[File:SBP 6352.jpg|thumb|Using Heathcote's drama conventions, students explore why so many male passengers died during the sinking of the Titanic.]]
Mantle of the Expert works&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.25&lt;/ref&gt; by the teacher planning a fictional context where the students take on the responsibilities of an expert team. As the team, they are commissioned by a client (within the fiction) to work on a commission, which has been planned by the teacher to generate tasks and activities that involve them in studying and developing wide areas of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning the students are aware that they are involved in a fiction. Mantle of the Expert is not a simulation invented by the teacher to trick them into thinking they are involved in something real.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consciously going in and coming out of the fiction is an important dimension of the Mantle of the Expert approach. Like imaginative play&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; the participants are always aware that the fiction is something that can stop and start as and when they or the teacher decide. In this way, an activity inside the fiction can create a purpose for curriculum learning outside the fiction. The teacher can introduce the task to the students 'as if' they are the expert team, such as writing a report to the museum, and then stop the story and come out of the fiction to teach them directly the knowledge and skills they need to complete the task. Once the task is complete, the teacher can restart the story and the students can see how their work has an effect inside the fiction. It is this process of going in and coming out of the fictional context that defines Mantle of the Expert as a teaching and learning approach.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'mantle' in Mantle of the Expert is a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not mean the students are endowed with expertise in the real world. Heathcote was clear about this.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, C. (2015) Dorothy Heathcote on Education and Drama: Essential Writing. Routledge, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; They are only experts inside the fiction, in the sense that they are taking on the powers and responsibilities of the team; they are not experts outside the fiction. Both the teacher and the students work collaboratively inside the fiction as people working for the same team. This means the teacher deliberately changes her power relationship with the students to one of equal power and authority. In this way decisions are made through discussion and distributed leadership. Outside the fiction, the teacher's authority remains unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of a fictional context where the students experiment with making decisions, taking on responsibilities, and meeting challenging situations, is a kind of 'safe zone' within the classroom. Unlike the real world where children would rarely, if ever, have these experiences, in an imaginary world they can explore, discuss, and evaluate them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016) p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heathcote this is what she meant when she described her ideal classroom as a laboratory - "when you enter such a lab you bring in your knowledge and training with you and take on the mantle of responsibility that goes with the character of the setting. Above all, you know that the result of what you do there matter to someone other than yourself. Such settings are cells effecting change in society."&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2003) p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==

Tim Taylor in his book, "A Beginner's Guide to Mantle of the Expert"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, T. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; identifies nine elements to the Mantle of the Expert approach. These are:

# The creation of a fictional context – planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The main functions of the fictional context are to create wider opportunities for curriculum learning; to make curriculum learning meaningful and purposeful; and to engage the students in curriculum study.
# The use of a narrative – planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The main functions of the narrative are to set up the context for the students; to offer the students a way into the fiction; and to make curriculum activities memorable, understandable, and coherent.
#  The use of inquiry questions. The main functions of inquiry questions are for students to explore, study, and analyse the curriculum; for students and teachers to work together in a community of learning; and for the teacher to create opportunities for students to assess, rethink, and shape the direction of the work as it develops.
# The Expert Team. Planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. Expert teams are people with authority, power, and status; people with responsibilities and duties to others; a community with agreed values and a defined purpose; colleagues with a shared history of challenges, mistakes, and success; experts with training and experience
# The client. Planned by the teacher. The purpose of the client is to generate purposeful activities for the team; create a focus for the team; reflect back to the team how they are performing and what they need to do to improve and develop; assess and evaluate the work of the team, requiring high standards and a focus on the commission; provide information, specialist knowledge, and experiences; make demands of the team.
# The commission. Planned by the teacher and developed with the students. The function of the commission is to give purpose to the work of the team and, by extension, to the students' curriculum studies; focus the work and keep it on course; provide a goal for the work, something to strive for; create a sense of responsibility; generate self-worth and a sense of achievement.
# Different points view. The purpose of providing the students with different points of view is to look at events from multiple perspectives; provide alternative attitudes, values, and beliefs; generate opportunities for exploring people's motivations; challenge the student's views and orthodox thinking; create opportunities to explore people and events in depth and complexity; experiment with different ways of dealing with challenges and problems.
# Tension. Planned by the teacher and developed in collaboration with the students. The purpose of tension is to create excitement and interest; create productive energy, drawing on the students' excitement and commitment to events; generate opportunities to examine people's actions, motivations, and values; build resilience.
# Drama conventions. Planned by the teacher and used in collaboration with the students. The purpose of drama conventions is to play with time – hold it, rewind it, jump forward; create opportunities for exploration, examination, discussion, and reflection; investigate people's actions, motivations, and values; give students the power to influence events; create a 'safe zone' that gives students the opportunity to experiment and explore different possibilities and choices.

'''Minimally invasive education''' ('''MIE''') is a form of [[learn]]ing in which children operate in unsupervised environments. The methodology arose from an experiment done by [[Sugata Mitra]] while at [[NIIT]] in 1999, often called ''The Hole in the Wall'',&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=test /&gt; which has since gone on to become a significant project with the formation of Hole in the Wall Education Limited (HiWEL), a cooperative effort between NIIT and the [[International Finance Corporation]], employed in some 300 'learning stations', covering some 300,000 children in [[India]] and several African countries.

The programme has been feted with the digital opportunity award by [[WITSA]],&lt;ref name=test /&gt; and been extensively covered in the media.

==History==

===Background===
Professor Mitra, Chief Scientist at NIIT, is credited with proposing and initiating the Hole-in-the-Wall programme. As early as 1982, he had been toying with the idea of unsupervised learning and [[computer]]s. Finally, in 1999, he decided to test his ideas in the field.

===The experiment===
On 26 January 1999, Mitra's team carved a "hole in the wall" that separated the NIIT premises from the adjoining slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi. Through this hole, a freely accessible computer was put up for use. This computer proved to be popular among the slum children. With no prior experience, the children learned to use the computer on their own. This prompted  Mitra to propose the following hypothesis:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf PDF of Dr. Mitra's Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530050350/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper01.pdf |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of basic computing skills by any set of children can be achieved through incidental learning provided the learners are given access to a suitable computing facility, with entertaining and motivating content and some minimal (human) guidance.

In the following comment on the TED website Mitra explains how they saw to it that the computer in this experiment was accessible to children only:
:: ''"... We placed the computers 3 feet off the ground and put a shade on top, so if you are tall, you hit your head on it. Then we put a protective plastic cowl over the keyboard which had an opening such that small hands would go in. Then we put a seating rod in front that was close to the wall so that, if you are of adult height, your legs would splay when you sit. Then we painted the whole thing in bright colours and put a sign saying 'for children under 15'. Those design factors prevented adult access to a very large extent."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ted.com/profiles/136558|title=Sugata Mitra comments|date=|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
Mitra has summarised the results of his experiment as follows. Given free and public access to computers and the Internet, a group of children can
*Become computer literate on their own, that is, they can learn to use computers and the Internet for most of the tasks done by lay users.
*Teach themselves enough [[English language|English]] to use email, chat and search engines.
*Learn to search the Internet for answers to questions in a few months time.
*Improve their English [[pronunciation]] on their own.
*Improve their mathematics and science scores in school.
*Answer examination questions several years ahead of time.
*Change their social interaction skills and value systems.
*Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;http://sugatam.wikispaces.com/file/view/Method+ELSE+for+schools+where+children+teach+themselves.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status and expansion outside India==
The first adopter of the idea was the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. In 2000, the Government of Delhi set up 30 Learning Stations in a resettlement colony. This project is ongoing and said to be achieving significant results.

Encouraged by the initial success of the Kalkaji experiment, freely accessible computers were set up in Shivpuri (a town in Madhya Pradesh) and in Madantusi (a village in Uttar Pradesh).  These experiments came to be known as Hole-in-the-Wall experiments. The findings from Shivpuri and Madantusi confirmed the results of Kalkaji experiments.  It appeared that the children in these two places picked up computer skills on their own. Dr. Mitra defined this as a new way of learning "Minimally Invasive Education".

At this point in time, International Finance Corporation joined hands with NIIT to set up Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd (HiWEL). The idea was to broaden the scope of the experiments and conduct research to prove and streamline Hole-in-the-Wall. The results,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/Findings.html | title = Findings | publisher = HiWEL | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090711114940/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html | archivedate = 2009-07-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn to operate as well as play with the computer with minimum intervention. They picked up skills and tasks by constructing their own learning environment.

Today, more than 300,000 children have benefited from 300 Hole-in-the-Wall stations over last 8 years. In India Suhotra Banerjee (Head-Government Relations) has increased the reach of HiWEL learning stations in Nagaland, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh... and is slowly expanding their numbers.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt;

Besides India, HiWEL also has projects abroad.  The first such project was established in Cambodia in 2004.  The project currently operates in Botswana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zambia, besides Cambodia.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; The idea, also called [[Open learning]], is even being applied in Britain, albeit inside the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | place = UK | url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/mar/16/slumdog-millionaire-education-online-independent |title= Slumdog reveals learning treasures | first = Lucy |last=Tobin |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 March 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HiWEL==
Hole-in-the-Wall Education Ltd. (HiWEL) is a joint venture between [[NIIT]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]]. Established in 2001, HiWEL was set up to research and propagate the idea of Hole-in-the-Wall, a path-breaking learning methodology created by Mitra, Chief Scientist of NIIT.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html Official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729225909/http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
* Digital Opportunity Award by the [[World Information Technology and Services Alliance]] (WITSA) in 2008. Reason: "groundbreaking work in developing computer literacy and improving the quality of education at a grass root level."&lt;ref name=tests /&gt;

==Coverage in the media==
The project has received extensive coverage from sources as diverse as [[UNESCO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=unknown | last=unknown | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Learning from a hole in the wall | date=2007-03-16 | publisher=UNESCO | url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24266&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325201359/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24266&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-03-25 | work=UNESCO | pages= | accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Week]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Judge | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=A Lesson in Computer Literacy from India's Poorest Kids | date=2 March 2000 | publisher=The McGraw-Hill Company | url =http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2000/nf00302b.htm | work =BusinessWeek | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]], [[Reuters]],&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Pat | last=Orvis | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=A 'hole in the wall' helps educate India | date=June 1, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0601/p13s02-legn.html | work =The Christian Science Monitor | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; besides being featured at the annual TED conference in 2007.

==In school==

Minimally Invasive Education in school adduces there are many reasons why children may have difficulty learning, especially when the learning is imposed and the subject is something the student is not interested in, a frequent occurrence in modern schools. Schools also label children as "learning disabled" and place them in special education even if the child does not have a learning disability, because the schools have failed to teach the children basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Lisa. (2002), [http://reason.com/archives/2002/12/01/special-education-confidential/ "Special education confidential: how schools use the 'learning disability' label to cover up their failures,"] Reason December 1, 2002. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimally Invasive Education in school asserts there are many ways to study and learn. It argues that learning is a process you do, not a process that is done to you.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) The Sudbury Valley School Experience [http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 ''Back to Basics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511175026/http://www.sudval.com/05_underlyingideas.html#09 |date=2011-05-11 }}. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of schools holding this approach shows that [[Traditional education#Criticism of the concept of teaching in traditional education|there are many ways to learn without the intervention of teaching]], to say, without the intervention of a teacher being imperative. In the case of reading for instance in these schools some children learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Others learn from cereal boxes, others from games instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. They adduce that in their schools no one child has ever been forced, pushed, urged, cajoled, or bribed into learning how to read or write, and they have had no dyslexia. None of their graduates are real or functional illiterates, and no one who meets their older students could ever guess the age at which they first learned to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) Free at Last, The Sudbury Valley School, [https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Free+at+Last+The+Sudbury+Valley+School+The+Other+%27R%27s&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Chapter 5, ''The Other 'R's'']. Retrieved August 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar form students learn all the subjects, techniques and skills in these schools. Every person, children and youth included, has a different learning style and pace and each person, is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding. These schools assert that applying the [[Medical model|medical model of problem-solving]] to individual children who are pupils in the school system, and labeling these children as disabled—referring to a whole generation of non-standard children that have been labeled as dysfunctional, even though they suffer from nothing more than the disease of responding differently in the classroom than the average manageable student—systematically prevents the students' success and the improvement of the current educational system, thus requiring the prevention of academic failure through intervention. This, they clarify, does not refer to people who have a specific disability that affects their drives; nor is anything they say and write about education meant to apply to people who have specific mental impairments, which may need to be dealt with in special, clinical ways.

Describing current instructional methods as [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] and [[lockstep]] standardization, alternative approaches are proposed, such as the [[Sudbury model|Sudbury model schools]], an alternative approach in which children, by [[Sudbury Valley School#Educational philosophy|enjoying personal freedom]] thus [[School discipline#Discipline in Sudbury Model Democratic Schools|encouraged to exercise personal responsibility for their actions]], [[Literacy#Learning without the intervention of teaching|learn at their own pace]] rather than following a chronologically-based curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

As long as children do no harm to others, they can do whatever they want with their time in school. The adults in other schools plan a curriculum of study, teach the students the material and then test and grade their learning. The adults at Sudbury schools are ''"the guardians of the children's freedom to pursue their own interests and to learn what they wish,"'' creating and maintaining a nurturing environment, in which children feel that they are cared for, and that does not rob children of their time to explore and discover their inner selves. They also are there to answer questions and to impart specific skills or knowledge when asked to by students.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, H. (1987).

:"If learning is an emergent phenomenon, then the teacher needs to provide stimulus — lots of it – in the form of “big” questions. These must include questions to which the teacher, or perhaps anyone, does not have the answer. These should be the sorts of questions that will occupy children’s minds perpetually. The teacher needs to help each child cultivate a vision of the future. Thus, a new primary curriculum needs to teach only three skills: 1. Reading comprehension: This is perhaps the most crucial skill a child needs to acquire while growing up. 2. Information search and analysis: First articulated at the National Institute of Technology in India by professor J.R. Isaac in the early 1990s — decades ahead of its time — this skill set is vital for children searching for answers in an infinite cyberspace. 3. A rational system of belief: If children know how to search, and if they know how to read, then they must learn how to believe. Each one of us has a belief system. How soon can a child acquire one? A rational belief system will be our children’s protection against doctrine. Children who have these skills scarcely need schools as we define them today. They need a learning environment and a source of rich, big questions. Computers can give out answers, but they cannot, as of yet, make questions. Hence, the teacher’s role becomes bigger and stranger than ever before: She must ask her “learners” about things she does not know herself. Then she can stand back and watch as learning emerges."&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, S. 2012. ''Beyond the Hole in the Wall: Discover the Power of Self-Organized Learning''. TED Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first coined by [[Alfred A. Tomatis]] who used [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's music]] as the listening stimulus in his work attempting to cure a variety of disorders. The approach has been popularized in Don Campbell's book, ''The Mozart Effect'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Don|title=The Mozart Effect : tapping the power of music to heal the body, strengthen the mind, and unlock the creative spirit|date=1997|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0380974184|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted scores on one portion of the [[IQ]] test.&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rauscher | first1 = Frances H.| last2 = Shaw | first2 = Gordon L.| last3 = Ky | first3 = Catherine N.| doi = 10.1038/365611a0 | title = Music and spatial task performance | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 365 | issue = 6447 | pages = 611 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8413624| pmc = | url = http://www.uwosh.edu/psychology/faculty-and-staff/frances-rauscher-ph.d/Rauscher_ShawKy_1993.pdf/view}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|United States' Governor of Georgia]], [[Zell Miller]], proposed a budget to provide every child born in Georgia with a CD of [[classical music]].

==Alfred A. Tomatis==
The concept of the "Mozart effect" was described by French researcher [[Alfred A. Tomatis|Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis]] in his 1991 book ''Pourquoi Mozart?'' (''Why Mozart?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/Mozart.html|title=Mozart on the Brain|first=Lars|last=Sorensen|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to "retrain" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Billie M.|last2=Andrews|first2=Susan R.|title=An historical commentary on the physiological effects of music: Tomatis, Mozart and neuropsychology|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=174–188|doi=10.1007/BF02688778|pmid=11286370|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rauscher ''et al.'' 1993 study==
Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on [[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning]], and the results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]]  by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial-reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured).&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"/&gt;

==Popularization==
While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in "spatial intelligence", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, ''[[New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] wrote in a light-hearted article, "researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the world's greatest composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=CLASSICAL VIEW; Listening To Prozac . . . Er, Mozart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/classical-view-listening-to-prozac-er-mozart.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; " A 1997 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. 

The 1997 book by Don Campbell, ''The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit'', discusses the theory that listening to [[Mozart]] (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's [[IQ]] and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their [[neural development|mental development]].

After ''The Mozart Effect'', Campbell wrote a follow-up book, ''The Mozart Effect For Children'', and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance "deep rest and rejuvenation", "intelligence and learning", and "creativity and imagination". Campbell defines the term as "an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve [[memory]] or [[awareness]]. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|attention deficit disorder]], [[autism]], and other mental and physical disorders and diseases".&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Don |title=The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit |year=1997 |isbn=0-380-97418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results.

==Political impact==
The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when [[Zell Miller]], governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated "No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess." Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's "[[Ode to Joy]]" on a tape recorder and asked "Now, don't you feel smarter already?" Miller asked [[Yoel Levi]], music director of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Symphony]], to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative [[Buddy DeLoach|Homer DeLoach]] said "I asked about the possibility of including some [[Charlie Daniels]] or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |title=Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A12 |date=1998-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research and meta-analyses ==
While some supportive reports have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T., Brown, T. |title=Reexamination of the effect of Mozart's music on spatial task performance|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=131|issue=4|pages=365|doi=10.1080/00223989709603522|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thompson, W.F., Schellenberg, E.G. &amp; Husain, G. |title=Arousal, mood, and the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=248–51|pmid=11437309|year=2001|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Husain, G., Thompson, W.F. &amp; Schellenberg, E.G. |title=Effects of musical tempo and mode on arousal, mood, and spatial abilities: Re-examination of the "Mozart effect"|journal=Music Perception|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.20.2.151|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving.&lt;ref name="Ilie"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ilie, G., &amp; Thompson, W.F. |year=2011|title= Experiential and cognitive changes following seven minutes exposure to music and speech|journal= Music Perception|volume= 28|issue=3|pages= 247–264|doi=10.1525/mp.2011.28.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|doi=10.1348/026151002166433|title=Listening to Mozart does not improve children's spatial ability: Final curtains for the Mozart effect|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=241|last1 = McKelvie|first1 = Pippa|last2=Low|first2=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schellenberg, E.G., &amp; Hallam, S. |title=Music listening and cognitive abilities in 10 and 11 year olds: The Blur effect|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1060|pages=202–9|pmid=16597767|year=2005|doi=10.1196/annals.1360.013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1507375/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="bridgett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of listening to Mozart and Bach on the performance of a mathematical test|pmid=10939064|last=Bridgett |first=D.J.|author2=Cuevas, J.|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=90|issue=3 Pt 2|year=2000 |pages=1171–1175|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999  a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F.| title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 400 | issue = 6747 | pages = 826–827| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid =  10476958| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = K.

Chabris reported a  [[meta-analysis]] demonstrating that "any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation", called "enjoyment arousal". For example, he cites a study that found that "listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a [[Stephen King]] story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard". Steele et. al. found that "listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment".&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steele |first=M |title=Papers by Steele casting doubt on the Mozart effect |publisher=appstate.edu |url=http://www.acs.appstate.edu/~kms/research/Steele.htm |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords.&lt;ref name="Husain"/&gt;

Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding [[publication bias]] when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietschnig|first1=Jakob|last2=Voracek|first2=Martin|last3=Formann|first3=Anton K.|title=Mozart effect–Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=3|year=2010|pages=314–323|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|last2=Shaw|first2=Gordon L.|last3=Ky|first3=Katherine N.|title=Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=185|issue=1|year=1995|pages=44–47|pmid=7731551|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lynn E.|title=Another failure to generalize the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=87|issue=5|year=2000|pages=325–30|pmid=11026433|doi=10.2466/pr0.2000.87.1.325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Martin H.|last2=West|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Estell|first3=David B.|title=The Mozart effect: Arousal, preference, and spatial performance.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=S|issue=1|year=2006|pages=26–32|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Arousal and mood factors in the "Mozart effect"|pmid=11011888|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=91|issue=1|year=2000|pages=188–190|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms//documents/Arousal.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.91.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt; The "neural resonance" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"/&gt;

Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that "... passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Schumacher |title=Macht Mozart schlau? |url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |publisher=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |page=183 |accessdate=2009-05-22 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172239/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular presentations of the "Mozart effect", including Alex Ross's comment that "listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter" and Zell Miller's "don't you feel smarter" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to "intelligence." Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect,&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added):
{{quote|Our results on the effects of listening to ''Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K. 448'' on spatial–temporal task performance have generated much interest but several misconceptions, many of which are reflected in attempts to replicate the research. The comments by Chabris and Steele et al. echo the most common of these: that listening to Mozart enhances intelligence. ''We made no such claim.'' The effect is limited to spatial–temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering.}}

On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;ref name="rauschernyt"&gt;Goode, Erica (1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/mozart-for-baby-some-say-maybe-not.html "Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"]. ''The New York Times'', 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, "the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a "myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology |isbn=1405131128|author1=Lilienfeld, Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |author2=Lynn, Steven Jay |author3=Ruscio, John |author4=Beyerstein, Barry L. |year=2009|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Emory University]] psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book ''[[50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University of Vienna|authorlink1=University of Vienna|title=Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100510075415.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health benefits===
Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/mozart.html |title=The Mozart Effect |publisher=epilepsy.org |accessdate= 2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109052504/http://epilepsy.org.uk/info/treatment/mozart-effect|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|K.448]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)]], only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer [[Yanni]], entitled "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" (version from ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]] performed at the [[Acropolis]]'').&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt; It was determined to have the "Mozart effect", by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in [[tempo]], structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yanni in Words67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanni |author2=Rensin, David |title=Yanni in Words |publisher=[[Miramax Books]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-4013-5194-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of Mozart's music==
While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to [[seizure]] onset&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=J. R.|last2=Daaboul|first2=Y.|last3=Fino|first3=J. J.|last4=Shaw|first4=G.

J. |doi=10.1080/01616412.1998.11740543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German [[sewage treatment]] plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.  Anton Stucki, chief operator of the [[Treuenbrietzen]] plant was quoted as saying, "We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything—including the water, the sewage and the cells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Sewage plant plays Mozart to stimulate microbes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">The [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] '''''odium theologicum''''' (literally "theological hatred") is the name originally given to the often intense anger and [[hatred]] generated by disputes over [[theology]]. It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.

[[John Stuart Mill]], discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay "On Liberty" (1859) refers scornfully to the ''odium theologicum'', saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.

== Academic disputes ==
The early linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a "genuine" science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it "from the blight of the ''odium theologicum'' and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else," and he added "The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error."

Philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed "[[paradigm]]s"), and that science progresses mainly by [[paradigm shift]]s. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms.  Philosopher of math and science [[Imre Lakatos]], a student of [[Karl Popper]], described the nature of science in a similar manner.  

According to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed "research programs" (roughly equivalent to Kuhn's "paradigms").  Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist [[falsifiability|falsification]] if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence.  If this view is correct, science does not remedy ''odium theologicum'', it provides another field in which it may manifest.  

In the controversy over the validity of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]] the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] addressed his Newtonian opponent:
:You reproach me with "Calumny, detraction, and artifice". You recommend such means as are "innocent and just, rather than the criminal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents". You accuse me of the ''odium Theologicum'', the intemperate Zeal of Divines. . .&lt;ref&gt;''Defence of Free-Thinking in Mathematics'', 1735&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever view of science and the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., [[germ theory of disease]], finitude of the [[speed of light]], [[radioactivity]]) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.

'''Opportunistic collaboration''' is a flexible, emergent design for [[collaborative learning]]. In this process, groups form, break up, and recombine as part of an emerging process, with all participants aware of and helping to advance the structure of the whole. This is different from fixed, [[small group collaboration]], in which groups are often fixed for the duration of the inquiry, with a pre-specified culminating task, and a fixed stage-model of inquiry with a time-line for each stage, making clear who will do what, in what format and by when.

Opportunistic collaboration is emerging in [[knowledge organization]]s. As Chatzkel (2003) asserted, a knowledge organization “needs to nurture its people so that they feel free to move about in their organization, to group and regroup in different configurations as needed, and to rework themselves and their resources in concert with their new conditions.” (p.&amp;nbsp;20) It is a promising direction to explore this design  in educational contexts. A recent study (Zhang et al., 2006) indicated that the opportunistic collaboration model led to a high level of collective responsibility, more pervasive, flexible, distributed collaborations, and greater diffusion of information and knowledge advances.

'''Overseas Student Health Care''' is a compulsory [[health insurance]] product required by [[international student]]s studying in [[Australia]]. OSHC is an insurance product that basically gives international students a level of insurance coverage that is based on the Australian [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] system. Overseas Student Health Cover is commonly referred to as OSHC. Students can arrange to pay for their OSHC through their educational institution. However, students can still choose their own OSHC provider even when their educational institution makes a specific recommendation because they have negotiated a preferred provider arrangement with a particular insurer.

== Deed ==

OSHC is only able to be offered by Australian private health insurers who have signed the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover with the Australian government. The Deed outlines the conditions required to be met by the registered insurers in order to offer the OSHC product. A legal document between the Commonwealth of Australia and the relevant insurer, the Deed dictates the minimum benefits payable by the insurer, in addition to conditions for which it is not required to pay any benefits. 
In addition, clause 6.8 of the Deed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | title=Template Overseas Student Health Cover Deed | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20130409180938/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BB6090580215B214CA256F1900166600/$File/Template%20Overseas%20Student%20Health%20Cover%20Deed%20-%201%20July%202011.pdf | archivedate=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates the conditions under which the insurers can terminate policies and make refunds, specifically:

* Where the student decides not to come to Australia;
* Where the student has ceased studies and left Australia prior to the end of their visa;
* Where the student has had their application for an extended stay refused by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship;
* Where the student has been granted permanent residence;
* Where the student has been outside Australia for a period exceeding 3 months; or
* Where the student holds an OSHC from another insurer.

== Exceptions ==

OSHC is not needed if the student is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/stud/more/health-insurance-for-students | title=Health insurance for students | publisher=Department of Home Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a Norwegian student covered by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme
* a Swedish student covered by the [[Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency]]
* a Belgian student covered under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia.

== Providers ==

As at 30 June 2013, there were 5 health insurers who are signatories to the Australian Government the Deed for the provision of Overseas Student Health Cover enabling them to offer OSHC. These insurers are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/overseas/oshc.htm|title=Overseas Student Health Cover|first=Private Health Insurance|last=Ombudsman|website=www.privatehealth.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2692">'''Phrase completion scales''' are a type of [[psychometrics|psychometric]] scale used in [[questionnaire]]s. Developed in response to the problems associated with '''[[Likert scale]]s,''' Phrase completions are concise, unidimensional measures that tap ordinal level data in a manner that approximates interval level data. 
 
== Overview of the phrase completion method ==

Phrase completions consist of a phrase followed by an 11-point response key. The phrase introduces part of the concept. Marking a reply on the response key completes the concept. The response key represents the underlying theoretical continuum. Zero(0)indicates the absence of the construct. Ten(10)indicates the theorized maximum amount of the construct. Response keys are reversed on alternate items to mitigate response set bias.

== Sample question using the phrase completion method ==
 
'''I am aware of the presence of God or the Divine'''
   '''Never'''                                                                       '''Continually'''                                                                            
    0	    1	    2	    3	    4	    5	    6	    7	    8	    9	    10

== Scoring and analysis ==

After the questionnaire is completed the score on each item is summed together, to create a test score for the respondent. Hence, Phrase Completions, like Likert scales, are often considered to be summative scales.

== Level of measurement ==

The response categories represent an ordinal [[level of measurement]]. Ordinal level data, however, varies in terms of how closely it approximates interval level data. By using a numerical continuum as the response key instead of sentiments that reflect intensity of agreement, respondents may be able to quantify their responses in more equal units.

'''Project 985''' ({{zh|c=985工程|p= Jiǔbāwǔ gōngchéng}}) is a project that was first announced by CPC General secretary and Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]] at the 100th anniversary of Peking University on May 4, 1998, to promote the development and reputation of the [[Higher education in China|Chinese higher education system]] by founding world-class universities in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/edinburgh-global/partnerships/region/focus-china/resources-information/universities-china/project-985 Project 985,The University of Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the date of the announcement, May 1998, or 98/5 according to the Chinese [[calendar date#Date format|date format]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/cedu/ceduproject211.php |title=Project 211 and 985 |work=China Education Center Ltd. |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project involves both national and local governments allocating large amounts of funding to certain universities&lt;ref name="projectInfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/59436.htm |title=985工程 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to build new research centers, improve facilities, hold international conferences, attract world-renowned faculty and visiting scholars, and help Chinese faculty attend conferences abroad.&lt;ref name="fundingUse"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Robots and Avatars''' was a programme of events and [[education]]al activities which explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of virtual and physical life in 10–15 years time. It was produced by [[Body data space|body&gt;data&gt;space]] with support from [[National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts|NESTA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanza.co.uk/emergentcity/?p=363&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2012.

The project examined multi-identity evolutions of younger generations within the context of a world in which virtual and physical spaces are increasingly blended. A participatory web and events led programme with connected educational activities took taking place across 2010 and onwards, in the UK and internationally. The project included contributions by a diverse range of experts, professionals and specialists working with robots and avatars including Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and Professor of Public Engagement University of Sheffield), Pear Urishima (Apple), [[Ghislaine Boddington]] from body&gt;data&gt;space and [[Derek Richards]] from [[Hi8us]] South.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apengine.org/2010/06/robots-and-avatars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots and Avatars Forum==
Robots and Avatars launched in November 2009 with a Forum at NESTA, attended by an international group of 80 experts, professionals and young people in [[London]].

==Robots and Avatars Lunch Debates==
Between June and November 2010 the programme hosted a series of Lunch Debates exploring Artificial Intelligence, Behaviour and Ethics, Health and Wellbeing and the Future Workplace with expert provocateurs and top level thinkers.

==The Overall Programme==
The programme continued throughout 2010-2011 with educational events, an [[exhibition]], a [[website]], [[vodcast]]s with key experts and a book/[[DVD]].

==Themes==
Robots and Avatars explored a wide range of themes including:
* [[Robot]]s
* [[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s
* Future World of Work and Education
* [[Identity (object-oriented programming)|Identity]]
* [[Video game|Gaming]]

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence'']. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh parental discipline is associated with higher levels of aggressiveness in youth.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt; There is some evidence indicating that exposure to [[television violence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, B.

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

(1997). [http://people.biola.edu/faculty/paulp/CritiqueStraus.html ''Critique of anti-spanking study'']. Biola University.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diana Baumrind|Baumrind]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fractaldomains.com/devpsych/baumrind.htm ''Words from Diana Baumrind on corporal punishment''].

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G. (1982). ''Coercive family process''. Eugene, OR: Castalia. {{ISBN|0-916154-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1995). Coercion as a basis for early age of onset for arrest. In J. McCord (Ed.), ''Coercion and punishment in long-term perspectives'' (pp. 81–105). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.). Abusive home environments can inhibit the growth of social cognitive skills needed, for example, to understand the intentions of others.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge, Pettit"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.104.4.632 | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.

(1969). ''Causes of delinquency''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-01487-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschi's [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] data from northern California high-school students are largely consistent with this view.&lt;ref name="Hirschi"/&gt;  Findings from [[case-control study|case-control]]&lt;ref name="Sampson"&gt;Sampson, R., &amp; Laub, J. (1993). ''Crime in the making: Pathways and turning points through life''.

===Neighbourhood environment===
Neighbourhoods and communities provide the context for school violence.  Communities with high rates of crime and drug use teach youth the violent behaviors that are carried into schools.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.59.2.77 | last1 = Evans | first1 = G.

Gangs use the social environment of the school to recruit members and interact with opposing groups, with gang violence carrying over from neighbourhoods into some schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, M.E., Figlio, R.M., &amp; Sellin, T. (1987). ''Delinquency in a birth cohort''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-90553-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many children who grow up in violent neighborhoods learn to deliberately find and make "street-oriented" friends as an instrumental tactic used to avoid being victimized.&lt;ref name="Tack 224–248"/&gt; Without the threat of violence, children more commonly develop friendships based on homophily, or shared traits.

===School environment===
Recent research has linked the school environment to school violence.&lt;ref name="limbos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer-Adams | first1 = N. | last2 = Conner | first2 = B.T. | year = 2008 | title = School violence: Bullying behaviors and the psychosocial school environment in middle schools | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7200/is_200810/ai_n32297587/pg_9/ | journal = Children and Schools | volume = 30 | issue =4 | pages = 211–221 | doi=10.1093/cs/30.4.211}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teacher assaults are associated with a higher percentage male faculty, a higher proportion of male students, and a higher proportion of students receiving free or reduced cost lunch (an indicator of poverty).&lt;ref name="Casteel"/&gt; In general, a large male population, higher grade levels, a history of high levels of disciplinary problems in the school, high student to [[teacher]] ratios, and an urban location are related to violence in schools.&lt;ref name=limbos&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00341.x | last1 = Limbos | first1 = M.A.P. | last2 = Casteel | first2 = C. | year = 2008 | title = Schools and neighborhoods: Organizational and environmental factors associated with crime in secondary schools | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 78 | issue = 10| pages = 539–544 | pmid = 18808473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, E.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**The implementation of ''school-wide early-warning systems'', the school equivalent of a [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]]-like surveillance operation designed to "prevent the worst cases of school violence," has been problematic.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; Recent developments in early threat assessment, however, show promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15388220.2010.519432 | pmid = | title = Development, Evaluation, and Future Directions of the Virginia Student Threat Assessment Guidelines | year = 2011 | last1 = Cornell | first1 = Dewey | last2 = Allen | first2 = Korrie | journal = [[Journal of School Violence]] | volume = 10 | pages = 88–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence-prevention efforts can also be usefully directed at developing anti-bullying programs, helping teachers with classroom-management strategies, applying behavioral strategies such as the Good Behavior Game, implementing curricular innovations such as the Second Step syllabus, developing programs to strengthen families (see below), and implementing programs aimed at enhancing the social and academic skills of at-risk students (see below).
* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders. Thus, whether and how teachers intervene in the case of bullying is of great importance. Research has shown that teachers prefer authority-based interventions towards bullies but seem to neglect to support the victims.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015 191–202"&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Burger| first      = Christoph| last2      = Strohmeier| first2     = Dagmar| last3      = Spröber| first3     = Nina| last4      = Bauman| first4     = Sheri| last5      = Rigby| first5     = Ken| date       = 2015| title      = How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies.| url        = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004| journal    = Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51| pages      = 191–202| doi        = 10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life''''' is a 1976 book by Marxist economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis]]. Widely considered a groundbreaking work in [[sociology of education]],{{fact|date=November 2014}} it argues the "correspondence principle" explains how the internal organization of schools corresponds to the internal organisation of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] workforce in its structures, norms, and values. For example, the authors assert the hierarchy system in schools reflects the structure of the [[Labour economics|labour market]], with the head teacher as the managing director, pupils fall lower down in the hierarchy. Wearing uniforms and discipline are promoted among students from working class, as it would be in the workplace for lower levels employees. Education provides knowledge of how to interact in the workplace and gives direct preparation for entry into the labour market. 

They also believe work casts a "long shadow" in education – education is used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to control the workforce. From their point of view schools reproduce existing inequalities and they reject the notion that there are equal opportunities for all. In this way they argue that education justifies and explains social inequality.

The book is now{{when|date=November 2014}} considered the key text for the Marxist theory of sociology of education.{{fact|date=November 2014}}

==Criticisms==
Bowles and Gintis have been criticised:
* Philip Brown and Hugh Lauder (1991) argue that Bowles and Gintis have simplified the correspondence between education and the labour market. They go on further to state that there are changes in the importance of bureaucratic control in work organisations – it has reduced and there is an increased importance of team working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0962021910010102|title=Education, Economy and Social Change|last=Lauder|first=Hugh|last2=Brown|first2=Phillip|date=1991|website=|publisher=International Studies in Sociology of Education, Vol. 1|doi=10.1080/0962021910010102|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michael Apple]] (1982, 1986) examined the hidden curriculum and concludes teachers are being [[Proletarianization|proletarianised]] as the profession is de-skilled through the standardised curriculum. This increases state control over teachers and how they carry out their functions. He believes schools are sites of struggle and reproduction of inequalities persist. The formal curriculum is class biased. Reproduction of high status academic knowledge is prioritised through the schooling of those who are not poor or part of a minority. Textbooks neglect social conflict, which contribute to the ideological reproduction of capitalism.
* However Ramsey (1983) conducted a larger survey of schools and found a great deal of variation among working class schools.
* Hannan and Boyle (1987) argue the management and attitude of teachers control the ethos of a working class school, not all working class schools prepare their students for failing.
* David Reynolds (1984) – Bowles and Gintis ignore the influence of the formal curriculum. Much of the British school curriculum does not promote the development of an ideal employee under capitalism. The curriculum fails to teach skills needed by employers.
* Willis (1977) – Bowles and Gintis did not carry out detailed research into life in schools and they made assumptions that the hidden curriculum was actually influencing pupils. Many pupils had disrespect for the school rules and for the authority of the teacher. Working class "lads" learned to behave at school in ways that do not fit with capitalism's need for a passive workforce.

[[File:Fukao,Arahata,and Watanabe.JPG|thumb|alt=|Back row, from left: Shō Fukao, [[Kanson Arahata]], Masatarō Watanabe, at a welcome party for [[Keir Hardie]] ]]

'''Shō Fukao''' ({{lang|ja|深尾 韶}} ''Fukao Shō'', 12 November 1880&amp;nbsp;– 8 November 1963) was a Japanese socialist and educator.  He was a pioneer in [[Japanese socialism]] and in the early [[Boy Scout movement in Japan]].

==Life and career==

===Early life===

Fukao was born on the estate of a ''[[hatamoto]]'' samurai within [[Sunpu Castle]] (in the modern city of [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]]) on 12 November 1880.  His father Nobushirō{{efn|{{lang|ja|深尾 信四郎}} ''{{transl|ja|Fukao Nobushirō}}''}} was a retainer in [[Sunpu Domain]] who worked as a tax collector and teacher.  After graduating from elementary school, his father encouraged Fukao to go to a [[normal school]], but he declined as he disliked the duties and obligations.{{sfn|Ichihara|1977}}  As a youth he often submitted articles to arts magazines.{{sfn|Katō|1978b}}  He worked at the Shizuoka prison and Numazu local court before becoming a substitute teacher at Sodeshi Jinjō Elementary School in 1897.  He was issued a teacher's assistant's licence in 1898 and thereafter worked for seven schools in Shizuoka and the northern island-prefecture Hokkaido.{{sfn|Ichihara|1977}}

===Socialism===

In 1901, Fukao took part in the inauguration of the Shizuoka branch of the social reform group ''[[Risōdan]]''{{efn|{{lang|ja|理想団}} ''{{transl|ja|Risōdan}}''}} ("Band of Idealists").{{sfn|Ariyama|1980}}

Beginning in his time as a teacher, Fukao contributed to the weekly [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian-socialist]] newspaper ''[[Heimin Shimbun]]''.{{sfn|Katō|1978a}}  He aimed at establishing an elementary teachers' labour union in Hokkaido, but his parents demanded his return to Shizuoka in July 1904 after the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]].{{sfn|Ichihara|1977}}

In 1905, Fukao and fellow Shizuokans Masatarō Watanabe (1873–1918) and Harako Motoi (1880–1933) devised the ''Dendō Gyōshō''{{efn|{{lang|ja|伝道行商}} ''{{transl|ja|Dendō Gyōshō}}''}} to proseletize socialism.  They had planned to set out from Tokyo that April to travel around Hokkaido, but Watanabe withdrew, and on the advice of [[Kanson Arahata]] changed their destination to the closer [[Kōfu]] area.  The left the offices of Heiminsha, the publishers of ''Heimin Shimbun'', on 10 April.  On 13 April they were investigated by the local police, who took their promotional material into custody, so the pair returned to the Heiminsha offices the next day.  That May they began doing land clearing work in Hokkaido as the ''Heimin Nōjō''{{efn|{{lang|ja|平民農場}} ''{{transl|ja|Heimin Nōjō}}''}} ("Commoners' Farm").  Administrating the farm was exceedingly difficult; in August Fukao left it to Harako to manage and went back to Tokyo, never to return.  He joined the Yūbunsha,{{efn|{{lang|ja|由分社}} ''{{transl|ja|Yūbunsha}}''}} an organization made up of former members of Heiminsha after its dissolution, and took part in editing the magazine ''Katei Zasshi''.{{efn|{{lang|ja|家庭雑誌}} ''{{transl|ja|Katei Zasshi}}''}}{{sfn|Katō|1978a}}

===Scouting===

While undergoing medical treatment in the spring of 1909 Fukao obtained [[Boy Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s handbook ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', which he had learned about from an English-language newspaper.  He began researching the Scouting movement with his uncle, the editor of ''Shōnen Jihō'',{{efn|{{lang|ja|少年時報}} ''{{transl|ja|Shōnen Jihō}}'', "Boys' Newsletter"}} the results of which appeared in ''Shōnen Jihō'' that year with a call for the foundation of a "Boys' Army Corps".{{efn|{{lang|ja|少年軍団}} ''{{transl|ja|Shōnen Gundan}}''}}  They began to put such a corps together in 1910 in cooperation with Colonel [[Yoshinori Shirakawa]], who was the Infantry Regiment Commander of Shizuoka, but the plans were scuttled soon after when Shirakawa was transferred.{{sfn|Uehira|Tanaka|Nakajima|1996}}  Fukao went to Tokyo in 1910 and took the position of secretary for Shidōkai, and on the stipend he received lobbied to establish a Boy Scouts movement.  In 1912 he visited [[Nogi Maresuke]] at the [[Gakushūin]] to stress the importance of the Boy Scouts movement, and thereafter made repeated visits to Nogi.{{sfn|Ichihara|1977}}  He also visited military authorities such as [[Tanaka Giichi]] and educators such as {{illm|Yoshiharu Tadokoro|ja|田所美治}} to gain cooperation in the establishment of a boys' army corps.{{sfn|Uehira|Tanaka|Nakajima|1996}}  In 1913 he hosted meetings such as one for elementary school principals in {{illm|Shiba Ward|ja|芝区}} about the establishment of a boys' army corps, but as some questioned Fukao's personal history, the plans failed to reach fruition.{{sfnm|1a1=Uehira|1a2=Tanaka|1a3=Nakajima|1y=1996|2a1=Sukauto Undōshi Hensan Tokubetsu Iinkai|2y=1973}}

From 1914 to 1916 Fukao worked as a reporter for the ''Shizuoka Shinpō'' newspaper.  During this time, he gained the friendship of [[Yoshinori Futara]], the head of school affairs for [[Shizuoka Prefecture]].  Futara introduced Fukao to [[Motojirō Ozaki]], a member of the Diet.  The Shizuoka Shōnen Gundan{{efn|{{lang|ja|静岡少年軍団}} ''{{transl|ja|Shizuoka Shōnen Gundan}}'', "Shizuoka Boys' Army Corps"}} ("Shizuoka Boys' Army Corps") was formed in June 1913 with Ozaki as leader and Fukao and Keijirō Takasugi{{efn|{{lang|ja|高杉啓次郎}} ''{{transl|ja|Takasugi Keijirō}}''}} as directors.  111 members took part in the enrollment ceremony at [[Shizuoka Sengen Shrine|Sengen Shrine]].{{sfn|Sukauto Undōshi Hensan Tokubetsu Iinkai|1973}}  Takasugi wanted Fukao removed for his previous activity as a socialist, but Ozaki supported Fukao.{{sfn|Ichihara|1977}}

Fukao moved in 1916 to Okitsu (now part of [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]] in Shizuoka), and the Shizuoka Shōnen Gundan had to dissolve.  He returned to Shizuoka in 1918 as a reporter for the {{illm|Yorozuchōhō|ja||lt=''Yorozuchōhō''}} newspaper and formed the Shizuoka Shōnendan{{efn|{{lang|ja|静岡少年団}} ''{{transl|ja|Shizuoka Shōnendan}}'', "Shizuoka Boy Scouts"}} ("Shizuoka Boy Scouts") with Ozaki and Reiichi Okamoto.{{efn|{{lang|ja|岡本礼一}} ''{{transl|ja|Okamoto Reiichi}}''}}{{sfn|Sukauto Undōshi Hensan Tokubetsu Iinkai|1973}}

The [[Scout Association of Japan]] recognized Fukao for his contributions at an annual general meeting on 20 June 1953 and awarded him the [[Golden Pheasant Award#Awards for Japanese Scouters|Golden Eagle Award for merit]] in 1957.{{sfn|Sukauto Undōshi Hensan Tokubetsu Iinkai|1973}}

The '''Sloan Fellows''' program is the world's first mid-career [[master's degree]] in [[general management]] and [[leadership]]. It was initially supported by a grant from [[Alfred P. Sloan]], the late CEO of [[General Motors]], to his alma mater, [[MIT]]. The program was established in 1930 in [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. later, it was expanded to other leading two business schools of the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], and the [[London Business School]]&amp;nbsp;(LBS). Considered to be the most prestigious management training program, it targets experienced managers who have demonstrated success either within organizations or independently as [[entrepreneur]]s.

==History==
The Sloan Fellows Program was created at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1930, by [[Alfred P. Sloan]], Chairman of [[General Motors]] from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship as a means of developing the "ideal manager".  The Sloan Fellows Program is the world's first management and leadership education program for mid-career experienced managers.

In the following decades, the program was expanded to include the Sloan Master's at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford Sloan Master's Program|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford GSB|title=The Sloan Program at 50|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0708/feature-sloan.html|publisher=Stanford GSB|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Sloan Master's at [[London Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy.html|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1968 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Business School|title=Sloan 40th anniversary|url=http://www.london.edu/programmes/sloanmastersinleadershipandstrategy/sloan40.html?WT.mc_id=1863|publisher=London Business School|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2013 Stanford changed the name of its Sloan Fellows Program to Stanford MSx (Master of Science in Management for Experienced Leaders), though participants in the program remain Stanford Sloan Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford renames Sloan Master's Program - http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/headlines/redesigned-sloan-masters-curriculum-named-stanford-msx-program-experienced-leaders&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Sloan Fellows comprise a mix of company- and self-sponsored candidates. On all three schools, a significant degree of experience is required for admission. This is in keeping with Alfred P. Sloan's conviction that experienced managers would benefit best from the program. Alumni describe the program as "transformational", in keeping with the original vision of preparing successful managers for senior business leadership positions and increasingly, successful enterprise ventures.

The Sloan Fellows program runs full-time over the course of 12–14 months, depending on electives. [[London Business School]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT&amp;nbsp;Sloan]] offer an optional research project/thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131409/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/fellows/calendar-fulltime.php |date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan/ International Study Trip]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622050804/http://www.london.edu/sloanfellowship/Programme%20details.html |date=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program recognizes the importance of developing leadership as well as management competency in Sloan Fellows. As such, in addition to the standard MBA curriculum of management courses, the Sloan program contains a strong [[personal development|personal-development]] component designed to develop the leadership and strategic thinking capabilities of Sloan Fellows. The London Business School Sloan Masters is a specialised programme emphasising Strategy, Leadership and an intensive personal development provision.

==Admission==
Admission to [[Sloan Fellow]] Program is highly selective and goes through several steps of selection. In [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], the prospective applicant needs to first register interest in the program website and upload resume. A valid GMAT or GRE score is also required before submitting the application. After initial screening, a member of the admission committee calls the screened registered applicant  for 30 minutes discussion. Number of screened and interviewed by telephone prospective applicants will be invited to visit the program in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] for class visit, sit with current students and meet the program officers. After this stage, the applicant to submit a formal application. The received applications are again screened and the selected files will be moved to the interview stage. The invited candidates will have to participate in a formal admission interview, usually held in MIT Sloan campus, or globally in selected places. Following the interview, the decisions letters of admission or rejection will be sent to the applicants. This process is repeated three times for three rounds of application deadlines.

Following a successful shortlisting after applying, London Business School Sloan Fellows will have a personal interview with an alumnus or LBS representative.  There are four deadlines across the cycle. LBS  offers preliminary discussions,  CV reviews and class visits to support Sloan candidates’ research.

'''Student marketing''' refers to the promotion of [[Product (business)|product]]s, [[brand]]s and ideas to the 3 million+ higher and further education [[student]] population. Student marketing is generally realised through [[Student newspapers|student media]] or ambient marketing on campuses.

Student marketing is not the same as [[Student Union Marketing]] which concentrates on marketing opportunities only through Student Union, Association and Guild media. This type of media is powered through companies who provide media services for student union bodies as well as the production of their newspapers and website systems.Youth marketing companies that influence student buying behaviour and motivate student spending utilise a variety of mediums and marketing channels to effectively talk to the youth.

Marketing material directed at students must overcome several problems: they have little money; they are a transient population who will soon graduate, cease to be students, and possibly move away; and they tend to be a skeptical audience critical towards marketing messages and fake attempts to be cool.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Geoff|title=Five Tips for Marketing to College Students|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217344|work=Entrepreneur|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However students are also an attractive market: while they do have a restricted budget many are living away from home and are therefore making independent choices over which brands to buy for the very first time. Hence they are often excited about making purchases that would be mundane for older consumers.&lt;ref name=williams/&gt; Attracting students at this time has huge long run brand loyalty effects. [[University student]]s also make an ideal target market for internet-based companies. Over 99% of students are comfortable using the [[internet]], going online at least once a week, although usually every day.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} They also don’t have the same fear of the [[internet]] as much of the general population, particularly when it comes to [[Online shopping|purchasing goods online]] – average online spend is 7 times higher than that of the general population.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Finally, whilst the working population uses the internet predominantly for work purposes, two-thirds of the time that students spend online is general [[Web surfing|surfing]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

When it comes to targeting, students have in the past been considered an elusive group, with much of their time taken up on campus and through [[socialising]]. Traditional forms of advertising, such as mainstream radio, [[TV]] and [[billboard|billboard advertising]] campaigns, are not ideal channels for reaching today’s students. Therefore, other media are targeted, such as smartphone advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of Mobile in Student Marketing|url=http://edu.3dissue.com/mobile-student-marketing/|work=3D Issue|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=Aug 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fallon|first=Nicole|title=3 Social Media Tips for Marketing to College Students|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5099-college-social-media-marketing.html|work=Business News Daily|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, marketers can take advantage of students' concentration at geographical locations (colleges) and use techniques such as campus visits and college street teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Rosie|title=Wagamama targets students with experiential campaign|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/wagamama-targets-students-with-experiential-campaign/3024204.article|work=Marketing Week|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=8 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorel|first=Marc|title=The Key to Advertising to Students is Knowing Your Target Audience|url=http://www.collegemarketing.net/the-key-to-advertising-to-students-is-knowing-your-target-audience/|work=College Marketing Insider|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the UK==
Students in the UK are estimated to spend over £13 billion a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventive Strategies to Win Over the Student Market|url=http://www.brandrepublicinsight.com/inventive-strategies-to-win-over-the-student-market|work=Brand Republic|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them a key market for consumer brands.

With the growth and development of the internet, campaigns have vastly diversified and now include multiple elements from traditional on-campus activity to bluetooth, Adwalkers, email, sms, online and social media. Leading youth brands such as the BBC, Burger King, O2, Red Bull, Virgin, to name a few, are actively engaging with the UK student market through agencies and media channels who produce the official universities welcome parcels directly into the student bedrooms.

A leading factor in the diversification of the market has been the rapid growth in the size of the student market in the UK over recent years, with 1.8 million students now in Higher Education Programmes. 
 
With a combined spending power of more than £10 billion and an average student spending over £5,000 each year the student market can be a highly lucrative one. Students are certainly the most profitable group of 18- to 24-year-olds.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Some UK universities have moved to ban advertising they consider harmful to students, such as for [[payday loan]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clements|first=Lana|title=Universities move to ban payday ‘sharks’ from advertising to student ‘prey’|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/universities-ban-payday-sharks-from-advertising-to-students-115324486.html|work=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=Jun 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Rhoda|title=Ban payday lenders from campus advertising, say students|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/borrowing/article3787057.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the USA==
Certain agencies have focused on advertising to college students, such as Student Advantage, which operated a membership-card based program in the 1990s and moved into the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|title=A major force in marketing to college students steps up its activities on the Internet.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/13/business/media-business-advertising-major-force-marketing-college-students-steps-up-its.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which in 1998 bought rival Collegiate Advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Sarah|title=Student Marketing Firms Team Up|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/student-marketing-firms-team-40495|work=AdWeek|accessdate=25 September 2013|date=March 30, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[StudentUniverse]] offers students discounts on various products.

The art and science of collecting and managing [[Submission (Electronic)|submissions]] (of any kind) is called Submission Management. Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of [[Internet]] in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, [[Word document|word]] and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.

Managing submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.

==Common scenarios==
===Academics===
It is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get [[Assignment (education)|assignments]] and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given [[Feedback#In_education|feedback]] on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a [[Learning management system|system]] (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.

===Call-for-paper (academic) conferences===
In call-for-paper or [[academic conference]]s, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the conference's [[program committee]] and/or external reviewers chosen by them.

===Competitions and contests===
Most [[competition]]s and [[Competition|contest]]s held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the [[nomination]]s and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.

===College events and fests===
[[Student groups|Student bodies]] in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or [[semester]] basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.

===Pharmaceuticals industry===
Regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.

===Human resources===
[[Human resources|Human resource]] departments collect [[résumé]]s and [[Curriculum vitae|CVs]] as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on [[employment websites]] that help connect job seekers and employers.

===Contemporary art===
In [[contemporary art]], curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===The fashion industry===
[[Model (person)|Models]] create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Publication and media houses===
Journalists and writers (full-time as well as [[freelancer]]s) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.

===Government applications===
Most government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.

==Challenges==
===Submission standards and formats===
As companies, agencies and institutes move towards [[electronic submission]]s, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.

One example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the [[electronic Common Technical Document]] (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).&lt;ref name="ICH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|title=The ICH eCTD Specification V 3.2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916072404/http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inappropriate modes and lack of automated systems===
Email is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.

The key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert [[reviewer]]s or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Submission management systems==
Certain software vendors have begun developing [[submission management system]]s to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are [[web based]] and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">'''TIME-ITEM''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of ''Topics'' that describes the content of undergraduate [[medical education]].  TIME is an acronym for "Topics for Indexing Medical Education"; ITEM is an acronym for "Index de thèmes pour l’éducation médicale."  Version 1.0 of the taxonomy has been released and the [[web application]] that allows users to work with it is still under development.  Its developers are seeking more collaborators to expand and validate the taxonomy and to guide future development of the web application.

== History ==

The development of TIME-ITEM began at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 2006.  It was initially developed to act as a content [[Index (publishing)|index]] for a [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum map]] being constructed there.  After its initial presentation at the 2006 conference of the [http://www.came-acem.ca/ Canadian Association for Medical Education],&lt;ref&gt;Willett T &amp; Clarke M. A Map of Medical Concepts: A General-use Database for Applications in Medical Education.  AFMC Resource Group on Medical Informatics Reception.  At the Canadian Association for Medical Education Conference (May 2006) London, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; early collaborators included the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McMaster University]] and [[Queen's University]].

== Features ==

The TIME-ITEM ontology is unique in that it is designed specifically for undergraduate medical education.  As such, it includes fewer strictly biomedical entries than other common medical [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabularies]] (such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] or [[SNOMED CT]]) but more entries relating to the medico-social concepts of communication, collaboration, professionalism, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willett | first1 = TG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = KC. | last3 = Broudo | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = M. | title = It's about TIME: a general-purpose taxonomy of subjects in medical education | journal = Med Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–8 |date=Apr 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03012.x | pmid = 18298447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics within TIME-ITEM are arranged poly-[[Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchically]], meaning any Topic can have more than one [[Tree (data structure)|parent]].  Relationships are established based on the logic that learning about a Topic contributes to the learning of all its parent Topics. 

In addition to housing the ontology of Topics, the TIME-ITEM web application can house multiple [[Curriculum framework|Outcome frameworks]].  All [[Outcome-based education|Outcomes]], whether private Outcomes entered by single institutions or publicly available medical education Outcomes (such as [[CanMeds 2005]]) are hierarchically linked to one or more Topics in the ontology.  In this way, the contribution of each Topic to multiple Outcomes is made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Willett TG, Marshall KC, Broudo M &amp; Clarke M.  TIME as a generic index for outcome-based medical education.  ''Medical Teacher'' 2008; 29(7):655-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the [[XML]] documents exported from TIME-ITEM (which contain the hierarchy of Outcomes and TIME-ITEM Topics) is being developed alongside the [http://www.medbiq.org MedBiquitous] Competency standards.  

The taxonomy currently exists in English only but translation to Canadian French is in progress.

== Applications ==

TIME-ITEM is intended to be a general-use ontology for medical [[Education Informatics|education informatics]].  It has two primary potential applications:
# Inclusion in [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum maps]].  By mapping learning objects or sessions to TIME-ITEM Topics in a curriculum map, the map becomes searchable for both granular and broad concepts.  If one or more Outcome frameworks are included with the Topic ontology, then the contribution of each curricular element to one or more Outcomes is made explicit.  This also facilitates curriculum [[evaluation]] in terms of one or more outcome frameworks.
# Indexing learning, assessment and portfolio objects.  Metatagging [[learning object]]s or [[assessment objects]] with a controlled vocabulary enhances the organization and retrieval of objects from a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]].  Metatagging [[electronic portfolio]] entries allows one to show how multiple entries "add up" to a demonstration of competence with respect to certain educational outcomes.

The possibility of expanding or modifying TIME-ITEM for use in postgraduate/continuing medical education and in nursing education is currently being explored.

A '''trainee''' is commonly known as an individual taking part in a [[trainee program]] or a [[graduate program]] within a company after having graduated from [[university]] or [[college]].  

A trainee is an official employee of the firm that is being trained to the job he/she was originally hired for. Literally an employee in training. Trainee programs and graduate programs are arranged by private companies and public sector employers where the trainee is offered the possibility to take part 6 to 20 months training programs. During the duration of these programs the trainee is expected to receive a salary as well as is expected to have a full-time employment awaiting in the company when the program is over. Often used as an insurance measure by companies, firms typically will have a trainee period (2–3 months) where the person is still being evaluated after which an official decision to hire on a permanent basis is made.

The trainee programs most often consist of a combination of theory and practice and is aimed at having the trainee to learn the company from the ground up. Many trainees are able to take advantage of their contact network from the trainee program and climb the corporate ladder and become key individuals in many companies. 

Many companies around the world organise trainee programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">A '''virtual internship''' is a work experience program where the participant ([[intern]]) gains experience while working in a remote professional setting and is not physically present at the job location.

Virtual interns communicate with their employer online through various means including email, [[Skype]],  [[Whatsapp]], instant messaging, phone conversations, [[webinars]], project management tools, [[SMS]] (text) messaging, etc.

Virtual internships are undertaken by both students and graduates.  The most common virtual internships are in the following areas:
Information technology; Software development; Marketing; Social Media; Research; Writing; Journalism; Media; Pre and post event planning; Video creation and editing; Human Resources; Graphic Design; Search Engine Optimization and Marketing; Some non-profits and government internships; Some political internships; Some engineering internships; and Some public relations internships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Dreama|title=President|url=http://www.internprofits.com/virtualinternshipwhitepaper/|work=(888) 291-9098|publisher=Efficient Enterprises, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West African Academy of Public Health ]] operates a virtual internship programme with mentoring cascade for recent graduates interested in working in [[Global Health]] The "WAAPH VIP" as it is called,  engages youths in health information advocacy to expand  their health information literacy, core leadership skills and community engagement capacity to work in public health issues.  [http://www.ngscholars.net/west-african-academy-public-health-internship-application/]

According to career experts, although virtual internships are currently rare, they are growing in popularity due to improving technology and the growth of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marte|first=Jonnelle|title=An Internship From Your Couch|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704471504574441132945681314|accessdate=17 February 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rise has been reported in virtual internships —most of which are unpaid— especially from small ventures and start ups seeking additional help. Larger companies are also starting to explore offering these types of internships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Damast|first=Alison|title=Virtual Internships In Rising Demand|url=http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/virtual-internships-in-rising-demand-01182012.html|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They are presently most popular among small to midsize companies and online businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Braathe|first=Robert|title=Internships|url=http://www.braatheenterprises.com/education/internships/|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Department of State]] operates the Virtual Student Foreign Service program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Student Foreign Service|url=https://www.state.gov/vsfs|work=The U.S. Department of State|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As of 2012, 343 eInterns have worked with US diplomatic posts in 97 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alec|title=Keynote Address: Alec Ross, US State Dept|url=http://new.livestream.com/smwnychange/TeamObamaTalksDigitalVision|work=Social Media Week NYC|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual internships have been criticized for not providing the supervision and guidance that internships are meant to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/blog/unpaid-interns-bank-on-skills-not-money}}&lt;/ref&gt;
