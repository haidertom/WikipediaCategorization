      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60811">'''Artificial general intelligence''' ('''AGI''') is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a [[human]] being can. It is a primary goal of some [[artificial intelligence]] research and a common topic in [[science fiction]] and [[Futures studies|future studies]]. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as "'''strong AI'''",&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] where he defines strong AI as "machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt; "'''full AI'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Age-of-Artificial-Intellige The Age of Artificial Intelligence: George John at TEDxLondonBusinessSchool 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; or as the ability of a machine to perform "general intelligent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}}. This is the term they use for "human-level" intelligence in the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic sources reserve "strong AI" to refer to machines capable of experiencing [[Chinese room#Strong AI|consciousness]].

Some references emphasize a distinction between strong AI and "applied AI"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219086/artificial-intelligence Strong AI, applied AI, and cognitive simulation] or Jack Copeland [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/www.AlanTuring.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/what_is_AI/What%20is%20AI02.html What is artificial intelligence?] on AlanTuring.net&lt;/ref&gt; (also called "narrow AI"&lt;ref name=K/&gt; or "[[weak AI]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/nextbigthing/ai/ai_in_depth/in_depth.htm The Open University on Strong and Weak AI]&lt;/ref&gt;): the use of software to study or accomplish specific [[problem solving]] or [[reason]]ing tasks. Weak AI, in contrast to strong AI, does not attempt to perform the full range of human [[cognitive]] abilities.

As of 2017, over forty organizations worldwide are doing active research on AGI.&lt;ref name=baum/&gt;

==Requirements==
{{main|Cognitive science}}

Various criteria for [[intelligence]] have been proposed (most famously the [[Turing test]]) but to date, there is no definition that satisfies everyone.&lt;ref&gt;AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes: "we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent." {{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html |title=Basic Questions| last=McCarthy |first=John| authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist)| publisher=[[Stanford University]]| year=2007}} (For a discussion of some definitions of intelligence used by [[artificial intelligence]] researchers, see [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there ''is'' wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;
This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by major AI textbooks, including:
{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
{{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}},
{{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and
{{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[automated reasoning|reason]], use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under [[uncertainty]];
* [[knowledge representation|represent knowledge]], including [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]];
* [[automated planning and scheduling|plan]];
* [[machine learning|learn]];
* communicate in [[natural language processing|natural language]];
* and integrate all these skills towards common goals.

Other important capabilities include the ability to [[machine perception|sense]] (e.g. [[computer vision|see]]) and the ability to act (e.g. [[robotics|move and manipulate objects]]) in the world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, R. and Bongard J. C., How the body shapes the way we think: a new view of intelligence (The MIT Press, 2007). {{ISBN|0-262-16239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include an ability to detect and respond to [[hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = R. W. | year = 1959 | title = Motivation reconsidered: The concept of competence | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 66 | issue = 5| pages = 297–333 | doi=10.1037/h0040934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many interdisciplinary approaches to intelligence (e.g. [[cognitive science]], [[computational intelligence]] and [[decision making]]) tend to emphasise the need to consider additional traits such as [[imagination]] (taken as the ability to form mental images and concepts that were not programmed in)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Self-determination theory|autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;deCharms, R. (1968). Personal causation. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Computer based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities do exist (e.g. see [[computational creativity]], [[automated reasoning]], [[decision support system]], [[robot]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[intelligent agent]]), but not yet at human levels.

===Tests for confirming human-level AGI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|title=What is AGI?|url=http://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/|publisher=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
;[[Turing test|The Turing Test]] ([[Alan Turing|''Turing'']])
: A machine and a human both converse sight unseen with a second human, who must evaluate which of the two is the machine, which passes the test if it can fool the evaluator a significant fraction of the time. Note: Turing does not prescribe what should qualify as intelligence, only that knowing that it is a machine should not disqualify it.
;The Coffee Test ([[Steve Wozniak|''Wozniak'']])
: A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons.
;The Robot College Student Test ([[Ben Goertzel|''Goertzel'']])
: A machine enrolls in a university, taking and passing the same classes that humans would, and obtaining a degree.
;The Employment Test ([[Nils John Nilsson|''Nilsson'']])
: A machine works an economically important job, performing at least as well as humans in the same job.
;The flat pack furniture test (''Tony Severyns'')
:A machine is required to unpack and assemble an item of flat-packed furniture. It has to read the instructions and assemble the item as described, correctly installing all fixtures.

== Problems requiring AGI to solve ==
{{Main|AI-complete}}

The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as "AI-complete" or "AI-hard", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness. In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3–17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to repel [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security]. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294–311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Bergmair | title = Natural Language Steganography and an "AI-complete" Security Primitive | citeseerx = 10.1.1.105.129 | date = January 7, 2006 }} (unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical AI ==
{{Main|History of artificial intelligence}}
Modern AI research began in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of AI researchers was convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. As AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their predictions were the inspiration for [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s character [[HAL 9000]], who accurately embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. Of note is the fact that AI pioneer [[Marvin Minsky]] was a consultant&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two1.html Scientist on the Set: An Interview with Marvin Minsky]&lt;/ref&gt; on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time; Crevier quotes him as having said on the subject in 1967, "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved,"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky to {{Harvtxt|Darrach|1970}}, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Minsky states that he was misquoted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful "applied AI".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Lighthill report]] specifically criticized AI's "grandiose objectives" and led the dismantling of AI research in England. ({{Harvnb|Lighthill|1973}}; {{Harvnb|Howe|1994}}) In the U.S., [[DARPA]] became determined to fund only "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". See {{Harv|NRC|1999}} under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment". See also {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=115–117}} and {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1980s began, Japan's [[Fifth Generation Computer]] Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like "carry on a casual conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=211}}, {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=24}} and see also {{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|McCorduck|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and the success of [[expert systems]], both industry and government pumped money back into the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier| 1993|pp=161–162,197–203,240}}; {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}; {{harvnb|NRC|1999|loc=under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who had predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been shown to be fundamentally mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had gained a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all&lt;ref&gt;As AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes "it would be a great relief to the rest of the workers in AI if the inventors of new general formalisms would express their hopes in a more guarded form than has sometimes been the case." {{cite web| url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/reviews/lighthill/lighthill.html | title=Reply to Lighthill | last=McCarthy | first=John | authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) | publisher=Stanford University |year=2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid any mention of "human level" artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled "wild-eyed dreamer[s]."&lt;ref&gt;"At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |title=Behind Artificial Intelligence, a Squadron of Bright Real People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/14/technology/14artificial.html?ei=5070&amp;en=11ab55edb7cead5e&amp;ex=1185940800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1185805173-o7WsfW7qaP0x5/NUs1cQCQ |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current narrow AI research==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}

In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved far greater commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as [[artificial neural networks]], [[computer vision]] or [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "applied AI" systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is very heavily funded in both academia and industry.

Most mainstream AI researchers hope that strong AI can be developed by combining the programs that solve various sub-problems using an integrated [[agent architecture]], [[cognitive architecture]] or [[subsumption architecture]]. [[Hans Moravec]] wrote in 1988: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]] that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical [[golden spike]] is driven uniting the two efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even this fundamental philosophy has been disputed; for example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton concluded his 1990 paper on the [[Symbol grounding problem|Symbol Grounding Hypothesis]] by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The expectation has often been voiced that "top-down" (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet "bottom-up" (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Artificial general intelligence research==
Artificial general intelligence{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} (AGI) describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action. The term was introduced by Mark Gubrud in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.  The research objective is much older, for example [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]] project (that began in 1984), and [[Allen Newell]]'s [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] project are regarded as within the scope of AGI. AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and [[Ben Goertzel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goertzel|Wang|2006}}. See also {{harvtxt|Wang|2006}} with an up-to-date summary and lots of links.&lt;/ref&gt; as "producing publications and preliminary results". As yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

==Processing power needed to simulate a brain ==

===Whole brain emulation===
{{main|Mind uploading}}
A popular approach discussed to achieving general intelligent action is [[whole brain emulation]]. A low-level brain model is built by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer runs a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;
{{Harvnb|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}. "The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain."&lt;/ref&gt; Whole brain emulation is discussed in [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]], in the context of [[brain simulation]] for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.

===Early estimates ===
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; computations per second (cps).&lt;ref&gt;In "Mind Children" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cps is used. More recently, in 1997, &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&gt; Moravec argued for 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not "cps", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, if a "computation" was equivalent to one "[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]" –  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s – then 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; "computations" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.

===Modelling the neurons in more detail===
The [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently only understood in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Discover2011JanFeb"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia—the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan–Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current research===
There are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures. The [[Artificial Intelligence System]] project implemented non-real time simulations of a "brain" (with 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) in 2005. It took 50 days on a cluster of 27 processors to simulate 1 second of a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izhikevich |first=Eugene M. |last2=Edelman |first2=Gerald M. |date=March 4, 2008 |title=Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |journal=PNAS |publisher= |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=3593–3598 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0712231105|access-date=23 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612095651/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2009 |pmid=18292226 |pmc=2265160|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3593I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Brain]] project used one of the fastest supercomputer architectures in the world, [[IBM]]'s [[Blue Gene]] platform, to create a real time simulation of a single rat [[Neocortex|neocortical column]] consisting of approximately 10,000 neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer term goal is to build a detailed, functional simulation of the physiological processes in the human brain: "It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years," [[Henry Markram]], director of the Blue Brain Project said in 2009 at the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away' 2009 BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been controversial claims to have simulated a [[cat intelligence#Computer simulation of the cat brain|cat brain]]. Neuro-silicon interfaces have been proposed as an alternative implementation strategy that may scale better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/10343 University of Calgary news], [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12037941/ MSNBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Moravec]] addressed the above arguments ("brains are more complicated", "neurons have to be modeled in more detail") in his 1997 paper "When will computer hardware match the human brain?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He measured the ability of existing software to simulate the functionality of neural tissue, specifically the retina.  His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.

===Complications and criticisms of AI approaches based on simulation===
A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree&lt;/ref&gt; If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like [[Second Life]]), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.

Desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit "computations per second", see above) have been available since 2005. According to the brain power estimates used by Kurzweil (and Moravec), this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain, but despite some interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setiai.com/archives/cat_honey_bee_brain.html some links to bee brain studies]&lt;/ref&gt; no such simulation exists {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. There are at least three reasons for this:
* Firstly, the neuron model seems to be oversimplified (see next section).
* Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes{{refn|In Goertzels' AGI book ([[#CITEREFYudkowsky2006|Yudkowsky 2006]]), Yudkowsky proposes 5 levels of organisation that must be understood – code/data, sensory modality, concept &amp; category, thought, and deliberation (consciousness) – in order to use the available hardware}} to establish accurately what the brain's neural activity, observed using techniques such as [[Neuroimaging#Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging]], correlates with.
* Thirdly, even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently, early simulation programs are likely to be very inefficient and will, therefore, need considerably more hardware.
* Fourthly, the brain of an organism, while critical, may not be an appropriate boundary for a cognitive model.  To simulate a bee brain, it may be necessary to simulate the body, and the environment. [[The Extended Mind]] thesis formalizes the philosophical concept, and research into [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]] has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralized system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15829594 | doi=10.1152/jn.00684.2004 | volume=94 | issue=2 | title=Dynamic model of the octopus arm.

In addition, the scale of the human brain is not currently well-constrained. One estimate puts the human brain at about 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|Herrup|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-75525 "nervous system, human."] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 9 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate is 86 billion neurons of which 16.3 billion are in the [[cerebral cortex]] and 69 billion in the [[cerebellum]].{{sfn|Azevedo et al.|2009}} [[Glial cell]] synapses are currently unquantified but are known to be extremely numerous.

==Artificial consciousness research==
{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}

Although the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].

==Relationship to "strong AI"==
{{See also|philosophy of artificial intelligence|Chinese room}}

In 1980, philosopher [[John Searle]] coined the term "strong AI" as part of his [[Chinese room]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence:&lt;ref&gt;As defined in a standard AI textbook: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis." {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An artificial intelligence system can ''think'' and have a ''mind''.  (The word "mind" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in "the [[mind body problem]]" or "the [[philosophy of mind]]".)
* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.
The first one is called "the ''strong'' AI hypothesis" and the second is "the ''weak'' AI hypothesis" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the "strong AI hypothesis" as "strong AI". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;For example:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] (quoted in "High Beam Encyclopedia"),
* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] (quoted in "AITopics")
* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math]
* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] Anthony Tongen
&lt;/ref&gt;

The weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}

In contrast to Searle, Kurzweil uses the term "strong AI" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,&lt;ref name=K/&gt; regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.

==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==
{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}

Since the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

While most AI researchers believe that strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] that deny the possibility of achieving AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}

Conceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: "the framework starts from Weizenbaum’s observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

Furthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do {{Examples|date=September 2017}}.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem that is described by David Gelernter is that some people assume that thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}

The problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Other possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Clocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}

The practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}

A possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.

There have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, "No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion."{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.

==Consciousness==
There are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:
* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it "feels like" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask "what does it feel like to be a bat?" However, we are unlikely to ask "what does it feel like to be a toaster?" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.
* [[sentience]]: The ability to "feel" perceptions or emotions subjectively.
* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.
These traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. Also, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | magazine=Wired |date=April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.

In science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to philosopher [[John Searle]], it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. "Strong AI" (as defined above by [[Ray Kurzweil]]) should not be confused with Searle's "'[[strong AI hypothesis]]". The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.

==Controversies and dangers==

===Feasibility===
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". However, this prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require "unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs" and a "scientifically deep understanding of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Paul|title=The Singularity Isn't Near|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[The Guardian]], roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI experts' views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when they'd be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. It is also interesting to note 16.5% of the experts answered with "never" when asked the same question but with a 90% confidence instead.&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raffi Khatchadourian|title=The Doomsday Invention: Will artificial intelligence bring us utopia or destruction?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V.

===Potential threat to human existence{{anchor|Risk_of_human_extinction}}===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{See also|Technological singularity}}

The creation of artificial general intelligence may have repercussions so great and so complex that it may not be possible to forecast what will come afterwards.  Thus the event in the hypothetical future of achieving strong AI is called the [[technological singularity]], because theoretically one cannot see past it.  But this has not stopped philosophers and researchers from guessing what the smart computers or robots of the future may do, including forming a utopia by [[friendly artificial intelligence|being our friends]] or overwhelming us in an [[AI takeover]]. The latter potentiality is particularly disturbing as it poses an [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk for mankind]].

==== Self-replicating machines ====
Smart computers or robots would be able to design and produce improved versions of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Hein, Andreas Makoto, and Hélène Condat. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02091 "Can Machines Design? An Artificial General Intelligence Approach."] arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02091 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; A growing population of intelligent robots could conceivably out-compete inferior humans in job markets, in business, in science, in politics (pursuing [[robot rights]]), and technologically, sociologically ([[Group mind (science fiction)|by acting as one]]), and militarily.

==== Emergent superintelligence ====
If research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself – a feature called "recursive self-improvement". It would then be even better at improving itself, and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to an [[intelligence explosion]] and the emergence of [[superintelligence]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and might be able to invent or discover almost anything.

Hyper-intelligent software might not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and might be extremely difficult to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Yudkowsky, Eliezer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of [[risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth]].

One proposal to deal with this is to make sure that the first generally intelligent AI is a [[friendly AI]] that would then endeavor to ensure that subsequently developed AIs were also nice to us. But friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI, and therefore it is likely, in a race between the two, that non-friendly AI would be developed first. Also, there is no guarantee that friendly AI would remain friendly, or that its progeny would also all be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B2MML''' or '''Business To Manufacturing Markup Language''' is an XML implementation of the ANSI/[[Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society|ISA]]-95 family of standards ([[ISA-95]]), known internationally as IEC/ISO 62264. B2MML consists of a set of [[XML]] schemas written using the [[World Wide Web Consortium]]'s [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] language (XSD) that implement the data models in the ISA-95 standard.

B2MML is meant to be a common data definition to link [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] and supply chain management systems with manufacturing systems such as [[Industrial Control Systems]] and [[Manufacturing Execution Systems]].

B2MML is published by the [[Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association]] (MESA).

The '''ball and beam''' system consists of a long beam which can be tilted by a servo or electric motor together with a ball
rolling back and forth on top of the beam.
It is a popular textbook example in [[control theory]].

The significance of the ball and beam system is that it is a simple system which is open-loop [[BIBO stability|unstable]].
Even if the beam is restricted to be very nearly horizontal, without active [[feedback]], it will swing to one side or the
other, and the ball will roll off the end of the beam.  To stabilize the ball, a [[controller (control theory)|control system]] which
measures the position of the ball and adjusts the beam accordingly must be used.

In two dimensions, the ball and beam system becomes the '''ball and plate''' system, where a ball rolls on top of
a plate whose inclination can be adjusted by tilting it frontwards, backwards, leftwards, or rightwards.

Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "[[Spaceship Earth]]", "[[Dymaxion]]" house/car, [[ephemeralization]], [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetic]], and "[[tensegrity]]". He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known [[geodesic dome]]. Carbon molecules known as [[fullerene]]s were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.

Fuller was the second World President of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] from 1974 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mensa: The Society for the Highly Intelligent |pages=299, 304 |first=Victor |last=Serebriakoff |publisher=Stein and Day |year=1986 |isbn=0-8128-3091-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of [[Margaret Fuller]], an American journalist, critic, and [[women's rights]] advocate associated with the American [[transcendentalism]] movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work|last=Sieden|first=Steven|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=0738203793|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller spent much of his youth on [[Bear Island (Maine)|Bear Island]], in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine. He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term "invention".

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.&lt;ref name=pawley&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=0-8008-1116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Fuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [[vaudeville]] troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his "irresponsibility and lack of interest." By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt;

===Wartime experience===
Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile [[factory|mill]], and later as a laborer in the [[meat-packing]] industry. He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a [[crash rescue boat]] commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt; in 1927.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p84-85"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden |title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work |location=New York |publisher=[[Perseus Books Group]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |pages=84–85 |quote=However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company. Within weeks Stockade Building Systems became a subsidiary of Celotex Corporation, whose primary motivation was akin to that of other conventional companies: making a profit. Celotex management took one look at Stockade's financial records and called for a complete overhaul of the company. The first casualty of the transition was Stockade's controversial president [Buckminster Fuller, who was fired].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression and epiphany===
Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from [[polio]] and [[spinal meningitis]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. Buckminster, ''Your Private Sky'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt; just before her fourth birthday.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller dwelled on her death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt; This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt;

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p87"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |page=87 |quote= ... during 1927, Bucky found himself unemployed with a new daughter to support as winter was approaching. With no steady income the Fuller family was living beyond its means and falling further and further into debt. Searching for solace and escape, Bucky continued drinking and carousing. He also tended to wander aimlessly through the Chicago streets pondering his situation. It was during one such walk that he ventured down to the shore of Lake Michigan on a particularly cold autumn evening and seriously contemplated swimming out until he was exhausted and ending his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

{{quote|From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.&lt;ref name="Sieden-p87-88"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 |pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/automobiles/collectibles/15BUCKY.html |title=Design – A Three-Wheel Dream That Died at Takeoff – Buckminster Fuller and the Dymaxion Car |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 15, 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life.&lt;ref name="Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe" /&gt; Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's [[Chronofile]] archives, housed at [[Stanford University]]. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.&lt;ref name="2008-NYTimes-Fuller-Whitney-Museum-of-American-Art"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/arts/music/15ster.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Love Song of R.

===Recovery===
In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them ... finding ways of ''doing more with less'' to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more."{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} By 1928, Fuller was living in [[Greenwich Village]] and spending much of his time at the popular café [[Romany Marie]]'s,&lt;ref name="HaberGlueck"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author-link= John Haber |first=John |last= Haber |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]] ''Best of Friends'' exhibit (May 19, 2006 – October 15, 2006) |quote= [[Isamu Noguchi|Noguchi]], then twenty-five, had already had enough influences for a lifetime&amp;nbsp;— from birth in Los Angeles, to childhood in Japan and [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], to premedical classes at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], to academic sculpture on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], to [[Brancusi's circle]] in Paris.

Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around [[Dymaxion house|his first major design]], plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired.

===Geodesic domes===
Fuller taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in [[North Carolina]] during the summers of 1948 and 1949,&lt;ref name="ExhibitBMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title=IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College, July 15 – November 26, 2005 |work=Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115004344/http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.

Fuller's first "continuous tension – discontinuous compression" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R. Buckminster |last2=Fuller |location=Garden City, N.Y. |publisher=Anchor Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-385-01804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.

===Dymaxion Chronofile===
[[File:Dynamaxion 1933.jpg|right|thumb|A 1933 Dymaxion prototype]] 
For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.

[[File:Buckminster Fuller dome in Carbondale.jpg|right|thumb|[[R. Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlett Dome Home|Fuller's home]] in Carbondale]]
International recognition began with the success of huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at [[NC State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.

Fuller began working with architect [[Shoji Sadao]]&lt;ref name="wrsc.org"/&gt; in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large [[geodesic dome]] for the [[Montreal Biosphere|U.S. Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="wrsc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrsc.org/people/shoji-sadao |title=Shoji Sadao |work=World Resource Simulation Center |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This building is now the "[[Montreal Biosphère]]".
In 1962, the artist and searcher [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.

From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in Fuller's own words, devoted to "applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity." Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|SIU Edwardsville]], where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |title=The Center for Spirituality &amp; Sustainability |publisher=Siue.edu |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313014223/http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml# |archive-date=March 13, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of "omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity." Fuller referred to himself as "the property of universe" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work "the property of all humanity". For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.

===Honors===
Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=2007&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=2007&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007&amp;q=%22inventor%3A+richard+buckminster+fuller%22&amp;btnG=Search+Patents |title=Partial list of Fuller U.S. patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] from [[The Franklin Institute]]. Fuller was elected as an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year).&lt;ref name="PhiBetaKappa1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic576105.files/Harvard-elected-1966-81.pdf |title=Catalogue of Members: Harvard members elected from 1966-1981 |publisher=Harvard College Phi Beta Kappa |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckyFullerNowBio4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.buckyfullernow.com/sect-4-bio-of-buckminster-fuller-1947---1976.html|first=L.

===Last filmed appearance===
Fuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in ''[[I Build the Tower]],'' a documentary film on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.

===Death===
[[File:Bucky TRIMTAB.jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone (see [[Trim tab#Trim tab as a metaphor|trim tab]])]]
Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital&lt;!-- What was the name of this hospital? --&gt;, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: "She is squeezing my hand!" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Philosophy and worldview==
Buckminster Fuller was a Unitarian like his grandfather, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Arthur Buckminster Fuller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019224827/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-19 |title=Arthur Buckminster Fuller }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/buckminster-fuller-3/ |title=Buckminster Fuller: Designer of a New World, 1895-1983 |work=Harvard Square Library |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806065007/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/fuller.html |archivedate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early [[environmental activist]]. He was aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle that he termed "[[ephemeralization]]", which according to futurist and Fuller disciple [[Stewart Brand]], he coined to mean "doing more with less".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brand |first=Stewart |title=The Clock of the Long Now |location=New York |publisher=Basic |year=1999 |isbn=0-465-04512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and waste from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]], a term which he used broadly as a metaphor for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term [[synergy]] became popular.{{Citation needed|reason=When did the term "synergy" become "popular"?|date=October 2016}}

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy]] and [[material efficiency]] in the fields of architecture, engineering and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

Fuller was concerned about [[sustainability]] and human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the "technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," his analysis of the condition of "Spaceship Earth" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary.

Fuller was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s idea of [[general semantics]]. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the [[Institute of General Semantics]], and he delivered the annual [[Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Individuals Influenced by General Semantics|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/the-general-semantics-learning-center/overview-of-general-semantics/notable-individuals/|publisher=The Institute of General Semantics|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]]''. The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drake|first=Harold L.|title=The General Semantics and Science Fiction of Robert heinlein and A.

Lee Award in General Semantics offered by the International Society for General Semantics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1970 book ''I Seem To Be a Verb'', he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe."

Fuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Amy, "A Fuller Explanation", Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss&lt;/ref&gt;

He had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 "Dymaxion Award" for "poetically economic" domed living structures.

==Major design projects==
[[File:Géode V 3 1.gif|frame|A geodesic sphere]]

===The geodesic dome===
Fuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] – [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] for the [[Planetarium Jena|Zeiss-Planetarium]], built some 28 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), is the same design as Bauersfeld's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/geodome.htm |title=Geodesic Domes and Charts of the Heavens |publisher=Telacommunications.com |date=1973-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple "[[tensegrity]]" structures (tetrahedron, [[octahedron]], and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R.

The Dymaxion was not an automobile ''per se'', but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive &amp;mdash; an "Omni-Medium Transport" for air, land and water.&lt;ref name="Marks 1973 104"&gt;{{Cite book

The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform,&lt;ref name="universe"/&gt; and Fuller noted the Dymaxion "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements."&lt;ref name="universe"/&gt;

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its [[Automobile platform|platform]] featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° [[steering|steering lock]]. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation,  bringing nearby traffic to a halt.&lt;ref name="Kleiner"&gt;{{cite web

  | quote = In 1934, Fuller had interested auto magnate Walter Chrysler in financing his Dymaxion car, a durable, three-wheeled, aerodynamic land vehicle modeled after an airplane fuselage. Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. "You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce," the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &amp;mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete.

===Housing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion house at [[The Henry Ford]]]]
Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion house]] garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term "Dymaxion" is used in effect to signify a "radically strong and light tensegrity structure". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened "bell" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325–344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design included a "Go-Ahead-With-Life Room" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel "through time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed {{convert|90|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A study of a prototype floating community|author=R. Buckminster Fuller|publisher=Triton Foundation|year=1968|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of the city aroused the interest of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] who, after leaving office, had them placed in the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971dec04-00080 |title=Cities on the Sea? |first=John |last=Lear |journal=The Saturday Review |volume=54 |date=December 4, 1971 |page=90 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

===Dymaxion map and World Game===
Fuller, along with co-cartographer [[Shoji Sadao]], also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players attempt to solve world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with WORLD SERIES 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man's temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of [Robert] Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine.

==Quirks==
Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|290}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |title=Annals of Innovation: Dymaxion Man: Reporting &amp; Essays |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fuller |first = Buckminster |title = [[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |publisher = Southern Illinois University Press |location = Carbondale |year = 1969 |isbn = 0-8093-2461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.&lt;ref name="Kenner-Guided-Tour"/&gt;{{rp|290}}

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with [[polyphasic sleep]], which he called ''Dymaxion sleep''.

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately {{convert|270|ft|m}} of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at [[Stanford]] University.

In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply "Bucky".

==Language and neologisms==
Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;"What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often "common sense" to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense." Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled "What I Am Trying to Do." And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that "by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences."&lt;ref&gt;"How Little I Know" from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "down" and "up", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words "in" and "out" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going "outstairs" and "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

"World-around" is a term coined by Fuller to replace "worldwide". The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using "wide" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse", replacing "sunrise" and "sunset" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].

Fuller also invented the word "livingry," as opposed to weaponry (or "killingry"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. "The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry."&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term "[[tensegrity]]" from ''tensional integrity''. "Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder."&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Dymaxion]]" is a portmanteau of "'''dy'''namic '''max'''imum tens'''ion'''". It was invented about 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.&lt;ref&gt;''R. Buckminster Fuller – Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: "The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it."&lt;ref name="cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&amp;name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[allotropy|allotrope]] of [[carbon]], [[fullerene]]—and a particular molecule of that allotrope C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; ([[buckminsterfullerene]] or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller's geodesic dome. The 1996 [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry was given to [[Harry Kroto|Kroto]], [[Robert Curl|Curl]], and [[Richard Smalley|Smalley]] for their discovery of the fullerene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/index.html |title=Chemistry 1996 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the songs within the album are based upon his life and works.

On July 12, 2004, the [[United States Post Office]] released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp's design replicated the January 10, 1964 cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

Fuller was the subject of two documentary films: ''[[The World of Buckminster Fuller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud]]'' (1996). Additionally, filmmaker [[Sam Green (filmmaker)|Sam Green]] and the band [[Yo La Tengo]] collaborated on a 2012 "live documentary" about Fuller, ''The Love Song of R.

It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |title=Chicago's MCA to show ''Buckminster Fuller ~ Starting with the Universe'' |year=2009 |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407000421/http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] hosted "The Utopian Impulse" – a show about Buckminster Fuller's influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating "free energy" from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/903 "The Utopian Impulse,"] San Francisco Museum of Modern Art press release, retrieved April 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different note, Fuller's quote "Those who play with the Devil's toys, will be brought by degree to wield his sword" was used and referenced as the first display seen in the strategy sci-fi video game ''[[XCOM: Enemy Within]]'' developed by [[Firaxis Games]].

''[[The House of Tomorrow (2017 film)|The House of Tomorrow]]'', is a 2017 American independent drama film written and directed by [[Peter Livolsi]], based on [[Peter Bognanni]]'s 2010 novel of the same name, featuring [[Asa Butterfield]], [[Alex Wolff]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Maude Apatow]], and [[Ellen Burstyn]].  Burstyn's character is obsessed by all things Buckminster Fuller providing retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home, including authentic video of Buckminster Fuller talking and sailing with Ellen Burstyn, who'd actually befriended him in real life.

[[File:Cloaking device simulation (active).jpg|thumb|Simulation of how a cloaking device would work. Cloaking device active: Light is deflected around the object, causing it to be invisible]]

A '''cloaking device''' is a hypothetical or fictional [[stealth technology]] that can cause objects, such as [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] or individuals, to be partially or wholly [[Invisibility|invisible]] to parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic (EM) spectrum]]. However, over the entire spectrum, a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object.&lt;ref name="monticone2013do"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional cloaking devices have been used as [[plot device]]s in various media for many years.

Developments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one [[wavelength]] of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called [[metamaterial]]s to bend light around an object.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, Gary. "Going Where No One Has Gone Before", ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' #3. {{ISSN|1793-5725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual origins==
''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' screenwriter [[Paul Schneider (writer)|Paul Schneider]], inspired in part by the 1958 film ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]],'' and in part by ''[[The Enemy Below]],'' which in turn had been released the previous year, 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a [[submarine]] submerging, and employed it in the 1966 ''Star Trek'' episode "[[Balance of Terror]]", in which he introduced the [[Romulan]] species. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, "selective bending of light" as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another ''Star Trek'' screenwriter, [[D.C. Fontana]], coined the term ''"cloaking device"'' for the 1968 episode "[[The Enterprise Incident|The ''Enterprise'' Incident]]", which also featured Romulans.

Writers and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including &lt;!-- Please don't add more pop-culture examples of cloaking devices. This article is about the real-world development, not a crufty list comprising every game they've ever appeared in! A link to this article doesn't necessitate a reciprocal link. --&gt;''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', and ''[[Stargate]]''.

==Scientific experimentation==
An operational, [[non-fiction]]al cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually [[infrared]]), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as "[[active camouflage]]". Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the 'cloaked' object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Robert F. |last1=Service | first2= Adrian |last2= Cho |title= Strange New Tricks With Light |journal= Science |pages= 1622 |volume= 330 |date= 17 December 2010|bibcode = 2010Sci...330.1622S |doi=10.1126/science.330.6011.1622 |issue=6011 |pmid=21163994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metamaterial research===
{{main|Metamaterial cloaking}}
Optical [[metamaterial]]s have featured in several recent proposals for invisibility schemes. "Metamaterials" refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using [[transformation optics]] it is possible to design the optical parameters of a "cloak" so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.&lt;ref name="pendry2006controlling"&gt;

These spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using [[metamaterials]]. There are several [[theories of cloaking]], giving rise to different types of invisibility.&lt;ref name="inami2003optical"&gt;

In 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial.  This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating.  When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David R. |title= A cloaking coating for murky media |journal=Science|pages= 384–385 |volume= 345 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1256753|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..384S |pmid=25061192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schittny, Robert et cl. |title= Invisibility cloaking in a diffuse light scattering medium |journal=Science|pages= 427–429 |volume= 345 |date= 25 July 2014 |doi=10.1126/science.1254524|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..427S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Active camouflage]]'' (or ''adaptive camouflage'') is a group of [[camouflage]] technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.

''Optical camouflage'' is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion.  The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.

It has been reported that the [[British Army]] has tested an invisible tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490669/Army-tests-James-Bond-style-tank-invisible.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Army tests James Bond style tank that is 'invisible' | date=30 October 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724063741/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490669/Army-tests-James-Bond-style-tank-invisible.html | archivedate=24 July 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Josh.

===Plasma stealth===
{{Main|Plasma stealth}}
[[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990sri..reptQ....V Plasma cloaking: Air chemistry, broadband absorption, and plasma generation] [http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html backup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802184503/http://www.stormingmedia.us/44/4402/A440222.html |date=2009-08-02 }}, February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defense Technical Information Center]] is also following up research on plasma reducing [[Radar cross-section|RCS]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Gregoire, D.

"Microwave absorption system" {{US patent|4989006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metascreen===
A prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few [[micrometers]] thick and to a limited extent can hide [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer's positions. It was prepared at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] by Professor [[Andrea Alù]].&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2298863/Invisibility-cloaks-reality-scientists-invent-ultra-material-hides-objects.html|work=Daily Mail|date=25 March 2013|title=Invisibility cloaks are almost a reality after scientists invent ultra-thin material that hides objects from microwaves|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505004438/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2298863/Invisibility-cloaks-reality-scientists-invent-ultra-material-hides-objects.html|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|work=PhysicsWorld.com|date=28 March 2013|title=Ultrathin "metascreen" forms latest invisibility cloak|author=Tim Wogan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817232220/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/mar/28/ultrathin-metascreen-forms-latest-invisibility-cloak|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a [[fishing net]].  In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt;  The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order.&lt;ref name=physicsworld.com/&gt; The same researchers published a paper on "[[Theories of cloaking#Plasmonic cover|plasmonic cloaking]]" the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630 New Journal of Physics, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Howell/Choi cloaking device ===
University of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the "[[Rochester Cloak]]". The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the optical pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first =| authorlink =| title = Cloaking' device uses ordinary lenses to hide objects across range of angles| work = Science Daily| publisher = Science Daily| date = 29 September 2014| url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| doi =| accessdate = 29 September 2014| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141001000527/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140929085221.htm| dead-url =yes| archivedate =2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloaking in mechanics===
The concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object "invisible" to sound or even hides it from touching.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Bückmann | first = Tiemo | year = 2014 | title = An elasto-mechanical unfeelability cloak made of pentamode metamaterials | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 5 | issue = 4130 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms5130 | url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140619/ncomms5130/full/ncomms5130.html | bibcode = 2014NatCo...5E4130B | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202133647/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140619/ncomms5130/full/ncomms5130.html | archivedate = 2016-02-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clover''' is a cloud-based Android point of sale ([[Point of sale|POS]]) platform that was launched in April 2012. The company is headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, CA]]. Clover was acquired on December 28, 2012 by [[First Data|First Data Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/09/first-data-quietly-buys-payments-startup-clover-launches-point-of-sale-platform-for-merchants/ | title=First Data Quietly Buys Payments Startup Clover; Launches Point of Sale Platform for Merchants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank of America Merchant Services was the first to announce it would sell Clover to its merchant base in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://merch.bankofamerica.com/cloverdetailspage | title=POS Device Solutions for Small Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/press-releases/10_09_13.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215505/https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/press-releases/10_09_13.html |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PNC Merchant Services was the second to announce it would sell Clover to its merchant base.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Blank.do?siteArea=/pnccorp/PNC/Home/Small+Business/Merchant+Services/Accept+Payments/Merchant+Services+Clover&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Funding &amp; early history===
Clover was incorporated in October 15, 2010 and raised $5.5M on November 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517885/000151788511000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml | title=Sec Form D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead investor was [[Sutter Hill Ventures]] with participation from [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and a number of angel investors.  The company was founded by John Beatty, Leonard Speiser, and Kelvin Zheng.  The company secured an additional $3M convertible note from Sutter Hill Ventures in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517885/000151788512000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml | title=Sec Form D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First hardware product ===
Clover launched its first hardware solution, the Clover Station, in 2013 and began shipping it in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gigaom.com/2013/10/09/after-a-quiet-year-clover-emerges-with-a-sexy-cash-register-a-new-owner/ | title=After a quiet year, Clover emerges with a sexy cash register &amp; a new owner| date=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover opened its App Marketplace to third party developers in 2014. [[First Data#Gyft|Gyft]] announced the launch of its Gift Cloud Service on Clover in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1837151 | title=Gyft Announces Launch of First Cloud-based Mobile Gift Card Solution for Small to Mid-Sized Businesses - Press Release - Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First Data announced the sale of 17,000 Clover Stations six months after the release of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-16/kkr-banks-on-bisignano-forging-apple-deal-at-first-data.html | title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This put Clover ahead of Square Stand in terms of total units shipped.

On September 9, 2014 Clover announced its work with Apple to support Apple Pay via its Android POS Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://clover-developers.blogspot.com/2014/09/apple-pay.html | title=Clover Developers Blog: How Apple Pay works and why it matters for developers| date=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clover described the functionality in a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://clover-developers.blogspot.com/2014/09/apple-pay.html | title=Clover Developers Blog: How Apple Pay works and why it matters for developers| date=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was featured on the home page of Hacker News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8292140 | title=How Apple Pay works and why it matters for developers &amp;#124; Hacker News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second hardware product ===
Clover announced its second hardware product, the Clover Mobile, at the Money 20/20 conference in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/first-data-debuts-clover-mobile-a-wireless-tablet-based-point-of-sale/ | title=First Data Debuts Clover Mobile, A Wireless, Tablet-Based Point-Of-Sale}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 2015, Clover Mobile won the Gold medal for the Best POS innovation at the PYMNTS.com Innovator Awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/all-features/clover-mobile-wins-gold.html | title=All Small Business Payment Solutions &amp;#124; First Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover Mobile features a complete EMVCo compliant payments solution with an on-screen pin-pad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mobile | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is fully PCI PTS 4.0 compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-40156&lt;/ref&gt; It also features an EMVCo compliant Contactless payment interface which enables it to support Apple Pay among other contactless payment modes. The device has an ergonomic handle with an integrated barcode scanner&lt;ref&gt; https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/marketing-merchant/FD_Solutions_with_Clover_Mobile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - with an external wireless mobile printer accessory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/accessories?accessoriesTypeGroup=mobile | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to keep the device lightweight and reduce fatigue.

=== Third hardware product ===
Clover's third hardware product, the Clover Mini was launched by First Data on June 16, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150616006141/en/Data-Launches-Clover%C2%AE-Mini-Future-Payment-Terminals | title=First Data Launches Clover® Mini, the Future of Payment Terminals| date=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Clover Mobile, Clover Mini&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mini | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a PCI PTS 4.0 approved,&lt;ref&gt; https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-40158&lt;/ref&gt; EMVCo compliant contact and contactless next generation payment device. Clover Mini has a built-in receipt printer and is designed to be a terminal replacement with the support for advanced payments interfaces, while also allowing Merchants to install apps from the Clover App Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/appmarket/ | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clover Mini also features an USB hub allowing easy interface of peripherals such as external barcode scanners, cash drawer &lt;ref&gt;https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/marketing-merchant/FD_Solutions_with_Clover_Mini.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a Merchant keypad (for cases where the Mini is Customer-facing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/accessories?accessoriesTypeGroup=mini | title=Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
On December 28, 2012, Clover entered into a merger agreement with First Data Corporation.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/740112/000104746913011139/a2217468zs-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview with Wharton professor Rahul Kapoor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innonavi.com/recent-guests/ | title=Recent Guests}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure of the acquisition was explained.  An operating agreement was put into place whereby Clover would receive $100M in funding to run independently.  First Data would be responsible for sales and support, while Clover built all new payment hardware/software for the company.  The deal utilized a "Founder's Clause" that would trigger a very large penalty payment if the parent company interfered with operations of Clover.  Thirty two months after the acquisition Clover was mentioned 88 times in the S-1 filed by First Data Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883980/000119312515256975/d31022ds1.htm | title=Form S-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">{{For|the curriculum program|Design and Technology}}'''Design technology''', or D.T., is the study, design, development, application, implementation, support and management of computer and non-computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating product design intent and constructability. Design technology can be applied to the problems encountered in construction, operation and maintenance of a product.

At times there is cross-over between D.T. and [[Information Technology]], whereas I.T. is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure, hardware &amp; software requirements, and implementation, D.T. is specifically focused on supporting, maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T. to provide necessary infrastructure, for the most effective use of these applications and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Information Technology {{!}} North Dakota ITD|url = https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/definition-information-technology|website = www.nd.gov|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building design, construction and maintenance industry (also known as AEC/O/FM), the product is the building and the role of D.T., is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process. D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Solutions {{!}} BIM|url = http://www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com/solutions/bim-modeling|website = www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Thomas Enterprise|last = Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; So though D.T. encompasses [[Building information modeling|BIM]] and Integrated Project Delivery, I.P.D., it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D., Virtual Design &amp; Construction, V.D.C., as well as historical and legacy data and systems.

D.T. is also applicable to industrial and product design and the [[manufacturing]] and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication processes]] therein.

There are formal courses of study in some countries known as [[design and technology]] that focus on particular areas. In this case the above definition still remains valid, if for instance one takes the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile.

! style="background:#fff;" | Types of Innovation&lt;ref name=Christensen2003p_xviii&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997|p=xviii}}. Christensen describes as "revolutionary" innovations as "discontinuous" "sustaining innovations".&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|
;Sustaining: An innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets. It may be either:

:;Evolutionary: An innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting (e.g., [[fuel injection]] for gasoline engines, which displaced [[carburetor]]s.)

:;Revolutionary (discontinuous, radical): An innovation that is unexpected, but nevertheless does not affect existing markets (e.g., the first [[automobile]]s in the late 19th century, which were expensive luxury items, and as such very few were sold)

;Disruptive: An innovation that creates a ''new'' market by providing a different set of values, which ultimately (and unexpectedly) overtakes an existing market (e.g., the lower-priced, affordable [[Ford Model T]], which displaced horse-drawn carriages)
|}

In [[business administration|business]], a '''disruptive innovation''' is an [[innovation]] that creates a new [[Market (economics)|market]] and [[value network]] and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market-leading firms, products, and alliances. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ab Rahman |first=Airini |title=Emerging Technologies with Disruptive Effects: A Review |journal=PERINTIS eJournal |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Umar_Zakir_Abdul_Hamid/publication/321906585_Emerging_Technologies_with_Disruptive_Effects_A_Review/links/5a38fb87a6fdccdd41ff013d/Emerging-Technologies-with-Disruptive-Effects-A-Review.pdf |display-authors=etal|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined and first analyzed by the American scholar [[Clayton M. Christensen]] and his collaborators beginning in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Joseph L. &amp; Christensen, Clayton M. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bagehot|date=15 June 2017|work=The Economist|page=53|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21723426-labours-leader-has-disrupted-business-politics-jeremy-corbyn-entrepreneur|title=Jeremy Corbyn, Entrepreneur|quote=The most influential business idea of recent years is Clayton Christensen’s theory of disruptive innovation.|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first [[automobile]]s in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced [[Ford Model T]] in 1908.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=49}} The ''mass-produced'' automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not.

Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[entrepreneur]]s in [[startups]], rather than existing market-leading companies. The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition).&lt;ref name="Christensen1997p47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|1997|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.&lt;ref name=Assink&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Assink | first1 = Marnix | year = 2006 | title = Inhibitors of disruptive innovation capability: a conceptual model | url = | journal = European Journal of Innovation Management | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 215–233 | doi=10.1108/14601060610663587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt [[complex system]]s, including economic and business-related aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durantin|first1=Arnaud|last2=Fanmuy|first2=Gauthier|last3=Miet|first3=Ségolène|last4=Pegon|first4=Valérie|title=Disruptive Innovation in Complex Systems|journal=Complex Systems Design &amp; Management|date=1 January 2017|pages=41–56|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-49103-5_4|publisher=Springer, Cham|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage of the term==
The term '''disruptive technologies''' was coined by [[Clayton M. Christensen]] and introduced in his 1995 article ''Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave'',&lt;ref&gt;Bower, Joseph L. &amp; Christensen, Clayton M. (1995). However the concept of new technologies leading to wholesale economic change is not a new idea since [[Joseph Schumpeter]] adapted the idea of creative destruction from [[Karl Marx]]. Schumpeter (1949) in one of his examples used "the railroadization of the Middle West as it was initiated by the Illinois Central".

In his sequel with Michael E. Raynor, ''The Innovator's Solution'',&lt;ref name="Christensen2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Christensen|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen replaced the term ''disruptive technology'' with ''disruptive innovation'' because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character; rather, it is the ''business model'' that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact. However, Christensen's evolution from a technological focus to a business-modelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level. Christensen and Mark W. Johnson, who cofounded the management consulting firm [[Innosight]], described the dynamics of "business model innovation" in the 2008 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Reinventing Your Business Model".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark, Christensen, Clayton, et al., 2008, "Reinventing Your Business Model, ''Harvard Business Review'', December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of [[innovation]] by economists, and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level.

The term “disruptive innovation” is misleading when it is used to refer to a product or service at one fixed point, rather than to the evolution of that product or service over time.

In the late 1990s, the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of "constructive disruptive technology" by working with the consultant David E. O'Ryan, whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called "an unfair advantage". The process or technology change as a whole had to be "constructive" in improving the current method of manufacturing, yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model, resulting in a significant reduction of waste, energy, materials, labor, or legacy costs to the user.

In keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model, not the technological sophistication itself, Christensen's theory explains why many disruptive innovations are ''not'' "advanced technologies", which a default hypothesis would lead one to expect. Rather, they are often novel combinations of existing off-the-shelf components, applied cleverly to a small, fledgling value network.

Online news site TechRepublic suggests to end using the term, and similar related terms, being that it is overused jargon as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Conner Forrest, May 1, 2014, 5:52 AM PST, https://www.techrepublic.com/article/startup-jargon-10-terms-to-stop-using/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default, an idea that [[Clayton M. Christensen]] called the "technology mudslide hypothesis". This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't "keep up technologically" with other firms. In this hypothesis, firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing, where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still, and any break from the effort (such as complacency born of profitability) causes a rapid downhill slide. Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong; it doesn't model reality. What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations, but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). In Christensen's terms, a firm's existing ''value networks'' place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value networks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network. At that time, the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the [[market share]] attack with a me-too entry, for which survival (not thriving) is the only reward.&lt;ref name="Christensen1997p47"/&gt;

Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers.
{{quote|Generally, disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches. They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.{{sfn|Christensen|1997|p=15}}}}

Christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development. These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations, because the markets have very tight [[profit margin]]s and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established (sizable) firm.{{sfn|Christensen|1997|p=i-iii}} Thus, disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to "[[marketing#Customer orientation|focus on the customer]]" (or "stay close to the customer", or "listen to the customer") can be strategically counterproductive.

While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies, O'Ryan countered that "constructive" integration of existing, new, and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies, once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole.

[[File:Disruptivetechnology.png|thumb|upright=2|How low-end disruption occurs over time.{{Clarify|reason=Can someone explain what is depicted here?|date=November 2017}}]]
{{Anchor|Technological_disruption_low-end_vs_new-market}}Christensen distinguishes between "low-end disruption", which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market, and "new-market disruption", which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=23-45}}

"Low-end disruption" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance. Therefore, at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments. At this point, a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments, thereby gaining a foothold in the market.

In low-end disruption, the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer, who is happy with a good enough product. This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality. Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment, it seeks to improve its profit margin. To get higher profit margins, the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality. To ensure this quality in its product, the disruptor needs to innovate. The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment, and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers. After a number of such encounters, the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving. And then, finally, the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market.

"New market disruption" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry.

==Disruptive technology==
In 2009, [[Milan Zeleny]] described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted. The answer, according to Zeleny, is the ''support network'' of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeleny|first=Milan|title=High Technology and Barriers to Innovation: From Globalization to Localization|journal=[[International Journal of Information Technology &amp; Decision Making]]|volume=11|page=P 441|publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars (network of gas and service stations). Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners. In the long run, high (disruptive) technology bypasses, upgrades, or replaces the outdated support network.
Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology, Haxell (2012) questions how such technologies get named and framed, pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act.&lt;ref&gt;Haxell, A. (2013). Enactments of change: Becoming textually active at Youthline NZ. (PhD Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation), Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia. Retrieved from http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30061580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhatt, I. (2017).

Technology, being a form of social relationship,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} always evolves. No technology remains fixed. Technology starts, develops, persists, mutates, stagnates, and declines, just like living [[organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Opening up the innovation process: towards an agenda | last=Oliver | first=Gassmann | journal=R&amp;D Management |date=May 2006  | volume=36 | issue=03 | pages=P 223–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology. A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing [[technology support net]]s (TSNs), which are thus forced to coevolve with it. New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN, with smaller and smaller high-technology effects. High technology becomes regular technology, with more efficient versions fitting the same support net. Finally, even the efficiency gains diminish, emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes (appearance, style), and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology. This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated, resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation; then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated.

Regarding this evolving process of technology, [[Clayton M. Christensen|Christensen]] said:
{{quote|The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view. They do, however, have two important characteristics: First, they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that, at least at the outset, are not valued by existing customers. Second, the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Disruptive Technologies Catching the Wave | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=January 1995  | page=P 3 | first1=Clayton | last1=Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426 Joseph Bower]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HBS Faculty &amp; Research|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6426}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained the process of how disruptive technology, through its requisite support net, dramatically transforms a certain industry.
{{quote|When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges, established companies typically see it as unattractive: it’s not something their mainstream customers want, and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure. As a result, the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers. But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market. Once the disruptive technology becomes established there, smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=9f3ed8e7-4200-4c5d-9d35-c43991bd16ec%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4213&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=bth&amp;AN=6623927 | title=Disruptive Change | journal=Harvard Business Review |date=May 2002  | volume=80 | issue=05 | pages=P 95–101 | first1=Joseph | last1=Bower}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage; however, it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable, unchanging TSN. The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of [[electric car]]—whether the energy source is the sun, hydrogen, water, air pressure, or traditional charging outlet. Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile. The printing press was a development that changed the way that information was stored, transmitted, and replicated. This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted censorship and information overload in writing technology.

[[Milan Zeleny]] described the above phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Advanced Management Systems |date=January 2009  | volume=01 | issue=01 | pages=P 8–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that:
{{quote|Implementing high technology is often resisted. This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN. The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines (ATMs) were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers. Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted. Middle management resists [[business process reengineering]] because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net (coordinative hierarchy) they thrive on. Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Technology and High Technology: Support Net and Barriers to Innovation | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | journal=Acta Mechanica Slovaca |date=September 2009  | volume=36 | issue=01 | pages=P 6–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports. More specifically, the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on T.V., radio, and newspapers. Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports.

==High-technology effects==
[[High technology]] is a technology core that changes the very architecture (structure and organization) of the components of the [[technology support net]]. High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations, as well as their requisite physical, energy, and information flows. It also affects the skills required, the roles played, and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself.

This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core, which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way, but faster, more reliably, in larger quantities, or more efficiently. It is also different from appropriate technology core, which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency, instead of improving the efficiency of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of strategic alliances in high-technology new product development | last=Masaaki | first=Kotabe |author2=Scott Swan  | journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=January 2007  | volume=16 | issue=08 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250160804 | pages=621–636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the difference between high technology and low technology, Milan Zeleny once said:
{{quote|The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself, therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity. High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost, net present value or return on investment. Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful. For example, you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter, but not a typewriter with a word processor. Therein lies the management challenge of high technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Milan | last1=Zeleny | title=Knowledge-information autopoietic cycle: towards the wisdom systems | date=2006 | journal=International Journal of Management and Decision Making  | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=P 3–18 | doi=10.1504/IJMDM.2006.008168}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, not all modern technologies are high technologies. They have to be used as such, function as such, and be embedded in their requisite TSNs. They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge. Not all information technologies have integrative effects. Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN. The administrative model of management, for instance, further aggravates the division of task and labor, further specializes knowledge, separates management from workers, and concentrates information and knowledge in centers.

As knowledge surpasses capital, labor, and raw materials as the dominant economic resource, technologies are also starting to reflect this shift. Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks. Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind, super-book, or super-database, but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action.

==Practical example of disruption==
In the practical world, the popularization of [[personal computers]] illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation. The original centralized concept (one computer, many persons) is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing, and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent. The era of personal computing brought powerful computers "on every desk" (one person, one computer). This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment, but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge. Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing (one person, many computers). Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers, databases, and mainframes, as well as production, distribution, and retailing facilities, and the like. For the first time, technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies. It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs: at the [[Locus of control|loci]] of the useful knowledge. Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate, free and empowered individuals do; knowledge, innovation, spontaneity, and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/views_from_the_front_lines_of_the_data_analytics_revolution | title=Views from the front lines of the data-analytics revolution | publisher=McKinsey Quarterly | last=Brown | first=Brad | date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PLEASE PROVIDE SOURCES THAT ARGUE THAT THE INNOVATION YOU ARE ADDING IS A DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION. 
To be a disruptive innovation it must have: 
DISRUPTED SOME MARKET BECAUSE NO ONE SAW IT COMING. 
i.e., firms went out of business, there were enormous changes in market share. Otherwise it's just not that disruptive.

|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Plastic]] || Metal, wood, glass etc. || [[Bakelite]] and other early plastics had very limited use - their main advantages were electric insulation and low cost. New forms of plastic had advantages such as transparency, elasticity and combustibility. In the early 21st century, plastics can be used for many household items previously made of metal, wood and glass.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| Medical || [[Ultrasound]] || [[Radiography]] (X-ray imaging) || Ultrasound technology is disruptive relative to X-ray imaging. Ultrasound was a new-market disruption. None of the X-ray companies participated in ultrasound until they acquired major ultrasound equipment companies.{{sfn|Christensen|2003|p=64}}

| rowspan="4" | Music and video  || [[Digital synthesizer]] || [[Electronic organ]], [[electric piano]] and [[piano]] || Synthesizers were initially low-cost, low-weight alternatives to electronic organs, [[electric piano]]s and acoustic pianos. In the 2010s, synthesizers are significantly cheaper than electric pianos and acoustic pianos, all while offering a much greater range of sound effects and musical sounds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| Downloadable [[Digital media]] || [[Compact Disc|CD]]s, [[DVD]]s || In the 1990s, the [[music industry]] phased out the vinyl record [[single (music)|single]], leaving consumers with no means to purchase individual songs. This market was initially filled by illegal [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] technologies, and then by online retailers such as the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Amazon.com]]. 

This low end disruption eventually undermined the sales of physical, high-cost recordings such as records, tapes and CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Knopper | first = Steve  | date = 2009  | title = Appetite for self-destruction : the spectacular crash of the record industry in the digital age  | isbn = 1-4165-5215-4  | publisher = Free Press  | location = New York  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Streaming video]] || [[Video rental]] || [[Video on demand]] software can run on many Internet-enabled devices. Since licensing deals between film studios and streaming providers have become standard, this has obviated the need for people to seek rentals at physically separate locations. [[Netflix]], a dominant company in this market, was cited as a significant threat to video stores when it first expanded beyond [[DVD by mail]] offerings. The Netflix co-founders approached rental chain [[Blockbuster LLC]] in 2000 trying to sell their company. Blockbuster declined and ultimately ceased operation ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703384204575509331302481448|title=Blockbuster to remake itself under creditors|first=Mike|last=Spector|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2010-09-24|accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| rowspan="2" | Photography || [[Digital photography]] || Chemical photography || Early digital cameras suffered from low picture quality and resolution and long [[shutter lag]]. Quality and resolution are no longer major issues in the 2010s and shutter lag issues have been largely resolved. The convenience of small memory cards and portable hard drives that hold hundreds or thousands of pictures, as well as the lack of the need to develop these pictures, also helped make digital cameras the market leader. Digital cameras have a high power consumption (but several lightweight battery packs can provide enough power for thousands of pictures).

Cameras for classic photography are stand-alone devices. In the same manner, high-resolution [[digital video]] recording has replaced [[film stock]], except for high-budget motion pictures and fine art.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The rise of digital cameras led [[Eastman Kodak]], one of the largest camera companies for decades, to declare bankruptcy in 2012. Despite inventing one of the first digital cameras in 1975, Kodak remained invested in traditional film until much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/this-man-invented-the-digital-camera-in-1975-and-his-bosses-at-kodak-never-let-it-see-the-light-of-day-2015-8|title=Inventor of digital camera says Kodak never let it see the light of day|first=Nathan|last=McAlone|publisher=Business Insider|date=2015-08-17|accessdate=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pradeepsingh.com/kodak-digital-revolution/|title=Kodak and The Digital Revolution - Management of Innovation and Change — PRADEEP SINGH|date=2015-03-05|work=PRADEEP SINGH|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[High speed photography|High speed]] [[CMOS]] [[video sensor technology|video sensor]]s || [[Photographic film]] || When first introduced, high speed CMOS sensors were less sensitive, had lower resolution, and cameras based on them had less duration (record time). The advantage of rapid setup time, editing in the camera, and nearly-instantaneous review quickly eliminated 16&amp;nbsp;mm high speed film systems. CMOS-based cameras also require less power (single phase 110 V AC and a few amps for high-performance CMOS, direct current 5V or 3.3V and two or three amps for low-power CMOS,&lt;ref&gt;iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/ref&gt; vs. 240 V single- or three-phase at 20-50 A for film cameras). Continuing advances have overtaken 35&amp;nbsp;mm film and are challenging 70&amp;nbsp;mm film applications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
&lt;!--- a similar statement may be said about CCD and SLR film photography, but I suggest it go in a separate entry EJH ---&gt;
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| rowspan="3" | Publishing || | [[Computer printer]]s || [[Offset printing]] || Offset printing has a high [[overhead cost]], but very low [[unit cost]] compared to computer printers, and superior quality. But as printers, especially [[laser printer]]s, have improved in speed and quality, they have become increasingly useful for creating documents in limited issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Desktop publishing]] || Traditional [[publishing]] || Early desktop-publishing systems could not match high-end professional systems in either features or quality, but their impact was felt immediately as they lowered the cost of entry to the publishing business. By the mid-1990s, DTP had largely replaced traditional tools in most prepress operations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Word Processing]] || [[Typewriter]] || The typewriter has been replaced with word processing software that has a wealth of functionality to stylize, copy and facilitate document production.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| rowspan="6" | Transportation || [[Steamboat]]s || [[Sailing ship]]s || The first steamships were deployed on inland waters where sailing ships were less effective, instead of on the higher profit margin seagoing routes. Hence steamships originally only competed in traditional shipping lines' "worst" markets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Automobile]]s || [[Rail transport]] || At the beginning of the 20th century, rail (including [[streetcars]]) was the fastest and most cost-efficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries. The first cars, buses and trucks were used for local transportation in [[suburb]]an areas, where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks. As highways expanded, medium- and later long-distance transports were relocated to road traffic, and some railways closed down. As rail traffic has a lower [[ton-kilometer]] cost, but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic, rail is still preferred for large-scale bulk cargo (such as minerals). However, [[traffic congestion]] provides a bound on the efficiency of car use, and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[High speed rail]] || Short distance flights || In almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service, the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely. Even in markets with longer rail travel times, airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down. Examples include the [[Barcelona-Madrid high speed railway]], the [[Cologne Frankfurt high speed railway]] (where no direct flights are available as of 2016) or the Paris-London connection after the opening of [[High Speed 1]]. For medium-distance trips, like between Beijing &amp; Shanghai, the high speed rail and airlines often end up in extremely stiff competition.
|-style="vertical-align: top;"
| [[Private jet]] || [[Supersonic transport]] || The [[Concorde]] aircraft has so far been the only supersonic airliner in extensive commercial traffic. However, it catered to a small customer segment, which could later afford small private sub-sonic jets. The loss of speed was compensated by flexibility and a more direct routing (i.e. no need to go through a [[airline hub|hub]]). Supersonic flight is also banned above inhabited land, due to [[sonic boom]]s. Concorde service ended in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title= Concorde grounded for good |publisher=''BBC News,'' 10 April 2003 |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David''' "'''Doc'''" '''Searls''' (born July 29, 1947), is an American journalist, columnist, and a widely read [[weblog|blog]]ger. He is a co-author of ''[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]'', author of ''[[The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge]]'', Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Linux Journal]]'', a fellow at the Center for Information Technology &amp; Society (CITS) at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and an alumnus fellow (2006–2010) of the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]].

==Overview==

A longtime advocate for [[open-source software]], Searls has been involved with the ''Linux Journal'' since it began publishing in 1994. He became a Contributing Editor in 1996, Senior Editor since 1999, and Editor-in-Chief in 2018. His column "Linux for Suits" ran until 2007, and was followed by "EOF" inside each issue's back cover. His work with ''Linux Journal'', and as an advocate of [[free software]] and [[open source]], earned him a [[Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award]] for Best Communicator in 2005. His byline has also appeared in many other publications, including ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''[[PC Magazine]]'', ''The Standard'', ''The Sun Magazine'', ''[[Upside (magazine)|Upside]]'', ''[[Release 1.0]]'' and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.

In early 1999 Searls joined [[Christopher Locke]], [[David Weinberger]] and Rick Levine in writing ''[[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]'', an iconoclastic website that was followed in January 2000 by the book with the same title. The book became a business bestseller and was published in nine languages. A 10th Anniversary edition came out in June 2009. Among Searls' contributions to the Manifesto was its first thesis, "Markets are conversations" – which is also the title of the ''Cluetrain'' chapter he co-wrote with David Weinberger. Weinberger and Searls co-wrote "[http://www.worldofends.com/ World of Ends: What the Internet Is and How to Stop Mistaking It for Something Else]".

Searls has also been a well-known blogger since October 1999, when he started blogging with help from his friend [[Dave Winer]]. In an Online Journalism Review article, [[J.D. Lasica]] calls Searls "one of the deep thinkers in the blog movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/lasica/1019165278.php Weblogs: A New Source of News], by J.D. Lasica, 2002-04-18, Online Journalism Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The World is Flat]]'', [[Thomas L. Friedman]] calls Searls "one of the most respected technology writers in America."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/reader/0312425074?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_books_pg&amp;qid=1246474727&amp;query=doc%20searls#reader The World is Flat], by Thomas L. Friedman&lt;/ref&gt;

Searls' two academic fellowships both began in 2006. At the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] he leads ProjectVRM, which guides independent software development communities working on [[Vendor Relationship Management]] (VRM). The purpose of VRM is to equip individuals with tools that provide both independence from vendor "lock-in" and better means for engaging with vendors. VRM tools and methods also help individuals engage with government and other non-commercial organizations. At the [[Center for Information Technology &amp; Society|Center for Information Technology and Society]] (CITS) at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Searls is studying both the nature of infrastructure and of the Internet as a form of infrastructure.

In April 2012, his book ''[[The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge]]'' was published. Searls coined the term in an article for ''[[Linux Journal]]''. He wrote: "The Intention Economy grows around buyers, not sellers. It leverages the simple fact that buyers are the first source of money, and that they come ready-made. You don't need advertising to make them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Doc | last=Searls | coauthors= | title=The Intention Economy | date=March 8, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000035 | work =Linux Journal | pages = | accessdate = September 28, 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The nickname "Doc" is what Searls calls a "fossil remnant" of "Doctor Dave," his humorous persona at WDBS (now [[WXDU]]) radio at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/02/04/getting-rained-out-in-a-brainstorm/ Getting rained out in a brainstorm], February 4, 2009, Doc Searls Weblog&lt;/ref&gt; Following his work in radio, Searls co-founded Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls (HS&amp;S), which grew to become one of the top high-tech advertising agencies in [[North Carolina]], and then in [[Silicon Valley]]. Searls' consultancy, The Searls Group, was spun out of HS&amp;S in the early 1990s. He is a frequent speaker at business and industry events, under the auspices of The Searls Group.

Searls is a 1969 graduate of [[Guilford College]]. While Searls' permanent home is in Santa Barbara, he and his family currently live most of the year near his work at Harvard.

Searls' journalism career began in 1971, when he worked as an editor and photographer for ''Wayne Today'' in New Jersey. In recent years his photographic work consists of pushing as many shots as possible into the public domain, through permissive [[Creative Commons]] licensing for a batch of photos on [[Flickr]] that now total more than 41,000 on his own site alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/ Doc Searls Flickr photos], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt; (He also posts on three other sites: two for the Berkman Center and one for ''Linux Journal''.) A large percentage of those are shot out the windows of commercial aircraft. There are about 300 of his photos that now appear in Wikimedia Commons (none of which he put there).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Commons |url= http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=default&amp;search=doc+searls&amp;fulltext=Search|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these also illustrate articles in Wikipedia as well.

His photos have also appeared in many books, magazines and other media, including NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. There Searls' ice crystal photos served as key elements for the network's coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157613918962531/ Doc Searls Ice Crystal Photos], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt; (Searls ran in the credits as a member of the design team.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157623323934755/ Doc Searls Photos used by NBC], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44913">'''E-services''' (electronic services) are services which use of [[Information and communication technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are- service provider, service receiver and the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service. Internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Rowley, J. (2006) An analysis of the e-service literature: towards a research agenda. Internet Research, 16 (3), 339-359&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government,&lt;ref&gt;Alasem, A. (2009). An Overview of e-Government Metadata Standards and Initiatives based on Dublin Core. Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7(1), 1 – 10&lt;/ref&gt; the term ‘[[E-Government]]’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, M., Codagnone, C. and Janssen, M. (2008) “Future of e-Government Research: 13 research themes identified in the eGovRTD2020 project’. Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, USA&lt;/ref&gt; E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lӧfstedt, U. (2005) ‘Assessment of current research and some proposals for future direction’, International Journal of Public IS&lt;/ref&gt;

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

"E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible." (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of E-service ==
Lu (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing [[Customer knowledge]]

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are

E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or [NGO|non-government organizations] (NGOs) (private sector).

E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side). The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix “public”: Public e-services. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of “e-Service” in both domains of e-government and [[e-business]].[example:[https://web.archive.org/web/20180125141728/http://eserviceforyou.com/] www.eserviceforyou.com]

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to – Data layer (data sources), processing layers (customer service systems, management systems, data warehouse systems, integrated customer content systems), exchange layer ([[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise Application Integration]]– EAI), interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring [[service quality]] and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The [[SERVQUAL]]- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The [[LIRNEasia]] study on benchmarking national telecom regulator websites focuses on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned here. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of [[information society]] reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by these agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==E-service cost factor==
Some major cost factors are (Lu, 2001):&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer
satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt;

* Security concerns
* legal issues
* Training; and
* Rapid technology changes

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ndou, V.(2004)E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and Challenges, EJISDC 18, 1, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Aurigi, A. (1997) Virtual Cities, Social Polarisation, and the Crisis in Urban Public Space, Journal of Urban Technology, 4, 1, 19-52&lt;/ref&gt;

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A.B., Juillet, L., Paquet, G. and Roy, J. (2001) E-Governance and Government Online in Canada: Partnerships, People and Prospects, Government Information Quarterly,18, 93-104.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services in Bangladesh===
Bangladesh first e-service system is National E-Service System ([http://www.eservice.gov.bd/[ NESS]]) and 2nd e-Service For you [http://eserviceforyou.com/[eserviceforyou.com]]. 

===E-services in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent’s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Mawangi, W.(2006) The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: the case of Rwanda, Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research, May 21–24, 2006, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;van Brakel, P.A.(2009) Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications, Port Elizabeth, 2–4 September&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. &amp; Yen, D. C. 2006. e-Government: evolving relationship of citizens and government, domestic, and international development. Government Information Quarterly, 23(2): 207-235.)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the [http://www.gov.za/  Batho Pele portal], [[Sars efiling|SARS e-filing]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405043644/http://www.enatis.com/  e-Natis system], electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor ([http://www.mscmalaysia.my/  MSC]) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad ([http://www.tnb.com.my TNB]) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100529003757/http://www.tm.net.my/  TM]) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one’s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234322/http://www.elx.gov.my/  ELX])is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184753/http://www.mohr.gov.my/ MOHR]), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

[http://www.esyariah.gov.my/  e-Syariah] is the seventh project under the Electronic Government flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). A case management system that integrates the processes related to management of cases for the Syariah Courts.

== Examples of E-services in Established Countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. [[Government 2.0]] (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/a-citizens-guide-to-open-government-e-government-and-government-2-0/|title=A Citizen's Guide to Open Government, E-Government, and Government 2.0|last=Harper|first=Logan|date=June 10, 2013|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov|title=USA.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-commerce]] is another growing E-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. [[Amazon.com]] is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion.

=== E-services in China ===
China’s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|title=China Gets the E-Gov Love Bug|last=Sharwood|first=Simon|date=September 15, 2016|website=The Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916031541/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China’s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “[[Internet Plus]].” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as [[Zhongguancun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2015-07/04/content_35980397.htm|title='Internet Plus' action plan unveiled|last=Xinhua|first=|date=July 4, 2015|website=China.org|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording)  This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased E-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/chinas-consumers-outspending-americans-and-british-online-2398441519.html|title=Chinese E-Commerce Boom — Bigger Than US, UK Combined|last=Vavra|first=Shannon|date=May 8, 2017|website=axios.com|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html?cid=PS_01_50_07_00_01_15_01&amp;mkwid=uui8CuV3|title=The Rise of China's New Consumer Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Goldman Sachs|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is China’s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion. Its services are globally available in Russia and Brazil through [[AliExpress]]. [[Tencent]] is another internet company with an annual revenue income of $16 billion. Tencent is used mainly for instant messaging but has other applications as well including mobile games and other digital content. By the end of 2015, Tencent’s [[WeChat]] messaging app reached around 700 million users. The biggest competitor for Tencent is Facebook’s [[WhatsApp]]. [[Baidu]] Is the most visited website in the country and it is used as a search engine and has an annual revenue of $10 billion. In March 2016, there were roughly 663 million users. [[Google]] challenges Baidu as the major internet search engines in the world. Huawei is a tech company that produces phones, tablets, and develops the equipment used in fixed-line networks. [[Huawei]] has an annual revenue income of $61 billion. It is currently located throughout 100 countries worldwide and in 2015, it filed 3,898 patent applications, more than any other country in the world. The biggest competitors to Huawei is Apple and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/technology/china-tech-behemoths/index.html|title=Meet China's Tech Behemoths|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|date=May 17, 2016|website=CNN|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Sheth., J.N., Sharma, A., (2007). E-Services: A framework for growth.  Journal of Value Chain Management, 1(1/2)&lt;/ref&gt; identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* [[Internet fraud|Fraud]] on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* [[Internet privacy|Privacy]] due the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, the access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. Possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is of privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations.  For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles.  Possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heiner and lyer (2007) E-Service opportunities and Threats, Journal of value chain management, 1, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery ; one worth noting effort is Rowley’s study (2006)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Philip F. (2009). User Acceptance of Emergency Alert Technology: A Case Study. Proceedings of the 6th International ISCRAM Conference – Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.J. (2003). Usability of E-Government Web Sites for People with Disabilities, In Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03), IEEE Computer Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, P.T. Assessing Section 508 compliance on federal e-government Web sites: A multi-method, user-centered evaluation of accessibility for persons with disabilities. Government Information Quarterly 23 (2006) 169–190&lt;/ref&gt; who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site …Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Grönlund, Å., Hatakka, M. and Ask, A. (2007) ‘ Inclusion in the E-Service Society – Investigating Administrative Literacy Requirements for Using E-Services’. 6th International Conference (EGOV 2007, Regensburg, Germany), 4656&lt;/ref&gt; for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Bannister F. (2007). The curse of the benchmark: an assessment of the validity and value of e-government comparisons, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 73 (2), 171-188&lt;/ref&gt; “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
[[Digital divide]] is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, N; Gil-García, J ; Ferro, E (2009). Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature. Government Information Quarterly, 26(2009), 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites."

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or [[e-readiness]]. According to by Shalini (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Shalini, R. (2009). Are Mauritians ready for e-Government services?. Government Information Quarterly 26 (2009) 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; “the results of the research project reveal that a high [http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_2007_e_readiness_rankings&amp;rf=0|e-readiness index] may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question's priorities and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSINC International (2002). E-Readiness Guide. Available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/evaluation/e-readiness/geosinc01042002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”&lt;ref&gt;Codagnone, C.  Undheim T.A (2008).  Benchmarking eGovernment: tools, theory, and practice. European Journal of ePractice. Nº 4 • August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services.  According to the GAO report&lt;ref&gt;GAO.(2002). E-Government: Proposal addresses Critical Challenges. U.S General Accounting Office, Govt of the USA&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government.The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large,  Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, K, Melin, f, Lindgren, I, (2009) DEVELOPING PUBLIC E-SERVICES FOR SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS – A MULTIFACETED VIEW OF THE NEEDS FOR AN E-SERVICE. 17th European Conference on Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the [[stakeholder theory]] in public settings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, H. J. (2001). Applying stakeholder theory to e-government: Benefits and Limits. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C.,  Deshazo, R. &amp; Eck, D. V. (2001) "Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities". Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), 18(4), 293 - 307&lt;/ref&gt;

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=211245 Open Learning - OpenLearn - Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees' computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance.&lt;ref&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002). Strategic Management of Information systems and Technology in an e-World”, Proceedings of the 21st IT Conference, Sri Lanka, pp103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002b) “e-Governance in Asia Pacific”, Proceedings of the International Conference on Governance in Asia, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==E-service awards==
The benefits of e-services in advancing businesses efficiency and in promoting good governance are huge; recognizing the importance of these benefits has resulted in number of international awards that are dedicated to recognize the best designed e-services. In the section, we will provide description of some international awards

An '''electric boiler''' is a device that uses electrical energy to boil water. 

==Types==
Small [[electric water boiler]]s are portable household appliances, used to prepare hot beverages or other food items.  They may provide a reservoir of hot water to be kept at a fixed temperature or to allow tea to be steeped at a controlled temperature. They are manually filled with water every time hot water is desired. 

An [[electric steam boiler]] is intended to produce steam for process industry or other uses, such as drying, heat treating, and others. These are generally permanently installed systems with connections to a water supply and piping to transport product steam to the point of use. In places where electric power is relatively low cost compared to fossil fuels, it may be economically practical to use an electric boiler for steam central heating. For example, in Winnipeg, Canada, during the Second World War, large central electric steam boilers were used for a [[district heating]] system, using surplus [[hydroelectric power]].  The intent was to conserve coal fuel for more critical wartime needs. 
 
Electric boilers may rely on [[immersion heater]] resistance heating elements to heat water, or may use electric current passing directly through the water as an [[electrode boiler]]. &lt;ref name=CM12&gt; Carey Merritt, ''Process Steam Systems: A Practical Guide for Operators, Maintainers, and Designers'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015,{{ISBN|1118877187}}, pages 78-80 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Control and safety==
Even the tabletop appliance will have a control switch or at least an over temperature cut out to prevent fire if the appliance is started with no water in it. Larger installations have more elaborate controls to ensure that sufficient water supply is available to prevent burn out of the heating elements. These may include interlocks, pressure switches or other measures. &lt;ref name=CM12/&gt;

A boiler is a [[pressure vessel]] and industrial boilers are constructed, operated and inspected in accordance with local regulations to reduce the risk of explosion. For example, permanently installed pressure relief valves will operate if a control malfunction results in excessive pressure in the boiler. 

Normally resistance heating elements are insulated from the water going through the boiler; sensitive [[ground fault]] leakage current detection may be installed to alarm or shut off power if an insulation failure is detected.  Electrode boilers put the water supply in direct contact with the electrical supply; current collectors or other features may be provided in piping to prevent dangerous electrical hazards on connected piping. 

==Application issues==
Any dissolved minerals in the water will be concentrated by the evaporation and will tend to form a [[Fouling|scale]] coating heating surfaces. Even potable water may contain enough minerals to eventually clog or scale a boiler. Household appliances can be cleaned readily, but permanent boiler installations require control of make-up water supply chemistry to reduce scaling. 

Electric heating is generally highly efficient; since there is no stream of waste combustion gases emitting from the boiler, nearly all the purchased energy appears in the product hot water or steam in useful form.  This high efficiency even in small sizes partly offsets the generally higher cost of electric energy compared to fossil fuels. An electric boiler can be placed in operation quickly, as there is no furnace to reach high temperatures. &lt;ref name=CM12/&gt;  Environmental impact is displaced to the source of the grid electricity; however, if fossil fuel is being consumed to make electricity, overall efficiency will be lower than direct use of the fuel. 

Operationally, an electric boiler is a convenient process unit that is easy to control and that requires no space for fuel storage nor for an exhaust gas stack. There is no blower for combustion air and only minimal pumps required for operation, so the boiler is quiet. &lt;ref name=CM12/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">'''Electrical system design''' is the design of [[Electricity|electrical]] [[systems]].  This can be as simple as a [[Battery (electricity)|flashlight cell]] connected through two [[wire]]s to a [[light bulb]] or as involved as the [[space shuttle]]. Electrical systems are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation. Often the systems are combined with other systems. They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway [[rapid transit]] electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control system, and the electrical systems of each transit car. Each transit car’s electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system. Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems, such as the car climate control system.

==Design==
The following would be appropriate for the design of a moderate to large electrical system.
# A [[specification]] document is written. It probably would have been written by the customer. The specification document states in plain language and numerical detail what the customer expects. If it is well written, it will be used as a reference throughout the electrical system design.
# A [[functional specification]] (design) document that goes into more technical details may be created. It uses the specification document as its basis. Here calculations may be used or referenced to support design decisions.
# Functional diagrams may be made. These use block diagrams indicating information and electrical power flow from component to component. They are similar to the [[functional flow block diagram]]s used with computer programs.
# [[Schematic]] diagrams showing the electrical interconnections between the components are made. They may not show all the conductors and termination points. Except for [[one-line diagram]]s, this should show all the [[circuit nodes]]. One-line diagrams represent the three or four conductors of three-phase power circuits with one line.
# [[Wiring diagram]]s are sometimes made. These show and name the termination points and names of each conductor. In some systems enough information can be put onto the schematics so that wiring diagrams are not needed.
# Physically smaller systems that are built many times may use a [[cable harness]]. A full-sized to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable harness. This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses. Harnesses can be inserted into their equipment as an assembly. Cable harnesses that are reused many times, '''like''' automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery.
# A wire list is made in [[spreadsheet]] or list format. It shows the electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where. When it is printed out on paper, it is easy for the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected. The wire list contains at a minimum each wire name, terminal name, and wire model number or gage. It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers, voltage classes, conductor class (high-voltage, medium voltage, or control wiring), etc.

'''''Fundamental French''''' (français fondamental) is a list of words and [[grammar| grammatical concepts]] created in beginning of the 1950s for teaching foreigners and people part of l'Union française so that France could improve the spread of the French language. A series of investigations in the 1950s and '60s showed that a small number of words are used the same way orally and in writing in all circumstances; thus a limited number of grammatical rules were necessary for a functional language.

==Origins==
''Français fondamental'' was developed by the ''Centre d'Etude du Français Élémentaire'', which was renamed to the ''Centre de Recherche et d'Etude pour la Diffusion du Français'' (CREDIF) in 1959. It was headed by Georges Gougenheim, a linguist.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, H. H. ''Fundamental Concepts of Language Teaching: Historical and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Applied Linguistic Research''. [[Oxford University Press]]. 24 March 1983. [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6T3eo5ltFAC&amp;pg=RA15-PA55&amp;lpg=RA15-PA55&amp;dq=%22Fran%C3%A7ais+fondamental%22+language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C9zR3l6WqK&amp;sig=B_DFKqMfmX0wJsZxmyCEiNa0M6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oxl_UJHJDYm88wTbtoCgAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fran%C3%A7ais%20fondamental%22%20language&amp;f=false p. 55]. Retrieved from Google Books on October 17, 2012. {{ISBN|0194370658}}, 9780194370653.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education of France]] sanctioned and promoted it as a method of learning French. The use of ''Français fondamental'' was common in French textbooks, and especially prevalent in audiovisual learning methods used in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Decoo63&gt;Decoo, Wilfried. ''Systemization in Language Learning Models''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis US]], January 1, 2009. [https://books.google.com/books?id=O-PEsGfjHfcC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Fundamental+french%22+%22Fran%C3%A7ais+fondamental%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jXxVw2n3U0&amp;sig=0gE1wZeLL222aja9aG6sefTWEgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vhh_UL3aIYSg8gSTk4CwDw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fundamental%20french%22%20%22Fran%C3%A7ais%20fondamental%22&amp;f=false p. 63]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 17 October 2012. {{ISBN|0415361931}}, 9780415361934&lt;/ref&gt;

Gougenheim, Réné Michea, Paul Rivenc, and Aurélien Sauvageot served as researchers for the project. There are 1,475 words in the "first degree" and 1,609 words in the "second degree."&lt;ref name=Decoo63/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The core words for usage consist of around 270 grammatical words, 380 [[noun|nouns]], 200 [[verb|verbs]], 100 [[adjective|adjectives]], and 50 words for various other uses, making up a total of one thousand words. There is a second group of words which are common to all French speakers, who can use spontaneously use around 1,500 words when needed in particular circumstances.

''L'[[Academie francaise]]'' prefers to distinguish "fundamental french" and "elementary french" as it says in its page "Langue francaise - Questions courantes" (The French Language - Common Questions) in the rubric ''Nombre de mots de la langue francaise'' (number of words in the french language): "Based on frequency surveys, 'Fundamental French' and 'Elementary French' include just over 1000 to 3000 entrees respectively.

== Role and Influence ==

Fundamental French certainly had an influence, particularly in teaching the language to foreigners. But it was rejected in 1970 with the renewal of language teaching, without being replaced by a new tool. A seminar organised at ''l'École normale supérieure lettres et sciences humaines de Lyon'' in December 2005 tried to take stock of the developments that had occurred since its creation.

In a similar spirit but without the apparent affiliation, [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI) released a 10 minute Journal in easy French with a restrained and simple vocabulary (300 words) that gave the context of the events once a day. This step is analogous to that of the Voice of America, who released a program in 1959 in Special English, a form of basic English with a vocabulary restrained to 1500 words.

In [[computer engineering]], a '''hardware description language''' ('''HDL''') is a specialized [[computer language]] used to describe the structure and behavior of [[electronic circuit]]s, and most commonly, [[digital logic]] circuits.

A hardware description language enables a precise, [[Formal language|formal]] description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and [[Electronic circuit simulation|simulation]] of an electronic circuit. It also allows for the [[Logic synthesis|synthesis]] of a HDL description into a [[netlist]] (a specification of physical electronic components and how they are connected together), which can then be [[Place and route|placed and routed]] to produce the [[Mask set|set of masks]] used to create an [[integrated circuit]].

A hardware description language looks much like a [[programming language]] such as [[C (programming language)|C]]; it is a textual description consisting of expressions, statements and control structures. One important difference between most programming languages and HDLs is that HDLs explicitly include the notion of time.

HDLs form an integral part of [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) systems, especially for complex circuits, such as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, and [[programmable logic device]]s.

==Motivation==
Due to the exploding complexity of digital electronic circuits since the 1970s (see [[Moore's law]]), circuit designers needed [[digital logic]] descriptions to be performed at a high level without being tied to a specific electronic technology, such as [[CMOS]] or [[BJT]]. HDLs were created to implement [[register-transfer level]] abstraction, a model of the data flow and timing of a circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciletti|first=Michael D.|title=Advanced Digital Design with Verilog HDL|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major hardware description languages: [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]. There are different types of description in them
"dataflow, behavioral and structural".
Example of dataflow of HDL:

&lt;source lang="VHDL"&gt;
library iEEE;
use iEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use iEEE.STD_NUMERIC_STD.ALL;

entity not1 is
  port(a:in STD_LOGIC;
       b:out STD_logic);
end not1;

architecture behavioral of not1 is
begin
  b &lt;= not a;
end behavioral;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Structure of HDL==
HDLs are standard text-based expressions of the structure of electronic systems and their behaviour over time. Like [[concurrent programming]] languages, HDL syntax and semantics include explicit notations for expressing [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. However, in contrast to most software [[programming language]]s, HDLs also include an explicit notion of time, which is a primary attribute of hardware. Languages whose only characteristic is to express circuit connectivity between a hierarchy of blocks are properly classified as [[netlist]] languages used in electric computer-aided design ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]). HDL can be used to express designs in structural, behavioral or register-transfer-level architectures for the same circuit functionality; in the latter two cases the [[Logic synthesis|synthesizer]] decides the architecture and logic gate layout.

HDLs are used to write executable specifications for hardware. A program designed to implement the underlying semantics of the language statements and simulate the progress of time provides the hardware designer with the ability to model a piece of hardware before it is created physically. It is this executability that gives HDLs the illusion of being [[programming languages]], when they are more precisely classified as [[specification language]]s or [[modeling language]]s. Simulators capable of supporting discrete-event (digital) and continuous-time (analog) modeling exist, and HDLs targeted for each are available.

===Comparison with control-flow languages===
It is certainly possible to represent hardware semantics using traditional programming languages such as [[C++]], which operate on [[control flow]] semantics as opposed to [[data flow]], although to function as such, programs must be augmented with extensive and unwieldy [[Class library#Object and class libraries|class libraries]]. Generally, however, software programming languages do not include any capability for explicitly expressing time, and thus cannot function as hardware description languages. Before the introduction of [[System Verilog]] in 2002, [[C++]] integration with a [[Logic simulation|logic simulator]] was one of the few ways to use [[object-oriented programming]] in hardware verification. System Verilog is the first major HDL to offer object orientation and garbage collection.

Using the proper subset of hardware description language, a program called a synthesizer, or [[Logic synthesis|logic synthesis tool]], can infer hardware logic operations from the language statements and produce an equivalent netlist of generic hardware primitives{{jargon-inline|date=April 2014}} to implement the specified behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Synthesizers generally ignore the expression of any timing constructs in the text. Digital logic synthesizers, for example, generally use [[Clock signal|clock edges]] as the way to time the circuit, ignoring any timing constructs. The ability to have a synthesizable subset of the language does not itself make a hardware description language.

== History ==

The first hardware description languages appeared in the late 1960s, looking like more traditional languages.&lt;ref&gt;Barbacci, M. "A comparison of register transfer languages for describing computers and digital systems," Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Dept. of Computer Science,  March 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  The first that had a lasting effect was described in 1971 in [[Gordon_Bell|C. Gordon Bell]] and Allen Newell's text ''Computer Structures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=C. G.|last2=Newell|first2=A.|title=Computer Structures: Readings and Examples|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1971|isbn=0-07-004357-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text introduced the concept of [[register transfer level]], first used in the ISP language to describe the behavior of the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[PDP-8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reilly|first=E.D.|title=Milestones in computer science and information technology|page=183|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=1-57356-521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language became more widespread with the introduction of DEC's PDP-16 RT-Level Modules (RTMs) and a book describing their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=C.G.|last2=Grason|first2=J.|last3=Newell|first3=A.|title=Designing Computers and Digital Systems|publisher=Digital Press|year=1972}} ([[LCCN]] Number 72-89566)&lt;/ref&gt;
At least two implementations of the basic ISP language (ISPL and ISPS) followed.&lt;ref&gt;Barbacci, M. "The Symbolic Manipulation of Computer Descriptions:  ISPL Compiler and Simulator," Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Dept. of Computer Science, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbacci, M. "The ISPS Computer Description Language," Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Dept. of Computer Science, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;
ISPS was well suited to describe relations between the inputs and the outputs of the design and was quickly adopted by commercial teams at DEC, as well as by a number of research teams both in the USA and among its NATO allies.

The RTM products never took off commercially and DEC stopped marketing them in the mid-1980s, as new techniques and in particular [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) became more popular.

Separate work done about 1979 at the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] produced a language called KARL ("KAiserslautern Register Transfer Language"), which included design calculus language features supporting VLSI chip floorplanning{{jargon-inline|date=April 2014}} and structured hardware design. This work was also the basis of KARL's interactive graphic sister language ABL, whose name was an [[initialism]] for "A Block diagram Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=ABL specification |author1=Girardi, G. |author2=Hartenstein, R. |publisher=[[CSELT]] and [[University of Kaiserslautern]] |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABL was implemented in the early 1980s by the Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni ([[CSELT]]) in Torino, Italy, producing the ABLED graphic VLSI design editor. In the mid-1980s, a VLSI design framework was implemented around KARL and ABL by an international consortium funded by the Commission of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-first=J.|editor-last=Mermet|title=Fundamentals and Standards in Hardware Description Languages|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, design using [[programmable logic device]]s (PLDs) became popular, although these designs were primarily limited to designing [[finite state machine]]s. The work at [[Data General]] in 1980 used these same devices to design the [[Data General Eclipse MV/8000]], and commercial need began to grow for a language that could map well to them. By 1983 [[Data I/O]] introduced ABEL to fill that need.

As design shifted to VLSI, the first modern HDL, [[Verilog]], was introduced by [[Gateway Design Automation]] in 1985. [[Cadence Design Systems]] later acquired the rights to Verilog-XL, the HDL simulator that would become the de facto standard of [[Verilog simulators]] for the next decade. In 1987, a request from the U.S. Department of Defense led to the development of [[VHDL]] ([[VHSIC]] Hardware Description Language). VHDL was based on the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]], as well as on the experience gained with the earlier development of ISPS.&lt;ref&gt;Barbacci, M., Grout S., Lindstrom, G., Maloney, M.P. "Ada as a hardware description language : an initial report," Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Dept. of Computer Science, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Verilog and VHDL were used to document and simulate circuit designs already captured and described in another form (such as [[schematic]] files). HDL simulation enabled engineers to work at a higher level of abstraction than simulation at the schematic level, and thus increased design capacity from hundreds of transistors to thousands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The introduction of [[logic synthesis]] for HDLs pushed HDLs from the background into the foreground of digital design. Synthesis tools compiled HDL [[source files]] (written in a constrained format called RTL) into a manufacturable netlist description in terms of [[gate]]s and [[transistor]]s. Writing synthesizable RTL files required practice and discipline on the part of the designer; compared to a traditional schematic layout, synthesized RTL netlists were almost always larger in area and slower in performance{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. A circuit design from a skilled engineer, using labor-intensive schematic-capture/hand-layout, would almost always outperform its logically-synthesized equivalent, but the productivity advantage held by synthesis soon displaced digital schematic capture to exactly those areas that were problematic for RTL synthesis: extremely high-speed, low-power, or asynchronous circuitry.

Within a few years, VHDL and Verilog emerged as the dominant HDLs in the electronics industry, while older and less capable HDLs gradually disappeared from use. However, VHDL and Verilog share many of the same limitations: neither is suitable for analog or [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal circuit]] simulation; neither possesses language constructs to describe recursively-generated logic structures. Specialized HDLs (such as Confluence) were introduced with the explicit goal of fixing specific limitations of Verilog and VHDL, though none were ever intended to replace them.

Over the years, much effort has been invested in improving HDLs. The latest iteration of Verilog, formally known as IEEE 1800-2005 SystemVerilog, introduces many new features (classes, random variables, and properties/assertions) to address the growing need for better [[test bench]] randomization, design hierarchy, and reuse. A future revision of VHDL is also in development{{when|date=April 2014}}, and is expected to match SystemVerilog's improvements.

== Design using HDL ==

As a result of the efficiency gains realized using HDL, a majority of modern digital circuit design revolves around it. Most designs begin as a set of requirements or a high-level architectural diagram. Control and decision structures are often prototyped in [[flowchart]] applications, or entered in a [[state diagram]] editor. The process of writing the HDL description is highly dependent on the nature of the circuit and the designer's preference for coding style. The HDL is merely the 'capture language', often beginning with a high-level algorithmic description such as a C++ mathematical model. Designers often use scripting languages such as [[Perl]] to automatically generate repetitive circuit structures in the HDL language. Special text editors offer features for automatic indentation, syntax-dependent coloration, and [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]-based expansion of the entity/architecture/signal declaration.

The HDL code then undergoes a code review, or auditing. In preparation for synthesis, the HDL description is subject to an array of automated checkers. The checkers report deviations from standardized code guidelines, identify potential ambiguous code constructs before they can cause misinterpretation, and check for common logical coding errors, such as floating [[port]]s or [[short circuit|short]]ed outputs. This process aids in resolving errors before the code is synthesized.

In industry parlance, HDL design generally ends at the synthesis stage. Once the synthesis tool has mapped the HDL description into a gate netlist, the netlist is passed off to the back-end stage. Depending on the physical technology ([[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]], [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] [[gate array]], ASIC [[standard cell]]), HDLs may or may not play a significant role in the back-end flow. In general, as the design flow progresses toward a physically realizable form, the design database becomes progressively more laden with technology-specific information, which cannot be stored in a generic HDL description. Finally, an integrated circuit is manufactured or programmed for use.

== Simulating and debugging HDL code ==

{{Main|Logic simulation}}

Essential to HDL design is the ability to simulate HDL programs. Simulation allows an HDL description of a design (called a model) to pass [[Functional verification|design verification]], an important milestone that validates the design's intended function (specification) against the code implementation in the HDL description. It also permits architectural exploration. The engineer can experiment with design choices by writing multiple variations of a base design, then comparing their behavior in simulation. Thus, simulation is critical for successful HDL design.

To simulate an HDL model, an engineer writes a top-level simulation environment (called a [[test bench]]). At minimum, a testbench contains an instantiation of the model (called the device under test or DUT), pin/signal declarations for the model's I/O, and a clock waveform. The testbench code is event driven: the engineer writes HDL statements to implement the (testbench-generated) reset-signal, to model interface transactions (such as a host–bus read/write), and to monitor the DUT's output. An HDL simulator — the program that executes the testbench — maintains the simulator clock, which is the master reference for all events in the testbench simulation. Events occur only at the instants dictated by the testbench HDL (such as a reset-toggle coded into the testbench), or in reaction (by the model) to stimulus and triggering events. Modern HDL simulators have full-featured [[graphical user interface]]s, complete with a suite of debug tools. These allow the user to stop and restart the simulation at any time, insert simulator breakpoints (independent of the HDL code), and monitor or modify any element in the HDL model hierarchy. Modern simulators can also link the HDL environment to user-compiled libraries, through a defined [[Verilog#Program Language Interface (PLI)|PLI]]/[[VHDL Programming Language Interface|VHPI]] interface. Linking is system-dependent (Win32/[[Linux]]/SPARC), as the HDL simulator and user libraries are compiled and linked outside the HDL environment.

Design verification is often the most time-consuming portion of the design process, due to the disconnect between a device's [[functional specification]], the designer's interpretation of the specification, and the imprecision{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} of the HDL language. The majority of the initial test/debug cycle is conducted in the HDL ''simulator'' environment, as the early stage of the design is subject to frequent and major circuit changes. An HDL description can also be prototyped and tested in hardware — [[programmable logic device]]s are often used for this purpose. Hardware prototyping is comparatively more expensive than HDL simulation, but offers a real-world view of the design. Prototyping is the best way to check interfacing against other hardware devices and hardware prototypes. Even those running on slow FPGAs offer much shorter simulation times than pure HDL simulation.

== Design verification with HDLs ==

{{Main|Functional verification}}

Historically, design verification was a laborious, repetitive loop of writing and running simulation [[test case]]s against the design under test. As chip designs have grown larger and more complex, the task of design verification has grown to the point where it now dominates the schedule of a design team. Looking for ways to improve design productivity, the [[electronic design automation]] industry developed the [[Property Specification Language]].

In [[formal verification]] terms, a property is a factual statement about the expected or assumed behavior of another object. Ideally, for a given HDL description, a property or properties can be proven true or false using formal mathematical methods. In practical terms, many properties cannot be proven because they occupy an unbounded [[solution space]]. However, if provided a set of operating assumptions or constraints, a property checker can prove (or disprove) certain properties by narrowing the solution space.

The assertions do not model circuit activity, but capture and document the designer's intent in the HDL code. In a simulation environment, the simulator evaluates all specified assertions, reporting the location and severity of any violations. In a synthesis environment, the synthesis tool usually operates with the policy of halting synthesis upon any violation. Assertion based verification is still in its infancy, but is expected to become an integral part of the HDL design toolset.

== HDL and programming languages ==

A HDL is grossly similar to a software [[programming language]], but there are major differences. Most programming languages are inherently [[Procedural programming|procedural]] (single-threaded), with limited syntactical and semantic support to handle [[Concurrency (programming)|concurrency]]. HDLs, on the other hand, resemble [[concurrent programming]] languages in their ability to model multiple parallel processes (such as [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] and [[adder (electronics)|adders]]) that automatically execute independently of one another. Any change to the process's input automatically triggers an update in the simulator's process stack.

Both programming languages and HDLs are processed by a compiler (often called a synthesizer in the HDL case), but with different goals. For HDLs, "compiling" refers to [[logic synthesis]]; the process of transforming the HDL code listing into a physically realizable gate [[netlist]]. The netlist output can take any of many forms: a "simulation" netlist with gate-delay information, a "handoff" netlist for post-synthesis [[place and route|placement and routing]] on a semiconductor die, or a generic industry-standard [[Electronic Design Interchange Format]] (EDIF) (for subsequent conversion to a [[JEDEC]]-format file).

On the other hand, a software compiler converts the source-code listing into a [[microprocessor]]-specific object code for execution on the target microprocessor. As HDLs and programming languages borrow concepts and features from each other, the boundary between them is becoming less distinct. However, pure HDLs are unsuitable for general purpose [[application software]] development,{{Why|date=December 2018}} just as [[general-purpose programming language]]s are undesirable for modeling hardware.

Yet as electronic systems grow increasingly complex, and [[reconfigurable system]]s become increasingly common, there is growing desire in the industry for a single language that can perform some tasks of both hardware design and software programming. [[SystemC]] is an example of such—[[embedded system]] hardware can be modeled as non-detailed architectural blocks ([[black box]]es with modeled signal inputs and output drivers). The target application is written in C or C++ and natively compiled for the host-development system; as opposed to targeting the embedded CPU, which requires host-simulation of the embedded CPU or an emulated CPU.

The high level of abstraction of SystemC models is well suited to early [[Design space exploration|architecture exploration]], as architectural modifications can be easily evaluated with little concern for signal-level implementation issues. However, the threading model used in SystemC relies on [[shared memory]], causing the language not to handle parallel execution or low-level models well.

==High-level synthesis==
{{Main|High-level synthesis}}
In their level of abstraction, HDLs have been compared to [[assembly language]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are attempts to raise the abstraction level of hardware design in order to reduce the complexity of programming in HDLs, creating a sub-field called ''[[high-level synthesis]]''. 

Companies such as [[Cadence Design Systems|Cadence]], [[Synopsys]] and Agility Design Solutions are promoting [[SystemC]] as a way to combine high-level languages with concurrency models to allow faster design cycles for [[FPGA]]s than is possible using traditional HDLs. Approaches based on standard [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] (with libraries or other extensions allowing parallel programming) are found in the [[Catapult C]] tools from [[Mentor Graphics]], and the [[Impulse C]] tools from Impulse Accelerated Technologies.

[[Roller coaster]] amusement rides have origins back to ice slides constructed in 18th-century [[Russia]]. Early technology featured sleds or wheeled carts that were sent down hills of snow reinforced by wooden supports. The technology evolved in the 19th century to feature [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] using wheeled cars that were securely locked to the track. Newer innovations emerged in the early 20th century with side friction and underfriction technologies to allow for greater speeds and sharper turns. By the mid-to-late 20th century, these elements intensified with the introduction of steel roller coaster designs and the ability for them to invert riders.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The world's oldest roller coasters descended from the "[[Russian Mountains]]," which were specially constructed hills of snow &lt;ref&gt;Coker, Robert (2002). ''Roller Coasters: A Thrill Seeker's Guide to the Ultimate Scream Machines'', Metrobooks, New York. {{ISBN|1586631721}}. pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; located in the gardens of  palaces around the Russian capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], in the 18th century. This attraction  was called a ''Katalnaya Gorka'' or "sliding mountain" in Russian.  The slides were built to a height of between {{convert|70|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|0}}, had  a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports.  Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of sleds.  These slides became popular with the Russian upper class, and with  [[Catherine II of Russia]] herself, who had such mountains built in the gardens of the [[Oranienbaum Palace]] near St. Petersburg, with a pavilion next to it for drinking tea after the sliding.  "Russian mountains" remains the term for roller coasters in many languages, such as Spanish (''[[:es:Montaña rusa|la montaña rusa]]''), Italian (''[[:it:Montagne russe|montagne russe]]''), and French (''[[:fr:Montagnes russes|les montagnes russes]]''). Ironically, the Russian term for roller coaster, ''[[:ru:американские горки|американские горки]]'' (amerikanskie gorki), translates literally as "American mountains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/dict/new-enru/00/12/99.shtml  Rambler New English-Russian Dictionary: "American"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Promenades Aeriennes Jardin Baujon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Promenades-Aeriennes in Paris (1817).]]
Russian soldiers occupying Paris from 1815 through 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at Waterloo, may have introduced the Russian amusement of sledding down steep hills.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Valérie RANSON-ENGUIALE, « Promenades aériennes », Histoire par l'image [en ligne], consulté le 28 Mai 2017. URL : http://www.histoire-image.org/etudes/promenades-aeriennes &lt;/ref&gt; In July 1817, a French banker named Nicolas Beaujon opened the Parc Beaujon, an amusement park on the [[Champs Elysees]]. Its most famous feature was the ''Promenades Aériennes'' or "Aerial Strolls." &lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'', (1996). Robert Laffont, page 1051. &lt;/ref&gt; It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds. &lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;David Bennett (1998). ''Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews''.  Edison, New Jersey: Chartwell Books. 9. {{ISBN|0-7865-0885-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three-wheel carts were towed to the top of a tower,  and then released to descend two curving tracks on either side.  King [[Louis XVIII of France]] came to see the park, but it is not recorded if he tried the ride. Before long there were seven similar rides in Paris: ''Les Montagnes françaises'' (The French Mountains), ''le Delta'', ''les Montagnes de Belleville'' (The Mountains of Belleville),  ''les Montagnes américaines'' (the American Mountains), ''Les Montages lilliputiennes'', (The miniature mountains), ''Les Montagnes susses'' (The Swiss mountains)  and ''Les Montagnes égyptiennes'' (The Egyptian mountains).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the beginning, these attractions were primarily for the upper classes. In 1845 a new amusement park opened in Copenhagen, [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]], which was designed for the middle class. These new parks featured roller coasters as permanent attractions. The first permanent loop track was probably also built in Paris from an English design in 1846, with a single-person wheeled sled running through a 13-foot (4 m) diameter vertical loop. These early single loop designs were called Centrifugal Railways.  In 1887, a French entrepreneur, [[Joseph Oller]], the owner of the [[Moulin Rouge]] music  hall,  built ''Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville'' (''The Russian Mountains of Belleville'')  a permanent  roller coaster with a length of two hundred meters in the form of a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Image:Mount Pisgah plane looking up.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mount Pisgah with the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway]].]]

===Scenic railways===
In the 1850s, a mining company in [[Summit Hill, Pennsylvania]], constructed the [[Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway|Mauch Chunk]] [[gravity railroad]], a brakeman-controlled, 8.7-mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Jim Thorpe]]), [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/history/start/america.shtml Roller Coaster History: Early Years In America]. Retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.
[[Image:Thompsons Switchback Railway 1884.jpg|thumb|150px|Thompson's [[Switchback Railway]], 1884.]] 

Using this idea as a basis, [[LaMarcus Adna Thompson]] began work on a gravity [[Switchback Railway]] that opened at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sheedy |title= Icons&amp;nbsp;— In the Beginning...

"Scenic Railways" were soon found in amusement parks across the county,&lt;ref name="Urbanowicz"/&gt; with [[Frederick Ingersoll]]'s construction company building many of them in the first two decades of the 20th century.

===Growing popularity and innovations===
[[File:Coneyisland1906.jpg|thumb|[[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Loop the Loop]], an early looping roller coaster at Coney Island, 1906]]
As it grew in popularity, experimentation in coaster dynamics took off. In the 1880s the concept of a vertical loop was again explored by [[Lina Beecher]], and in 1895 the concept came into fruition with the ''[[Flip Flap Railway]]'', located at [[Sea Lion Park]] in Brooklyn, and shortly afterward with ''[[Loop the Loop (Olentangy Park)|Loop the Loop]]'' at [[Olentangy Park]] near [[Columbus, Ohio]] as well as similar coasters in [[Loop the Loop (Young's Million Dollar Pier)|Atlantic City]] and [[Loop the Loop (Coney Island)|Coney Island]]. The rides were incredibly dangerous, and many passengers suffered [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]]. Both were soon dismantled, and looping coasters had to wait for over a half century before making a reappearance.

By 1919, the first [[underfriction]] roller coaster had been developed by [[John Miller (entrepreneur)|John Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01319888&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images|website=patimg2.uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, ''[[Coney Island Cyclone|The Cyclone]]'', was opened at [[Coney Island]] in 1927. Like ''The Cyclone'', all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old [[wooden roller coaster]]s are still operational, at parks such as [[Kennywood]] near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], England. The oldest operating roller coaster is ''[[Leap-The-Dips]]'' at [[Lakemont Park]] in Pennsylvania, a [[side friction roller coaster]] built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the [[United Kingdom]] is the ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Dreamland Margate|Dreamland]] Amusement Park in [[Margate]], [[Kent]] and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened to the public in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7335519.stm Retrieved on 8th April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scenic Railway'' at [[Melbourne's Luna Park]] built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah.  The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/details.aspx?id=46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, as amusement parks generally went into a decline that resulted in less demand for new coasters. This lasted until 1972, when ''[[Racer (Kings Island)|The Racer]]'' opened at [[Kings Island]] amusement park located in what was then a part of [[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]. Designed by [[John C. Allen]], the instant success of ''The Racer'' helped to ignite a renaissance for roller coasters, reviving worldwide interest throughout the industry.

===The rise of steel===
[[Image:MatterhornBobsled2000 wb.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]], the world's first tubular [[steel roller coaster]].]]
In 1959, the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park introduced a new design breakthrough in roller coasters with the ''[[Matterhorn Bobsleds]]''. This was the first roller coaster to use a tubular [[Steel roller coaster|steel track]]. Unlike conventional wooden rails, which are generally formed using steel strips mounted on laminated wood, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, which allows designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden roller coasters are still being built along with hybrids of steel and wood.

In 1975 the first modern-day roller coaster to perform an inverting element opened: [[Corkscrew (Silverwood)|Corkscrew]], located at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], [[California]]. In 1976 the vertical loop made a permanent comeback with the [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]], California.

==History==
IDT Spectrum, Inc. and IDT Spectrum, LLC, are subsidiaries of IDT Corporation ({{New York Stock Exchange|IDT}}),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=IDT NYSE listing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AIDT Google Finance search for "NYSE:IDL"]&lt;/ref&gt; an international holding company, with interests primarily in the telecommunications and energy industries. In December 2001, IDT Corporation through its subsidiary Winstar Holdings, LLC, acquired FCC spectrum licenses and other assets from the bankruptcy estate of [[Winstar Communications]]. Winstar Holdings formed a subsidiary company, Winstar Spectrum, LLC, to hold its spectrum licenses and then caused the spectrum licenses to be assigned to it. As part of an internal corporate reorganization, in December 2004, Winstar Holdings formed IDT Spectrum, LLC, and caused Winstar Spectrum, LLC to transfer and assign to IDT Spectrum, LLC all of its FCC licenses except for six point-to-point licenses that are not used in our business. In January 2005, Winstar Holdings formed IDT Spectrum and contributed to IDT Spectrum all of its interests in IDT Spectrum, LLC, as well as other assets used in its connectivity services.&lt;ref name="edgarpro"&gt;[http://pro.edgar-online.com/ipo.aspx?ColLeft=3c2bcac1-dbf5-4776-9d3b-89001baee8d5&amp;ColRight=76baaeb6-2549-44f5-8e1d-cd700701e704&amp;cikid=683957&amp;tabIndex=2&amp;coname=IDT+SPECTRUM%2C+INC.&amp;fnid=46162&amp;ipo=1 IDT SPECTRUM, INC listing at EDGAR Pro]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Holdings==
IDT Spectrum, LLC's primary holdings include 633 spectrum licenses in the 39&amp;nbsp;GHz range, as well as an additional 16 LMDS licenses in the 28&amp;nbsp;GHz band, making it the largest single holder of 39&amp;nbsp;GHz licensed auction spectrum in the United States.&lt;ref name="FCC"&gt;[http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/results.jsp?licSearchKey=licSearcKey20121151731720&amp;curPage=2&amp;reqPage=1 FCC listing for "IDT Spectrum, LLC"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC's 39&amp;nbsp;GHz auctioned license band spectrum is primarily licensed in Economic Areas, or EAs. EAs are delineated by the Regional Analysis Division, Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce and are based on 176 metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas that serve as regional centers of economic activity, plus the surrounding counties that are economically related to these areas. On average, IDT Spectrum holds more than 500&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum in the top 200 U.S. markets (Economic Areas by population) and approximately 940&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum in the top 50 U.S. markets. IDT Spectrum's 39&amp;nbsp;GHz holdings–are contiguous across the United States (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico).&lt;ref name="edgarpro" /&gt;

In October 2010, IDT Spectrum renewed 633 of its 39&amp;nbsp;GHz licenses, which now expire in October 2020.&lt;ref name="FCC" /&gt; The majority of IDT Spectrum's 28&amp;nbsp;GHz LMDS licenses expire in October 2018.

==Use of Licenses==
Among other business activities, IDT Spectrum leases the spectrum to customers who use their own microwave equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/140/140181.html Company overview at Yahoo Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; The licenses held by IDT Spectrum are suited for high bandwidth point to point applications, including the needs of wireless operators to carry traffic from cell sites to network access points–referred to in the industry as backhaul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idt.net/about/press/story.aspx?id=23410 IDT Corporation website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The current President and CEO of IDT Spectrum is Michael Rapaport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotes.wsj.com/IDT/company-people/executive-profile/79618460?mod=WSJ_qtexec_allexec Wall Street Journal executive profile for Michael Rapaport]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infopoverty''' is the name given to the Programme and the World Conference started in 2001, in the ambit of the United Nations, aimed to fight poverty towards the application of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], Information and Communication Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketpress.info/notiziario_det.php?art=3958 Marketpress]: Pierpaolo Saporito, Presidente di OCCAM, nominato High Level Advisor dell'alleanza globale delle Nazioni Unite per le ICT e lo sviluppo . Tale nomina, confermata con lettera del Vice Segretario Generale della Nazioni Unite, Jose Antonio Ocampo, rappresenta un importante riconoscimento dell'Onu per il lavoro svolto da Occam e dal Programma Infopoverty nella lotta alla povertà attraverso le nuove tecnologie della comunicazione e dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been coined in 1998 by Arch. Pierpaolo Saporito, Founder and President of [[OCCAM - Observatory on Digital Communication]] and Gerardo Zepeda-Bermudez, Vice-President and Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qn.quotidiano.net/esteri/2011/03/26/479979-poverta_combattere_grazie_cellulare.shtml Quotidiano]: Pierpaolo Saporito, presidente di OCCAM, fondatore insieme al Parlamento Europeo e le Nazioni Unite di Infopoverty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty World Conference==
The Infopoverty World Conference is the annual international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, at the United Nations headquarters, New York,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chhavi Rajawat|Wikipedia]]: Infopoverty World Conference held at the United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Observatory of Digital Communications|OCCAM]], together with the [[European Parliament]], [[UNESCO]], and other scientific and university institutions (Infopoverty Institute at Oklahoma University).&lt;ref&gt;[http://infopoverty.ou.edu]: The Infopoverty Institute coordinates with the Observatory for Cultural and Audiovisual Communication (OCCAM) and collaborates with the international community in applying these services especially to impoverished communities around the world.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/ Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: The Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and universityThe Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and university institutions&lt;/ref&gt; At its 13th edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-ngls.org/spip.php?article4261]:Article on the 13th Infopoverty World Conference in United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service e-bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; the Infopoverty World Conference saw the participation of more than 100 international organizations,hundreds of from Governments, international and regional organizations, public and private institutions and the civil society and 63 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:The past editions of the Infopoverty World Conference enjoyed the participation of more than 100 international organizations, 10000 participants from Governments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty Programme==
The Infopoverty Programme transfers into concrete actions the orientations emerged from the Conference, realizing the ICT Villages, aimed to help the most disadvantaged communities.The first pilot projects were realized at San Ramon and San Pedro, Honduras, in cooperation with the local Ministry of Science and Technologies, following the devastation from Hurricane Mitch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218135950/http://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28074 ESA]: Whole areas were left without either electricity or telephone. Two villages, however, Saint Ramon and San Pedro were supplied with solar energy and with satellite terminals allowing broadband connection to the Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
These experiences were instrumental for the definition, thanks to the collaboration with the most important international institutions, of the ICT Village model,&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html%20 Infopoverty Programme – Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326003107/http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; validated by the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, 2005, with the creation of the Borj Touil Village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=396 Crystalweb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602051006/http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News |date=2 June 2013 }}: Infopoverty Programme al summit mondiale sulla società dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerzy Sikorski''' (born July 25, 1935) is a Polish historian, [[Copernicus|Copernicologist]], [[medievalist]], [[museologist]], author, publisher, journalist, and encyclopedist, who writes and publishes primarily in Polish.  He is a resident of [[Olsztyn]], Poland.

==Life==
===Early life===
Jerzy Sikorski was born on July 25, 1935 in [[Vilnius]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Wilno), to Anna Wołk-Lewanowicz (1914–1995) and Feliks Sikorski (1889–1980).  Five years later (1940) Sikorski's sister Maria Danuta was born.

In October 1944, during [[World War II]], Sikorski's mother Anna was arrested by the [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] along with 40 other people, when she was exposed as a courier between Vilnius' "Kedyw" and the general staff of the Polish [[Home Army]]. Early in January 1945 Sikorski's father Feliks was also arrested because he was a soldier of the 1st Polish Corps under the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in the ''Polish-Soviet War,'', but he was released after three months. Upon his release, Feliks made efforts to obtain Anna's release from prison, locate and take care of Jerzy and Maria, and reunite his family. Anna was released from prison camp in June 1946, and the family moved to Olsztyn. They chose Olsztyn based on the fact that most of the Vilnius board of education where Feliks once worked had been evacuated to Olsztyn, and Feliks could resume his position there.&lt;ref name=js2012&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2012). "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/biografia Biografia: Jerzy Sikorski – O Sobie]". ''www.jerzysikorski.pl'', Olsztyn. Accessed 2018-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Following World War II, Sikorski's mother was prevented from teaching due to political persecution. After Sikorski graduated from high school in 1953, he was repeatedly denied entry to university in spite of passing exams in [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Toruń]], and [[Poznań]]. Each time, he received the characteristic preprinted postcard with "not accepted due to lack of space".   On the advice of a Polish studies specialist teacher (Polish [[philologist]]), Janina Kirkicka, Sikorski was able to enroll in a two-year teacher's college in Olsztyn, but after two weeks the director Bolesław Wytrążek instructed Sikorski to leave the college, due the decision of the local [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in [[Olsztyn]].  Through [[:pl:Hieronim_Skurpski|Hieronim Skurpski]], who was the director at the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]] located at [[Olsztyn Castle]], Sikorski obtained employment (1954–1955) at the [[:pl:Muzeum Mikołaja Kopernika we Fromborku|Nicolas Copernicus Museum in Frombork]], which was under the patronage of the regional museum in Olsztyn.  The work at Frombork’s museum and the person of the great Polish Astronomer [[Nicolas Copernicus]], who spent most of his life in Frombork and Warmia region, made a lasting impression on Sikorski. As a result, Copernicus and ''Copernicana'' research became the dominant subject in Sikorski's lifetime work and in his professional affiliations with various research centers. Ultimately, it led to Sikorski's discovery and publication of Copernicus' resting place at Frombork’s cathedral in 1973, which was confirmed archaeologically in 2005.

In the fall of 1955 Sikorski enrolled at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], where he chose to study under professor [[:pl:Karol Górski|Karol Górski]], who among other scholarly pursuits studied and researched the life and politics of Copernicus' maternal uncle, Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]].&lt;ref name=gorski1973&gt;Górski Karol (1973). ''Łukasz Watzenrode. Życie i działalność polityczna (1447–1512).'' Wrocław 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikorski wrote his master’s thesis on Watzenrode, and   subsequently wrote his doctoral dissertation "Polish monarchy and Warmia at the end of the 15th century:  Issues in systemic-law and politics".&lt;ref name=js1978&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1978).  ''Monarchia polska i Warmia u schyłku XV wieku. Zagadnienia prawno-ustrojowe i polityczne''. Olsztyn, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing of his academic studies at the Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń in 1960, Sikorski accepted a position at the Museum of Warmia at [[Lidzbark Warmiński Castle]], where Copernicus spent at least seven years (1503–1509). Copernicus had strong ties to the city of Lidzbark, and had visited there at the invitation of his maternal uncle Bishop Lucas Watzenrode in 1495. Sikorski worked at the museum from 1961 to 1962.

Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was of substantial significance for Jerzy Sikorski's ''Copernicana'' studies in terms of the history of astronomy; as well as because the castle was a strongly fortified seat of the bishops of Warmia and the administration center of their lands  from the second half of the 14th century. At that time, Lidzbark city had one of the largest populations in Warmia, similar to [[Braniewo]].  In Lidzbark, Sikorski researched historic documents pertaining to the history of Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seashore]] ([[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]], [[Mazury]], [[Prussia]]), and its extant architectural relics, documents, and other materials relating to Nicolaus Copernicus.  Following the death of bishop Watzenrode in Toruń on March 29, 1512, Copernicus only sporadically visited Lidzbark, either as an emissary of the Warmia Chapter, or as a personal medical doctor for the successive bishops: [[:pl:Fabian Luzjański|Fabian Luzjański]] (d. 1523), [[Mauritius Ferber]] (Polish: Maurycy Ferber 1471–1537), and [[Johannes Dantiscus]] (Polish: Jan Dantyszek; 1485–1548).&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;

==Author==
An organized index of published books and articles by Sikorski is listed at [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/lista-publikacji his web portal], covering four areas of research: 1. Copernicana; 2.  Cities and castles of Prussia; 3.  Historic tradition of the region; and, 4. The History of Science.

An additional indexed list of Sikorski's complete articles and papers is available online at the [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/baza-artykulow Database of Articles] (in Polish), including two English language papers: "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/empirical-table-olsztyn-question-nicolaus-copernicus-scientific-workshop The Empirical Table of Olsztyn the Question of Nicolaus Copernicus' Scientific Workshop]", and "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/practice-bishops-burials-frombork-cathedral-and-question-grave-nicolaus-copernicus-s-uncle The Practice of Bishops' Burials in Frombork Cathedral and the Question of the Grave of Nicolaus Copernicus' Uncle Łukasz Watzenrode]".

==Journalist==
Between 1966 and 2007 Jerzy Sikorski published a number of articles in ''Mazury-Warmian Communications'' (''[[:pl:Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie]]''), on the history of [[Poland]]'s ancestral [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seashore [[Pomerania]], and the Polish regions of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. He also published articles on the life and activities of the Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=js1969&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1969). ''Wieża, dom i obserwatorium fromborskie Mikołaja Kopernika oraz jego folwarki''. Copernicana. Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie nr 4, 619-645, 1969. Contains English Summary: "''The tower, house, and observatory of Nicholas Copernicus at Frombork, and his allodiums''."  Digitized by Muzeum Historii Polski (bashum.mushp.pl).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sikorski was a member of the editorial staff at ''Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie'', and also a member of staff at ''Frombork's Commentaries'' (''Komentarze Fromborskie''), and also the substitute editor-in-chief of ''Olsztyn Yearly'' (''[[:pl:Rocznik Olsztyński|Rocznik Olsztyński]]''),&lt;ref name=js2007&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2007). ''Rocznik Olsztyński (1958-1997)'', "Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie" 2007, nr 3, s. 295-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encyclopedist==
Jerzy Sikorski published a number of short biographies of Warmian Chapter canons and members in the ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'', which is printed by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. These included biographies of Preuck Jan (1575–1631), Preuck Jerzy (d. 1556), Reich Feliks (c. 1475–1539), Sculteti Aleksander (1485–1564), Sculteti Bernard (d. 1518), and Sculteti Jan (d. 1526).

===Copernicus' Polish nationality and descent===
[[File:Locationes mansorum desertorum Nicolaus Copernicus.JPG|thumb| Nicolaus [Nicolas] Copernicus' extant manuscript, 15 pages –  ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs'')]]
Reviewing the document ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs''), which was written by Copernicus in the region of Olsztyn Castle, Olsztyn, Poland, Jerzy Sikorski discovered that, out of the 136 names of allocation of fiefs, 60 were Polish names (peasants had only first names) written in phonetically correct Polish.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|131}}  Sikorski also cites an extant document where Copernicus’ witness was Copernicus’ Polish servant: ''Wojciech Cebulski''.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|128}} These documents indicate that Copernicus spoke and wrote Polish.

Copernicus to king Sigismund I of Poland 16-XI-1520 A.jpg|thumb|Letter of Warmia Chapter to King Sigismund I of Poland, handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, November 16, 1520 ''(or. Staatliches Archivlager, Göttingen, OBA – 16 XI 1520 d); older signature: Aus D 641.'']]
In a letter to king Sigismund I of Poland handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, the administrator, chancellor, and commander in chief of the defense of Olsztyn Castle Copernicus and Warmia Canons together affirm their Polish nationality as subjects to King Sigismund I of Poland against the enemy, the German Teutonic Order. The writers say that they are willing to die defending Olsztyn Castle, Warmia, and Poland from the Teutonic Knights.  Nicolas Copernicus is directly associated with Sigismund I of Poland in the wars against the Teutonic Order, the reform of royal mints and the minting of coins, in establishing modern market economy in 16th century Poland, in direct contacts with king's personal medical doctor, with Cracow (Kraków) and the Jagiellonian University, and with the Polish Roman Catholic Church in Cracow.

Sikorski wrote "the intellectual adventure of my life were my discoveries of Copernicus’ Polish ancestry and nationality".&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fedo2015&gt;Fedoniuk B. (2015). ''Jerzy Sikorski: Kopernik był przygodą mojego życia.'' September 7, 2015,  Radio Olsztyn S.A. 2017, (https://ro.com.pl/jerzy-sikorski-kopernik-byl-przygoda-mojego-zycia/01225757).

===Copernicus’ resting place===
[[File:Jerzy Sikorski locates Copernicus’ grave in 1973.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Copernicus' 1735 and 1973 epitaphia, the altar of St. Wacław (altar of the Holy Cross), where his grave is located,&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}} and the 2010 monument to Copernicus]]

Copernicus was reportedly buried in [[Frombork Cathedral]], but archaeologists searched there in vain for centuries for his remains. Efforts to locate the remains in 1581, 1626, 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 came to nought. In 1973 Dr Jerzy Sikorski published the location of Copernicus' resting place in his book, including the photo of the Altar of Saint Wacław, today Altar of Saint Cross, with a subscription (English translation of Polish) "The remains of Mikołaj Kopernik rest unnamed next to this altar".&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}}

Sikorski's analysis of recovered chapter documents guided the Polish archaeological searches of Frombork in 2004–2005.&lt;ref name="Genetic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=js2005&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2005).

===Location of Copernicus’ observatories===

[[File:Frombork-Cathedral-Altars-Tower-Curia-4b-final.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Frombork Cathedral and defensive walls, Copernicus’ extant Canonic Curia inside the walls (''Curiae intra muros''), and the location of Copernicus’ no-longer-extant Canonic Curia outside walls (''Curiae extra muros'').]]

Sikorski discovered the location of Copernicus' Canonic Curia outside the walls of Frombork (the ''Curiae extra muros'').&lt;ref name=js1969/&gt;{{cn|reason=Need a reference to a reliable secondary source.|date=September 2018}}  The building is not extant, having been burned by Teutonic Knights on February 1, 1520, but the foundation remains. 

Sikorski searched the area nearby with instruments such as [[ground-penetrating radar]] in an effort to find Copernicus’ observatory "pavimentum", which was believed to have been nearby, but did not find it.
Sikorski was aided in the search by the notebook of Elias Olsen, who was sent by [[Tycho Brahe]] to Frombork in 1584 to use the still-extant ''pavimentum'' to obtain astronomic observations for comparison with those of Copernicus. {{As of|2011}} the ''pavimentum'' has still not been located. Its foundations may have been destroyed during extensive ground works near Copernicus’ external curia.  

Sikorski since 1973 researched and wrote on Copernicus' observatory in Olsztyn, which contains a still-extant plaster astronomical table that was used by Copernicus from 1516 to 1521.

==Recognition==
Sikorski has been awarded Polish presidential medals for his professional work as a historian and Copernicologist: the [[Gold Cross of Merit]] (1975) and Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Formal statement from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, BON – Department of Orders and Decorations, Reference: BON.0600.454.2.2017, July 27, 2017, Warsaw, addressed and forwarded by BON to Mr Artur Chojecki, the Province Region Governor of Warmia &amp; Mazury.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fifteenth anniversary of the Warmia-Mazury Business Club, the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński gave presidential orders and awards to deserving club members. On March 28, 2008, the title "Personality of the Year 2008 in Warmia and Mazury" was awarded to Jerzy Sikorski for his research into the life and science of Nicolas Copernicus, and for his 1973 discovery of Copernicus's resting place.

'''Medieval technology''' is the technology used in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] under [[Christendom|Christian rule]]. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]], the invention of vertical [[windmill]]s, [[spectacles]], [[mechanical clock]]s, and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques ([[Gothic architecture]], [[medieval castle]]s), and [[agriculture]] in general ([[three-field crop rotation]]).

The [[List of early medieval watermills|development of water mills]] from their [[List of ancient watermills|ancient origins]] was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone. By the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in [[England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-power was also widely used in [[mining]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], [[China]], and [[History of India|India]]. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though [[gunpowder]] along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.

Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted [[ship]]s with [[lateen]] sails, the [[Rudder|sternpost-mounted rudder]] and the skeleton-first [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the [[Compass|dry compass]], the [[Jacob's staff]] and the [[astrolabe]], these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning [[Age of Exploration]].

At the turn to the [[Renaissance]], [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s invention of [[Printing press|mechanical printing]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers [[Guido da Vigevano]] and [[Villard de Honnecourt]] can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as [[Taccola]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]].

== Civil technologies ==
The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).

=== Agriculture ===

'''[[Carruca]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)
[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|thumb|340x340px|Carruca (Heavy Plough )]]
A type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a [[Coulter (agriculture)]] at the bottom of the plough.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the [[plowshare]] to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ard (plough)]]''' (5th century)

An early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the [[carruca]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horse collar]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)

Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the [[yoke]] became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The rigid collar was "placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horseshoe]]s''' (9th century)

Allowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crop rotation]]''' (8th century)

Also called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Three-field system]]''' (8th century)
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|An individual grape stomping as a form of wine pressing.]]
The ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This system increases agricultural productivity over the [[Two-field system]] by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine press]]''' (12th century)

This device was the first practical means of [[Pressing (wine)]] on a plane surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The method of [[Grape stomping]] was often used as a less expensive alternative.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qanat]]''' (5th century)

An underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an [[aquifer]] or [[water well]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Folk Astronomy and Agriculture in Arabia and the Yemen|last=Varisoc|first=Daniel Martin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|year=1997|isbn=0-86078-651-X|location=Brookfield, Vermont|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.

=== Architecture and construction ===
'''[[Pendentive]] architecture''' (6th century)

A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 200s, it was in the 6th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]] that its potential was fully achieved.

'''[[Artesian well]]''' (1126)

A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.

'''[[Central heating]] through [[Underfloor heating|underfloor channels]]''' (9th century)

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman [[hypocaust]] at some places. In [[Reichenau Abbey]] a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=456–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|Rib vault]]''' (12th century)

An essential element for the rise of [[Gothic architecture]], rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older [[groin vault]].

'''[[Chimney]]''' (12th century)

The earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.

'''[[Arch bridge|Segmental arch bridge]]''' (1345)

The [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.

[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Treadwheel crane]]]]
'''[[Treadwheel crane]]''' (1220s)

The earliest reference to a [[treadwheel]] in archival literature is in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[List of historical harbour cranes|Stationary harbour crane]]''' (1244)

Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; '''Slewing cranes''' which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crane vessel|Floating crane]]'''

Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Crane (machine)|Mast crane]]'''

Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Wheelbarrow]]''' (1170s)

The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by [[Matthew Paris]] in the mid-13th century.

=== Art ===
[[File:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', oil painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1433)]]
'''[[Oil paint]]''' (by 1125)

As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]] developed the use of a stable oil mixture for [[panel painting]] around 1410.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel van Mander]] propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques. {{cite book|authorlink=Ernst Gombrich|last=Gombrich|first=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|pages=236–39|publisher=Phaidon|year=1995|isbn=0-7148-3355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clocks ===
'''[[Hourglass]]''' (1338)

Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in [[Siena]], Italy).

'''[[Clock|Mechanical clocks]]''' (13th to 14th centuries)

A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.

=== Mechanics ===
'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Compound crank]]'''

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] combines in his 1335 ''Texaurus'', a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle wheel boats]]. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metallurgy ===
'''[[Blast furnace]]''' (1150–1350)

European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Dürstel in Switzerland and the Märkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193313/http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm |date=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in some places according to recent research even before 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen.

Jh., in: Uta Lindgren (ed.): ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800-1400'', Berlin 2001 (4th ed.), pp. 249-256 (255) {{ISBN|3-7861-1748-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is considered to be an independent European development.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ludwig, Volker Schmidtchen: ''Propyläen Technikgeschichte. Metalle und Macht 1000-1600'', Berlin 1997, p.389f. {{ISBN|3-549-05633-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milling ===
{{Further|List of early medieval watermills}}
'''[[Ship mill]]''' (6th century)

The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800.
'''[[Paper mill]]''' (13th century)

The first certain use of a water-powered [[paper mill]], evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]] 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim paper making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates to 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rolling mill]]''' (15th century)

Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[tin]]. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.

'''[[Tide mill|Tidal Mill]]s''' (6th century)

The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main [[waterwheel]] types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near [[Waterford]] was powered by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tide changes at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=17, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight [[horsepower]] at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Nendrum Monastery mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Windmill|Vertical windmill]]s''' (1180s)

Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.

'''[[Trip hammer|Water hammer]]''' (12th century at the latest)

Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[Catalan forge]]s, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by [[steam hammer]]s in the 19th century.

=== Navigation ===
'''[[History of the compass#Dry compass|Dry compass]]''' (12th century)

The first European mention of the directional compass is in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''On the Natures of Things'', written in Paris around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, “Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,” ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368&lt;/ref&gt; It was either [[Compass#Question of diffusion|transmitted from China or the Arabs]] or an [[Compass#Question of independent European invention|independent European innovation]]. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Compass|Astronomical compass]]''' (1269)

The French scholar [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes in his experimental study ''Epistola de magnete'' (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1951|pp=2ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|180px|Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder]]
'''[[Rudder|Stern-mounted rudders]]''' (1180s)

The first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with [[Cog (ship)|cog]]s in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the [[age of discovery]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing, paper and reading ===
'''[[Movable type]] [[printing press]]''' (1440s)

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in [[woodblock printing]], he used separate letters (''types'') from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.

'''[[Paper]]''' (13th century)

Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see [[paper mill]]).

[[File:Friedrich Herlin, Reading Saint Peter (1466).jpg|thumb|180px|Reading [[Saint Peter]] with eyeglasses (1466)]]

'''[[Rotating bookmark]]''' (13th century)

A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text.  Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.

'''[[Spectacles]]''' (1280s)

The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.

'''[[Watermark]]''' (1282)

This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in [[Bologna]], Italy.

=== Science and learning ===

'''[[Theory of impetus]]''' (6th century)

A scientific theory that was introduced by [[John Philoponus]] who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to [[Galileo Galilei]]  who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

'''[[Arabic numerals]]''' (13th century)

The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] with his ''Liber Abaci''.

'''[[University]]'''

The first [[medieval universities]] were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1970|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry and garments ===
'''[[button|Functional button]]''' (13th century)

German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.

'''[[Loom|Horizontal loom]]''' (11th century)

Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.

'''[[Silk]]''' (6th century)

Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the [[Silk Road]] since antiquity. The technology of "silk throwing" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.

'''[[Spinning wheel]]''' (13th century)

Brought to Europe probably from India.

=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:KnightsTemplarPlayingChess1283.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar]] playing chess, ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' (1283)]]
'''[[Chess]]''' (1450)

The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.

'''[[Forest glass]]''' (c. 1000)

This type of glass uses [[wood ash]] and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Grindstone]]s''' (834)

Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]'', illustrated between 816 and 834.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hägermann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=425f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the ''[[Luttrell Psalter]]'' from around 1340.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Liquor]]''' (12th century)

Primitive forms of distillation were known to the [[Babylonia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levey |first=Martin |title=Chemistry and Chemical Technology in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=1959 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76ILAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of distillation also comes from [[Alchemy|alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|pages=57, 89|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220084813/http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Arabs]] adopted the distillation process,&lt;ref name="Gorak"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distillation: Fundamentals and Principles|page=5-10|editor=Andrzej Gorak, Eva Sorensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=9780123865489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in [[Salerno]] and [[Cologne]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Gorak" /&gt;

Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|"national" drinks]] of Europe, including  [[gin]] (England) and ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy). In 1437, "burned water" ([[brandy]]) was mentioned in the records of the [[County of Katzenelnbogen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com/begriffe.html graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com], ''Trinkglas.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Magnet]]s''' (12th century)

Magnets were first referenced in the ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'', composed between 1155 and 1160.

'''[[Mirror]]s''' (1180)

The first mention of a "glass" mirror is in 1180 by [[Alexander Neckham]] who said "Take away the lead which is behind the [[glass]] and there will be no image of the one looking in."

'''Illustrated surgical atlas''' (1345)

Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 − 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His ''Anathomia'' provides [[picture]]s of [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of [[trephination]], and depictions of the [[meninges]], [[cerebrum]], and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Di Ieva|2007|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Quarantine]]''' (1377)

Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.

'''[[Mouse trap|Rat trap]]s''' (1170s)

The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]].

'''[[Soap]]''' (9th century)

Soap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.

== Military technologies ==

=== Armour ===
'''[[Gambeson|Quilted Armour]]''' (pre 5th - 14th Century)

There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. 
Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=72|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boiled_leather|Cuir Bouilli]]''' (5th-10th Century)

Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flank|first1=Lenny|title=A History of European Armor|journal=Hidden History|date=May 24, 2016|url=https://lflank.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/a-history-of-european-armor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.

'''[[Chain mail|Chain Mail]]''' (11th-16th Century)

The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the '''[[Hauberk]]''', also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technologies|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=64|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century '''[[banded mail]]''' became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Banded_Mail_Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Banded Mail Armour Construction]]

'''[[Jazerant]]''' (11th century)

The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andre-Driussi|first1=Micheal|title=Lexicon Urthus|date=2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=0964279517|page=192|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. 

'''[[Scale Armour]]''' (12th century)

A type of '''[[Lamellar armour]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medievil Militay Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=70|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. 

[[File:KHM Wien S XIII - Jousting armour by Jörg and Lorenz Helmschmid front.jpg|thumb|180px|Jousting armor commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1494]]

'''[[Plate armour|Plate Armour]]''' (14th century)

Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Components of medieval armour]]''' that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=74|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henery|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.

=== Cavalry ===
'''[[Saddle|Arched saddle]]''' (11th century)

The arched saddle enabled mounted [[knight]]s to wield [[lance]]s underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock [[cavalry]], enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.

'''[[Spur]]s''' (11th century)

Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn his spurs" by proving his or her worthiness.

'''[[Stirrup]]''' (6th century)

Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.

=== Gunpowder weapons ===
'''[[Cannon]]''' (1324)

Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote "these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms."&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Volley gun]]'''

'''[[Gunpowder|Corned gunpowder]]''' (late 14th century)

First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Scottish bombard [[Mons Meg]]]]
'''[[Supergun]]''' (late 14th century)

Extant examples include the wrought-iron [[Pumhart von Steyr]], [[Dulle Griet]] and [[Mons Meg]] as well as the cast-bronze [[Faule Mette]] and [[Faule Grete]] (all from the 15th century).

=== Mechanical artillery ===
'''[[Trebuchet|Counterweight trebuchet]]''' (12th century)

Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the [[Crusader states]] and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf Paul E. Chevedden, "The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205183303/http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missile weapons ===
'''[[Greek fire]]''' (7th century)

An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)]]

'''[[Grenade]]''' (8th century) [[File:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]

Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]], as the Byzantine soldiers learned that [[Greek fire]], a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by [[flamethrower]]s at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. 

'''[[English longbow|Longbow]] with massed, disciplined archery''' (13th century)

Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval [[knight]] class{{dubious|date=July 2016}}. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453).

'''[[Arbalest|Steel crossbow]]''' (late 14th century)

European innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.

=== Miscellaneous ===
'''[[Combined arms]] tactics''' (14th century)

The [[battle of Halidon Hill]] 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows
. Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the [[battle of Flodden]] 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63967">'''OBD-II PIDs''' ([[On-board diagnostics]] '''Parameter IDs''') are codes used to request data from a vehicle, used as a diagnostic tool.

[[SAE International|SAE]] standard J1979 defines many OBD-II PIDs. All on-road vehicles and trucks sold in North America are required to support a subset of these codes, primarily for state mandated [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] [[vehicle inspection|inspections]]. Manufacturers also define additional PIDs specific to their vehicles. Though not mandated, many motorcycles also support OBD-II PIDs.

In 1996, light duty vehicles (less than {{convert|8500|lbs|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) were the first to be mandated followed by medium duty vehicles (between {{convert|8500|–|14000|lbs|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) in 2005.&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/obd/basic.htm |title=Basic Information {{!}} On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) |publisher=US EPA |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both required to be accessed through a standardized [[Data link connector (automotive)|data link connector]] defined by [[SAE J1962]].

Heavy duty vehicles (greater than {{convert|14000|lbs||abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) made after 2010,&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; for sale in the US are allowed to support OBD-II diagnostics through [[SAE J1939|SAE standard J1939-73]] (a round diagnostic connector) according to CARB in title 13 CCR 1971.1.  Some heavy duty trucks in North America use the SAE J1962 OBD-II diagnostic connector that is common with passenger cars, notably Mack and Volvo Trucks, however they use 29 bit CAN identifiers (unlike 11 bit headers used by passenger cars).

== Services ==
There are 10 diagnostic services described in the latest OBD-II standard SAE J1979. Before 2002, J1979 referred to these services as "modes". They are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Service (hex) !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 01|&lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show current data 
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 02|&lt;tt&gt;02&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show freeze frame data
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 03|&lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show stored Diagnostic Trouble Codes
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 04|&lt;tt&gt;04&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes and stored values
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 05|&lt;tt&gt;05&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring (non CAN only)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;06&lt;/tt&gt; || Test results, other component/system monitoring (Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring for CAN only)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;07&lt;/tt&gt; || Show pending Diagnostic Trouble Codes (detected during current or last driving cycle)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;08&lt;/tt&gt; || Control operation of on-board component/system
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 09|&lt;tt&gt;09&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Request vehicle information
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;/tt&gt; || Permanent [[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s (DTCs) (Cleared DTCs)
|}

Vehicle manufacturers are not required to support all services. Each manufacturer may define additional services above #9 (e.g.: service 22 as defined by SAE J2190 for Ford/GM, service 21 for Toyota) for other information e.g. the voltage of the traction battery in a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] (HEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape PHEV TechInfo - PIDs|url=http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Escape_PHEV_TechInfo#PIDs|work=Electric Auto Association - Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard PIDs ==
The table below shows the standard OBD-II PIDs as defined by SAE J1979. The expected response for each PID is given, along with information on how to translate the response into meaningful data. Again, not all vehicles will support all PIDs and there can be manufacturer-defined custom PIDs that are not defined in the OBD-II standard.

Note that services 01 and 02 are basically identical, except that service 01 provides current information, whereas service 02 provides a snapshot of the same data taken at the point when the last diagnostic trouble code was set. The exceptions are PID 01, which is only available in service 01, and PID 02, which is only available in service 02. If service 02 PID 02 returns zero, then there is no snapshot and all other service 02 data is meaningless.

When using Bit-Encoded-Notation, quantities like C4 means bit 4 from data byte C. Each bit is numerated from 0 to 7, so 7 is the most significant bit and 0 is the least significant bit.

=== Bitwise encoded PIDs ===
Some of the PIDs in the above table cannot be explained with a simple formula.  A more elaborate explanation of these data is provided here:

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;00&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. Each bit, from [[Most significant bit|MSB]] to [[Least significant bit|LSB]], represents one of the next 32 PIDs and specifies whether that PID is supported.

For example, if the car response is &lt;tt&gt;BE1FA813&lt;/tt&gt;, it can be decoded like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|- align="center"
! scope="col" | Hexadecimal
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;
|- align="center"
! scope="col" | Binary
| &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;

| &lt;tt&gt;09&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0E&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0F&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;14&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;15&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;16&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;17&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;18&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;19&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1A&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1B&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1D&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1E&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1F&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

So, supported PIDs are: &lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;04&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;05&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;06&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;07&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;15&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;1F&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data, labeled A B C and D.

The first byte(A) contains two pieces of information. Bit &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Most significant bit|MSB]] of byte A, the first byte) indicates whether or not the MIL (check engine light) is illuminated.  Bits &lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt; represent the number of diagnostic trouble codes currently flagged in the ECU.

The second, third, and fourth bytes(B, C and D) give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests.  Note that test '''availability''' is indicated by set (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;) bit and '''completeness''' is indicated by reset (&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;) bit.

{| class="wikitable"
! Bit
! Name

|-
| &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt;
| MIL
| Off or On, indicates if the CEL/MIL is on (or should be on)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt;
| DTC_CNT

|}

Here are the common bit B definitions, they are test based.

{| class="wikitable"
! !! Test available !! Test incomplete
|- align="center"

| &lt;tt&gt;B2&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;B6&lt;/tt&gt;

|- align="center"
! scope="row" | Misfire
| &lt;tt&gt;B0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;B4&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The third and fourth bytes are to be interpreted differently depending on if the engine is [[spark plug|spark]] [[ignition system|ignition]] (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines) or [[Diesel engine|compression ignition]] (e.g. Diesel engines). In the second (B) byte, bit 3 indicates how to interpret the C and D bytes, with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; being spark (Otto or Wankel) and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; (set) being compression (Diesel).

The bytes C and D for spark ignition monitors (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines):

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;41&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. 
The first byte is always zero. The second, third, and fourth bytes give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests. As with PID 01, the third and fourth bytes are to be interpreted differently depending on the ignition type (B3) – with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; being spark and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; (set) being compression. Note again that test '''availability''' is represented by a set (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;) bit and '''completeness''' is represented by a reset (&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;) bit.

Here are the common bit B definitions, they are test based.

==== Service 01 PID 78 ====
A request for this PID will return 9 bytes of data.
The first byte is a bit encoded field indicating which [[Exhaust gas temperature|EGT]] sensors are supported:

{| class="wikitable"
! Byte !! Description
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; || Supported EGT sensors
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt; || Temperature read by EGT11
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; || Temperature read by EGT12
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; || Temperature read by EGT13
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt; || Temperature read by EGT14
|}

The first byte is bit-encoded as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Bit !! Description
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A4&lt;/tt&gt; || Reserved
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A3&lt;/tt&gt; || EGT bank 1, sensor 4 Supported?
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A2&lt;/tt&gt; || EGT bank 1, sensor 3 Supported?
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A1&lt;/tt&gt; || EGT bank 1, sensor 2 Supported?
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt; || EGT bank 1, sensor 1 Supported?
|}

The remaining bytes are 16 bit integers indicating the temperature in degrees Celsius in the range -40 to 6513.5 (scale 0.1), using the usual &lt;math&gt;(A \times 256 + B) / 10 - 40&lt;/math&gt; formula (MSB is A, LSB is B). Only values for which the corresponding sensor is supported are meaningful.

The same structure applies to PID &lt;tt&gt;79&lt;/tt&gt;, but values are for sensors of bank 2.

==== Service 03 (no PID required) ====
A request for this service returns a list of the DTCs that have been set. The list is encapsulated using the [[ISO 15765-2]] protocol.

If there are two or fewer DTCs (4 bytes) they are returned in an ISO-TP Single Frame (SF).  Three or more DTCs in the list are reported in multiple frames, with the exact count of frames dependent on the communication type and addressing details.

Each trouble code requires 2 bytes to describe.  The text description of a trouble code may be decoded as follows.  The first character in the trouble code is determined by the first two bits in the first byte:

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt; !! First DTC character
|-
| align="center" | 00 || &lt;tt&gt;'''P'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Powertrain
|-

The two following digits are encoded as 2 bits. The second character in the DTC is a number defined by the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A5&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A4&lt;/tt&gt; !! Second DTC character
|-

|-
| align="center" | 11 || &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The third character in the DTC is a number defined by

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A3&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt; !! Third DTC character
|-
| align="center" | 0000 || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;

|-
| align="center" | 1111 || &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The fourth and fifth characters are defined in the same way as the third, but using bits &lt;tt&gt;B7&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;B4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;B3&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;B0&lt;/tt&gt;. The resulting five-character code should look something like "&lt;tt&gt;U0158&lt;/tt&gt;" and can be looked up in a table of OBD-II DTCs. Hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F), while relatively rare, are allowed in the last 3 positions of the code itself.

==== Service 09 PID 08 ====

It provides information about track in-use performance for catalyst banks, oxygen sensor banks, evaporative leak detection systems, EGR systems and secondary air system.

The numerator for each component or system tracks the number of times that all conditions necessary for a specific monitor to detect a malfunction have been encountered.
The denominator for each component or system tracks the number of times that the vehicle has been operated in the specified conditions.

The count of data items should be reported at the beginning (the first byte).

All data items of the In-use Performance Tracking record consist of two (2) bytes and are reported in this order (each message contains two items, hence the message length is 4).

=== Enumerated PIDs ===
Some PIDs are to be interpreted specially, and aren't necessarily exactly bitwise encoded, or in any scale.
The values for these PIDs are [[Enumerated type|enumerated]].

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 2 bytes of data.
The first byte describes fuel system #1.

{| class="wikitable"
! Value !! Description
|-
| align="center" | 1 || Open loop due to insufficient engine temperature
|-
| align="center" | 2 || Closed loop, using oxygen sensor feedback to determine fuel mix
|-
| align="center" | 4 || Open loop due to engine load OR fuel cut due to deceleration
|-
| align="center" | 8 || Open loop due to system failure
|-
| align="center" | 16 || Closed loop, using at least one oxygen sensor but there is a fault in the feedback system
|}

Any other value is an invalid response.

The second byte describes fuel system #2 (if it exists) and is encoded identically to the first byte.

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns a single byte of data which describes the secondary air status.

{| class="wikitable"
! Value !! Description
|-
| align="center" | 1 || Upstream 
|-
| align="center" | 2 || Downstream of catalytic converter
|-
| align="center" | 4 || From the outside atmosphere or off
|-
| align="center" | 8 || Pump commanded on for diagnostics
|}

Any other value is an invalid response.

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns a single byte of data which describes which OBD standards this ECU was designed to comply with.  The different values the data byte can hold are shown below, next to what they mean:

Any other value is reserved by ISO/SAE. There are currently no definitions for [[flexible-fuel vehicle]].

== Non-standard PIDs ==
The majority of all OBD-II PIDs in use are non-standard. For most modern vehicles, there are many more functions supported on the OBD-II interface than are covered by the standard PIDs, and there is relatively minor overlap between vehicle manufacturers for these non-standard PIDs.

There is very limited information available in the public domain for non-standard PIDs. The primary source of information on non-standard PIDs across different manufacturers is maintained by the US-based [[Equipment and Tool Institute]] and only available to members. The price of ETI membership for access to scan codes varies based on company size defined by annual sales of automotive tools and equipment in North America:

{| class="wikitable"  
|-
! Annual Sales in North America !! Annual Dues
|-
| Under $10,000,000 || $5,000
|-
| $10,000,000 - $50,000,000 || $7,500
|-
| Greater than $50,000,000 || $10,000
|}
However, even ETI membership will not provide full documentation for non-standard PIDs. ETI state:&lt;ref name=eti-faq&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some OEMs refuse to use ETI as a one-stop source of scan tool information. They prefer to do business with each tool company separately. These companies also require that you enter into a contract with them. The charges vary but here is a snapshot as of April 13th, 2015 of the per year charges:
{| class="wikitable"  
|-
|GM          || $50,000
|-
|Honda       || $5,000
|-
|Suzuki      || $1,000
|-
|BMW         || $25,500 plus $2,000 per update. Updates occur annually.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== CAN (11-bit) bus format ==
The PID query and response occurs on the vehicle's CAN bus. Standard OBD requests and responses use functional addresses. The diagnostic reader initiates a query using CAN ID 7DFh{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--what is the PID of the diagnostic reader? what is the payload 8 bytes?--&gt;, which acts as a broadcast address, and accepts responses from any ID in the range 7E8h to 7EFh. ECUs that can respond to OBD queries listen both to the functional broadcast ID of 7DFh and one assigned ID in the range 7E0h to 7E7h. Their response has an ID of their assigned ID plus 8 e.g. 7E8h through 7EFh.

This approach allows up to eight ECUs, each independently responding to OBD queries. The diagnostic reader can use the ID in the ECU response frame to continue communication with a specific ECU. In particular, multi-frame communication requires a response to the specific ECU ID rather than to ID 7DFh.

CAN bus may also be used for communication beyond the standard OBD messages. Physical addressing uses particular CAN IDs for specific modules (e.g., 720h for the instrument cluster in Fords) with proprietary frame payloads.

=== Query ===
The functional PID query is sent to the vehicle on the CAN bus at ID 7DFh, using 8 data bytes. The bytes are:
{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! 
! colspan="8" |Byte
|-
! width = 8% | PID Type
! width=22% | 0 
! width=22% | 1

| Service&lt;br&gt;01 = show current data;&lt;br&gt;02 = freeze frame;&lt;br&gt;etc.
| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 05 = Engine coolant temperature)
|colspan=5| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 55h)
|-
| Vehicle specific
| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;3
| Custom service: (e.g.: 22 = enhanced data)
|colspan=2| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 4980h)
|colspan=4| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 00h or 55h)
|}

=== Response ===
The vehicle responds to the PID query on the CAN bus with message IDs that depend on which module responded. Typically the engine or main ECU responds at ID 7E8h. Other modules, like the hybrid controller or battery controller in a Prius, respond at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the physical address the module responds to. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless ([[CAN bus]] protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).
The bytes are:
{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! 
! colspan="8" |Byte

| Custom service&lt;br&gt;Same as query, except that 40h is added to the service value. So:&lt;br&gt;41h = show current data;&lt;br&gt;42h = freeze frame;&lt;br&gt;etc.

|-
| Vehicle specific&lt;br&gt;7E8h, or 8h + physical ID of module.
| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;4to 7
| Custom service: same as query, except that 40h is added to the service value.(e.g.: 62h = response to service 22h request)
|colspan=2| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 4980h)
| value of the specified parameter, byte 0

|-
| Vehicle specific&lt;br&gt;7E8h, or 8h + physical ID of module.
| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;3
| 7Fh this a general response usually indicating the module doesn't recognize the request.
| Custom service: (e.g.: 22h = enhanced diagnostic data by PID, 21h = enhanced data by offset)
| 31h
|colspan=4| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 00h)

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to communication:

'''[[Communication]]''' &amp;ndash; purposeful activity of exchanging information and meaning across space and time using various technical or natural means, whichever is available or preferred. Communication requires a sender, a message, a medium and a recipient, although the receiver does not have to be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.

ISO 24517-1:2008 is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard published in 2008.

* Document management—Engineering document format using PDF—Part 1: Use of PDF 1.6 (PDF/E-1)

This standard defines a format (PDF/E) for the creation of documents used in [[geospatial]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing]] [[workflows]]&lt;ref name="PDF/E-ISO-Standard"&gt; [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42274 ISO 24517-1:2008 - Document management -- Engineering document format using PDF -- Part 1: Use of PDF 1.6 (PDF/E-1)]&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the PDF Reference version 1.6 from [[Adobe Systems]]. The specification also supports interactive media, including animation and 3D.

PDF/E is a subset of [[PDF]], designed to be an open and neutral exchange format for engineering and technical documentation.&lt;ref name="pdf/e-ready-guide"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091414/http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/pdfs/pdf-eready-guide-ue.pdf Creating PDF/E-ready files]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The PDF/E Standard specifies how the Portable Document Format (PDF) should be used for the creation of documents in engineering workflows.

Key benefits of PDF/E include:
* Reduces requirements for expensive &amp; proprietary software
* Lower storage and exchange costs (vs. paper)
* Trustworthy exchange across multiple applications and platforms
* Self-contained
* Cost-effective and accurate means of capturing markups
* Developed and maintained by the PDF/E ISO committee

The Standard does not define a method for the creation or conversion from paper or electronic documents to the PDF/E format.

The Committee managing ISO 24517 (PDF/E) needs subject-matter experts to assist in the development of Part 2 of the Standard.

ISO 24517 (PDF/E) was created to meet the needs of organizations who need to reliably create, exchange and review engineering documentation, however, the first part of the standard does not address 3D, video or other dynamic content, nor does it address integrated source data.

A PLMN is identified by the [[Mobile Country Code]] (MCC) and the [[Mobile Network Code]] (MNC). Each operator providing mobile services has its own PLMN. PLMNs interconnect with other PLMNs and [[Public switched telephone network]]s (PSTN) for [[Telephone|telephone communications]] or with [[internet service provider]]s for [[data]] and [[internet]] access of which links are defined as interconnect links between providers. These links mostly incorporate [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] digital transmission networks via fiber optic on land and digital microwave links.

Access to PLMN services is achieved by means of an ''[[air interface]]'' involving [[radio]] communications between [[mobile phone]]s or other [[wireless]] enabled user equipment and land-based [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] or [[base station|radio base stations]] or even fiber optic distributed SDH network

The PSTN is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks, in much the same way that the Internet is the concatenation of the world's public IP-based [[packet-switched network]]s.  It is both commercially- and government-owned.  This aggregation of [[Circuit switching|circuit-switching]] telephone networks has evolved greatly from the days of [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and in the late 20th century became almost [[Signaling System 7|entirely digital]] in nature &amp;mdash; except for the final link from the [[telephone exchange|central (local) telephone office]] to the user (the [[local loop]]).  It also extends into mobile as well as fixed telephones.

The PSTN also furnishes much of the Internet's long-distance infrastructure and, for the majority of users, the [[access network]] as well. Because [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs) pay the long-distance carriers for access to their infrastructure, and share the circuits among many users through [[packet switching]], the end Internet user avoids having to pay usage tolls to anyone other than their ISP.

The PSTN is largely governed by technical standards created by the [[ITU-T]], and uses E.163/E.164 addresses (usually called [[telephone number]]s) for addressing.  A number of large private telephone networks are not connected to the PSTN, and are used for military purposes (such as the [[Defense Switched Network]]). There are also private networks run by large companies that are linked to the PSTN, but only through controlled gateways such as [[private branch exchange]]s..**

==Specifications==
A [[GSM]] PLMN may be described by a limited set of access interfaces and a limited set of GSM PLMN connection types to support the telecommunication services described in the GSM 02-series of specifications.

PLMN is a network that is established and operated by an administration or by a recognized operating agency (ROA) for the specific purpose of providing land mobile telecommunications services to the public. A PLMN may be considered as an extension of a fixed network, e.g., the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or as an integral part of the PSTN. This is just one view-point on PLMN. PLMN mostly refers to the whole system of [[networking hardware]] and [[software]] that enables wireless communication, irrespective of the service area or service provider (cf. [[Internet backbone]]). Sometimes a separate PLMN is defined for each country or for each service provider. This systematic ambiguity (of terminological scope) also affects the "PSTN" term. Sometimes it refers to the whole circuit-switched system, while other times it is specific to each country.

PLMN is not a term specific to GSM. In fact, GSM can be treated as an example of a PLMN system. These days (as of January, 2006) many discussions are going on to form the structure of UMTS PLMN for the third-generation systems. Access to PLMN services is achieved by means of an air interface involving radio communications between mobile phones or other wireless-enabled user equipment and land-based radio transmitters or radio base stations. PLMNs interconnect with other PLMNs and PSTNs for telephone communications or with Internet service providers for data and internet access.

A public land mobile network may be defined as a number of mobile services switching center areas within a common numbering plan and a common routing plan. With respect to their functions, the PLMNs may be regarded as independent communications entities, even though different PLMNs may be interconnected through the PSTN/ISDN for the forwarding of calls or network information. The MSCs of a PLMN can be interconnected similarly to allow interaction. A PLMN may have several interfaces with the fixed network (e.g., one for each MSC). Inter-working between two PLMNs may be performed via an international switching center. The PLMN is connected via an NCP to the PSTN/ISDN. If there are two mobile service suppliers in the same country, they can be connected through the same PSTN/ISDN.

===Objectives of a GSM PLMN===
The general objective of a PLMN is to facilitate wireless communication and to interlink the wireless network with the fixed wired network. The PLMN was specified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) following up with their GSM specification. Even as times changed, the GSM PLMN objectives conceptually remained the same.

*To give access to the GSM network for a mobile subscriber in a country that operates the GSM system.
*To provide facilities for automatic roaming, locating and updating of mobile subscribers.
*To provide the subscriber a wide range of services and facilities, both voice and non voice, that are compatible with those offered by existing networks like PSTN and ISDN.

==Services==
*Bearer Services : These services give the subscriber the capacity required to transmit appropriate signals between certain access points (user-network interfaces).
*Tele Services : Provide subscriber with necessary capabilities including terminal equipment function to communicate with other subscribers.
*Supplementary Services : Modify or supplement basic telecommunication services and are offered together or in association with basic communication services.

==Architecture==
{{Tone|date=March 2014}}
GSM architecture is basically the PLMN architecture itself as the subject is GSM PLMN. Various interfaces between the GSM subsystems are to be considered, along with the signaling system and the various components (both hardware and software).

==Subsystems==
The GSM PLMN is divided into signaling network and mobile network. Each of these has various subsystems, which are grouped under three major systems: the [[Network and Switching Subsystem]] (NSS), the [[Base Station Subsystem]] (BSS), and the [[operation and support system]] (OSS).

===Operation and Support System (OSS)===
The [[operations and maintenance center]] (OMC) is connected to all equipment in the switching system and to the BSC. The implementation of OMC is called the operation and support system (OSS). The OSS is the functional entity from which the network operator monitors and controls the system. The purpose of OSS is to offer the customer cost-effective support for centralized, regional, and local operational and maintenance activities that are required for a GSM network. An important function of OSS is to provide a network overview and support the maintenance activities of different operation and maintenance organizations. End.

===Additional functional elements===
Other functional elements shown are as follows:
*Message center (MXE)&amp;mdash;The MXE is a node that provides integrated voice, fax, and data messaging. Specifically, the MXE handles short message service, cell broadcast, voice mail, fax mail, email, and notification.
*Mobile Service Node (MSN)&amp;mdash;The MSN is the node that handles the mobile intelligent network (IN) services.
*Gateway Mobile services Switching Center (GMSC)&amp;mdash;A gateway is a node used to interconnect two networks. The gateway is often implemented in an MSC. The MSC is then referred to as the GMSC.
*GSM Inter-Working Unit (GIWU)&amp;mdash;The GIWU consists of both hardware and software that provides an interface to various networks for data communications. Through the GIWU, users can alternate between speech and data during the same call. The GIWU hardware equipment is physically located at the MSC/VLR.

There are three viewpoints of interoperability between PLMN and PSTN:

#PLMN can be treated as an integral part of the PSTN, extending the services offered by the PSTN to wireless networks.
#PSTN can be treated as an integral part of PLMN, through which it facilitates call routing.
#PLMN and PSTN can be treated as two separate systems, which depend on each other or connect to each other for the purpose of call routing.

==Conclusion==
A PLMN is essential for the effective working of any wireless network, just like the need for PSTN in wireline networks. PLMN facilitates interoperation with its own subsystems in order to perform operation of the GSM (3G), LTE (4G) and 5G systems and any wired network in general.

== History and context ==

[[Electromagnetic propulsion]] designs which operate on the principle of [[reaction mass]] have been around since the start of the 20th century. In the 1960s, extensive research was conducted on two designs which emit high-velocity ionized gases in similar ways: [[ion thruster]]s that convert propellant to ions and accelerate and eject them via [[electric potential]]s, and [[plasma propulsion engine|plasma thrusters]] that convert propellant to plasma ions and accelerate and eject them via [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] currents. In the latter, plasma can be generated from an intense source of microwave or other [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] (RF) energy, and in combination with a resonant cavity, can be tuned to resonate at a precise frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A low-propellant space drive has long been a goal for space exploration, since the propellant is dead weight that must be lifted and accelerated with the ship all the way from launch until the moment it is used (see [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]). [[Gravity assist]]s, [[solar sail]]s, and [[beam-powered propulsion]] from a spacecraft-remote location such as the ground or in orbit, are useful because they allow a ship to gain speed without propellant. However, some of these methods do not work in deep space. Shining a light out of the ship provides a small force from [[radiation pressure]], i.e., using photons as a form of propellant, but the force is far too weak, for a given amount of input power, to be useful in practice.

A true zero-propellant drive is widely believed to be impossible, but if it existed, it could potentially be used for travel in many environments including deep space. Thus, such drives are a popular concept in science fiction, and their improbability contributes to enthusiasm for exploring such designs.&lt;ref name="Wired 2009"&gt;{{cite web

Conventional [[rocket engine]]s expel [[propellant]], such as when ships move masses of water, aircraft move masses of air, or rockets expel exhaust. A drive which does not expel propellant in order to produce a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]], providing thrust while being a [[closed system]] with no external interaction, would be a [[reactionless drive]]. Such a drive would violate the [[conservation of momentum]] and [[Newton's third law]], leading many physicists to believe it to be impossible, labelling the idea [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Nat Geo Peer review" /&gt; On the other hand, a drive that interacts with an external [[Field (physics)|field]] would be part of an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]], [[Field propulsion|propellantless]] but not reactionless, like a sail catching and redirecting existing winds to move a ship.

The first proposal for an RF resonant cavity thruster came from British engineer Roger Shawyer in 2001.  He invented a design with a conical cavity, calling it the EmDrive.  Guido Fetta later built the Cannae Drive based on Shawyer's concept&lt;ref name="AW&amp;ST 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired 2013" /&gt; a resonant thruster with a pillbox-shaped cavity.
Since 2008, a few physicists have tested their own models, trying to confirm results claimed by Shawyer and Fetta.  Juan Yang at [[Xi'an]]'s [[Northwestern Polytechnical University]] (NWPU) initially reported thrust from a model they built,&lt;ref name="Wired 2008"&gt;{{cite web

== Controversy and debunking ==

The plausibility of thrusters that emit no propellant, such as the EmDrive, is controversial, primarily because their operation would violate the [[conservation of momentum]].&lt;ref name="Wired 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes tucker"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of experiments using these designs has been controversial and polarized. The EmDrive first drew attention, both credulous and dismissive, when ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote about it as an "impossible" drive in 2006.&lt;ref name="New Scientist blog" /&gt; Media outlets were later criticised for misleading claims that a resonant cavity thruster had been "validated by NASA"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, responding to the ''New Scientist'' piece, mathematical physicist [[John C. Baez]] at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and Australian science-fiction writer [[Greg Egan]], said the positive results reported by Shawyer were likely misinterpretations of experimental errors.&lt;ref name="egan" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Baez|Baez]] and [[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll]] criticized this explanation, because in the standard description of vacuum fluctuations, [[virtual particle]]s do not behave as a plasma; Carroll also noted that the quantum vacuum has no "rest frame", providing nothing to push against, so it can't be used for propulsion.&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Physicists Eric W. Davis at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin and [[Sean M. Carroll]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] said in 2015 that the thrust reported in papers by both Tajmar and White were indicative of thermal effect errors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

In May 2018, researchers from the Institute of Aerospace Engineering at Technische Universität Dresden, Germany, concluded that the apparent thrust is clearly an artifact caused by Earth's magnetic field interacting with power cables in the chamber, a result that other experts agree with.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/05/nasa-emdrive-impossible-physics-independent-tests-magnetic-space-science/ NASA's 'Impossible' Space Engine Tested—Here Are the Results].

Relativistic conservation of momentum has been understood for a century and dictates that if nothing emerges from Shawyer's device then its centre of mass will not accelerate. It is likely that Shawyer has used an approximation somewhere in his calculations that would have been reasonable if he hadn't then multiplied the result by 50,000. The reason physicists value principles such as conservation of momentum is that they act as a reality check against errors of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In China, researchers working under Yang at NWPU developed their own prototype resonant cavity thruster in 2008, publishing a report in their university's journal on the theory behind such devices. In 2012 they measured thrust from their prototype, however, in 2014 they found this had been an experimental error. A second, improved prototype did not produce any measured thrust.&lt;ref name="AW&amp;ST 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang 2014" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violation of the fundamental principles of physics has drawn criticism from the scientific community, leading to various attempts to explain the apparent or observed thrust. However, to date, there is no acceptance or consensus on how or why these cavities produce thrust if they produce thrust at all.

Attempts to explain the thrust (assuming that there is thrust) generally fall into four categories:&lt;ref name="Forbes ES" /&gt;
* Measurement errors. Most theoretical scientists who have looked at the EmDrive believe this to be the likely case.
* Electromagnetic effects.
* Exhaust not being measured or taken into account.
* Speculation that our current understanding of the laws of physics are completely wrong.

=== Measurement errors ===
{{Main|Observational error}}
The simplest and most likely explanation is that any thrust detected is due to [[Observational error|experimental error]] or noise. In all of the experiments set up, a very large amount of energy goes into generating a tiny amount of thrust. When attempting to measure a small signal superimposed on a large signal, the noise from the large signal can obscure the small signal and give incorrect results. The strongest early result, from Yang's group in China, was later reported to be caused by an experimental error.&lt;ref name="Yang 2016"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Shift in center of gravity due to thermal effects ===
[[File:IR imagery of RF amplifier and heat sink.png|thumb|128px|right|Infrared image showing heating of the heat sink]]
The largest error source is believed to come from the [[thermal expansion]] of the thruster's [[heat sink]]; as it expands this would lead to a change in the centre of gravity causing the resonant cavity to move. White's team attempted to model the thermal effect on the overall displacement by using a superposition of the displacements caused by "thermal effects" and "impulsive thrust" with White saying "That was the thing we worked the hardest to understand and put in a box". Despite these efforts, White's team were unable to fully account for the thermal expansion. In an interview with ''Aerospace America'', White comments that "although maybe we put a little bit of a pencil mark through [thermal errors]... they are certainly not black-Sharpie-crossed-out."&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt;

Their method of accounting for thermal effects has been criticized by Millis and Davies, who highlight that there is a lack of both mathematical and empirical detail to justify the assumptions made about those effects.  For example, they do not provide data on temperature measurement over time compared to device displacement. The paper includes a graphical chart, but it is based on [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] assumptions about what the shapes of the "impulsive thrust" and "thermal effects" should be, and how those signals will superimpose. The model further assumes all noise to be thermal and does not include other effects such as interaction with the chamber wall, power lead forces, and tilting. Because the Eagleworks paper has no explicit model for thrust to compare with the observations, it is ultimately subjective, and its data can be interpreted in more than one way. The Eagleworks test, therefore, does not conclusively show a thrust effect, but cannot rule it out either.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

White suggested future experiments could run on a [[Cavendish balance]]. In such a setup, the thruster could rotate out to much larger angular displacements, letting a thrust (if present) dominate any possible thermal effects. Testing a device in space would also eliminate the center-of-gravity issue.
&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt;

=== Electromagnetic interaction with the vacuum chamber's wall ===
Another source of error could have arisen from electromagnetic interaction with the walls of the vacuum chamber.&lt;ref name="Hadhazy 2016" /&gt; White argued that any wall interaction could only be the result of a well-formed resonance coupling between the device and wall and that the high frequency used imply the chances of this would be highly dependent on the device's geometry. As components get warmer due to thermal expansion, the device's geometry changes, shifting the resonance of the cavity. In order to counter this effect and keep the system in optimal resonance conditions, White used a [[phase-locked loop]] system (PLL). Their analysis assumed that using a PLL ruled out significant electromagnetic interaction with the wall.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Lorentz force from power leads ===
Another potential source of error was a [[Lorentz force]] arising from power leads. Many previous experiments used cups with [[Galinstan]] metal alloy, which is liquid at room temperature, to supply electrical power to the device in lieu of solid wires. [[Martin Tajmar]] and his graduate student Fiedler characterized and attempted to quantify possible sources of error in their experiment at [[Dresden University of Technology]]. They ran multiple tests on their experimental setup, including measurements of the force along different axes with respect to the power supply current. While eliminating or accounting for many other sources of error in previous experiments, such as replacing a [[magnetic damping]] mechanism with an oil damper, less efficient but significantly less interacting with electromagnetic field, the study remained inconclusive as to the effects of electromagnetic interaction with the apparatus' power feed, at the same time noting it as possibly the most significant source of noise.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2015"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White's power setup may have been different, but their paper does not state if the connections are all coaxially aligned with the stand's rotation axis, which would be required to minimize errors from Lorentz forces, and it gives no data from equivalent tests with power into a dummy load so these influences can be compared with those seen in the Tajmar-Fiedler run.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

White's paper was published in the ''[[Journal of Propulsion and Power]]''. Marc Millis and Eric Davies who ran NASA's previous advanced propulsion project, the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] have commented that while White used techniques that would be acceptable for checking the electric propulsion of [[Hall thruster]]s, the tests were not sufficient to demonstrate that any new physics effect exists.&lt;ref name="TZF 2016" /&gt;

== Tests and experiments ==

=== Tests by inventors ===
In 2004, Shawyer reported seven independent positive reviews from experts at [[BAE Systems]], [[Astrium|EADS Astrium]], [[Siemens]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]],&lt;ref name="The Engineer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these were disputed. In a letter to ''New Scientist'', the then-technical director of EADS Astrium (Shawyer's former employer) denied this: {{quote|I reviewed Roger's work and concluded that both theory and experiment were fatally flawed. Roger was advised that the company had no interest in the device, did not wish to seek patent coverage and in fact did not wish to be associated with it in any way.&lt;ref name="newscientist-astrium-debunk" /&gt;}}

In 2011, Fetta tested a [[superconductor|superconducting]] version of the Cannae drive. The RF resonant cavity was suspended inside a liquid helium-filled [[Vacuum flask|dewar]]. The weight of the cavity was monitored by [[load cell]]s. Fetta theorized that when the device was activated and produced upward thrust, the load cells would detect the thrust as a change in weight. When the drive was energized by sending 10.5&amp;nbsp;watt power pulses of RF power into the resonant cavity, there was, as predicted, a reduction in compressive force on the load cells consistent with thrust of 8–10&amp;nbsp;mN.

None of these results have been published in the scientific literature, or replicated by independent researchers. They have been posted on their inventors' websites.&lt;ref&gt;Page is no longer available, but an archived version as of 2 November 2012 is available at archive.org: [https://web.archive.org/web/20121102082714/http://www.cannae.com/proof-of-concept/experimental-results www.cannae.com/proof-of-concept/experimental-results] (retrieved 11 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Shawyer published an article in ''[[Acta Astronautica]]'', summarising existing tests on the EmDrive. Of seven tests, four produced a measured force in the intended direction and three produced thrust in the opposite direction. Furthermore, in one test, thrust could be produced in either direction by varying the spring constants in the measuring apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a 2014 follow-up experiment (published in 2016), Yang could not reproduce the 2010 observation and suggested it was due to experimental error.&lt;ref name="Yang 2016" /&gt; In that experiment they refined their experimental setup, using a three-wire torsion pendulum to measure thrust, and tested two different power setups. In one trial, the power system was outside the cavity, and they observed a "thrust" of 8–10&amp;nbsp;mN.  In a second trial, the power system was within the cavity, and they measured no such thrust.  Instead they observed an insignificant thrust below their noise threshold of 3&amp;nbsp;mN, fluctuating between ±0.7&amp;nbsp;mN with a measurement uncertainty of 80%, with 230 W of input power.  They concluded that they were unable to measure significant thrust; that "thrust" measured when using external power sources (as in their 2010 experiment) could be noise; and that it was important to use self-contained power systems for these experiments, and more sensitive pendulums with lower [[torsion constant|torsional]] [[stiffness]].&lt;ref name="Yang 2016" /&gt;

==== EmDrive and tapered cavities ====

In July 2014, White reported tentative positive results for evaluating a tapered RF resonant cavity.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; Testing was performed using a low-thrust [[torsion pendulum]] able to detect force at the micronewton level within a sealed but unevacuated [[vacuum chamber]] (the [[RF power amplifier]] used an [[electrolytic capacitor]] unable to operate in a hard vacuum).&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; The experimenters recorded directional thrust immediately upon application of power.

Their first tests of this tapered cavity were conducted at very low power (2% of Shawyer's 2002 experiment). A net mean thrust over five runs was measured at 91.2&amp;nbsp;µN at 17&amp;nbsp;W of input power.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; The experiment was criticized for its small data set and for not having been conducted in vacuum, to eliminate thermal air currents.

The group announced a plan to upgrade their equipment to higher power levels, to use vacuum-capable RF amplifiers with power ranges of up to 125&amp;nbsp;W, and to design a new tapered cavity that could be in the 0.1&amp;nbsp;N/kW range. The test article was to be subject to independent [[verification and validation]] at [[Glenn Research Center]], the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206" /&gt; {{As of|2016}}, this validation has not happened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=40959.3320 Topic: EM Drive Developments – related to space flight applications – Thread 8], Nasa Spaceflight Forum, posts by Paul March, 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Paul March from Eagleworks made new results public, measured with a torsional pendulum in a hard vacuum: about 50&amp;nbsp;µN with 50&amp;nbsp;W of input power at 5.0×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[torr]].&lt;ref name="NBF_20150206"&gt;{{cite web

They conducted further experiments in vacuum, a set of 18 observations with 40-80W of input power.  They published the results in the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]'s peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Propulsion and Power]]'', under the title ''"Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum"''.  This was released online in November 2016, with print publication in December.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes peer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired Peer review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Motherboard Peer Review" /&gt; The study said that the system was "consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2±0.1mN/kW", and enumerated many potential sources of error.&lt;ref name="Eagleworks AIAA 2016" /&gt;

==== Cannae drive ====

White's 2014 tests also evaluated two Cannae drive prototypes.&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; One had radial slots engraved along the bottom rim of the resonant cavity interior, as required by Fetta's hypothesis to produce thrust;&lt;ref name="Cannae LLC" /&gt; another "null" test article lacked those radial slots. Both drives were equipped with an internal [[dielectric]].&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt; A third test article, the experimental control, had an RF load but no resonant cavity interior. These tests took place at atmospheric pressure.

About the same net thrust was reported for both the device with radial slots and the device without slots. Thrust was not reported for the experimental control. Some considered the positive result for the non-slotted device a possible flaw in the experiment, as the null test device had been expected to produce less or no thrust based upon Fetta's hypothesis of how thrust was produced by the device.&lt;ref name=Powell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ars&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the complete paper, however, White concluded that the test results proved that "thrust production was not dependent upon slotting".&lt;ref name="NASA AIAA 2014" /&gt;

=== Dresden University of Technology ===

In July 2015, an aerospace research group at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] (TUD) under [[Martin Tajmar]] reported results for an evaluation of an RF resonant tapered cavity similar to the EmDrive.&lt;ref name="Tajmar2015" /&gt; Testing was performed first on a knife-edge [[Weighing scale|beam balance]] able to detect force at the micronewton level, atop an antivibration granite table at ambient air pressure; then on a torsion pendulum with a force resolution of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mN, inside a vacuum chamber at ambient air pressure and in a hard vacuum at {{convert|4e-6|mbar|uPa|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

They used a conventional [[ISM band]] 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz 700 W oven magnetron, and a small cavity with a low Q factor (20 in vacuum tests).  They observed small positive thrusts in the positive direction and negative thrusts in the negative direction, of about 20&amp;nbsp;µN in a hard vacuum.  However, when they rotated the cavity upwards as a "null" configuration, they observed an anomalous thrust of hundreds of micronewtons, significantly larger than the expected result of zero thrust.  This indicated a strong source of noise which they could not identify. This led them to conclude that they could not confirm or refute claims about such a thruster. At the time they considered future experiments with better magnetic shielding, other vacuum tests and improved cavities with higher ''Q'' factors.

In 2018, the TU Dresden research team presented a conference paper summarizing the results from the most recent experiments on their upgraded test rig, which seemed to show that their measured thrust was a result of experimental error from insufficiently shielded components interacting with the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name=newscientist2018&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 25 May 2018
| work       = New Scientist
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiments, they measured thrust values consistent with previous experiments, and the thrust reversed appropriately when the thruster was rotated by 180°. However, the team also measured thrust perpendicular to the expected direction when the thruster was rotated by 90°, and did not measure a reduction in thrust when an [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] was used to reduce the power that actually entered the resonant cavity by a factor of 10,000, which they said "clearly indicates that the "thrust" is not coming from the EMDrive but from some electromagnetic interaction." They concluded that "magnetic interaction from not sufficiently shielded cables or thrusters are a major factor that needs to be taken into account for proper μN thrust measurements for these type of devices," and they plan on conducting future tests at higher power and at different frequencies, and with improved shielding and cavity geometry.&lt;ref name=tajmar2018&gt;{{Cite conference

=== Tests in space ===
In August 2016, Cannae announced plans to launch its thruster on a 6U [[cubesat]] which they would run for 6 months to observe how it functions in space. Cannae has formed a company called Theseus for the venture and partnered with LAI International and SpaceQuest Ltd. to launch the satellite. No launch date has yet been announced.&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com" /&gt;

In November 2016, the ''[[International Business Times]]'' published an unconfirmed report that the U.S. government was testing a version of the EmDrive on the [[Boeing X-37B]] and that the Chinese government has made plans to incorporate the EmDrive on its orbital space laboratory [[Tiangong-2]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes20161107"&gt;{{cite news

In December 2016, Yue Chen told a reporter at China's ''[[Science and Technology Daily]]'' that his team was testing an EmDrive in orbit, and that they had been funding research in the area for five years. Chen noted that their prototype's thrust was at the "micronewton to millinewton level", which would have to be scaled up to at least 100–1000 millinewtons for a chance of conclusive experimental results. Despite this, he said his goal was to complete validation of the drive, and then to make such technology available in the field of satellite engineering "as quickly as possible".&lt;ref name="ibtimes20161213"&gt;{{cite news

The most usual meaning is in reference to instruction manuals, and means "Read the F'ing Book" more politely rendered as "Read the Fine Book."

'''"RTFB"''' is a [[parody|parodical]] extension to the [[Internet slang]] term "[[RTFM]]" and its extension "RTFS".

"RTFB" is short for "read the fucking binary", in a similar way as "RTFM" means "read the fucking manual" and "RTFS" means "read the fucking source". While both "RTFM" and "RTFS" have legitimate uses, "RTFB" is usually intended only as a parody of them. While any user, no matter how tech-savvy, can be expected to read the [[Owners manual|manual]], and experienced [[computer programmer]]s can deduce the working logic of a [[computer program]] directly from reading its human-readable [[source code]], "RTFB" expects users to directly read the [[machine language]] code that the [[microprocessor]] executes natively. Today's microprocessors are usually so complex that, except for trivial textbook programs, this is a difficult task even for experienced programmers, and because of anti-[[reverse-engineering]] laws, may even be illegal.

RTFB has also been used meaning "Read the fucking [[Bible]]" in relation to WWJD ([[What would Jesus do?|What Would Jesus Do]]) jokes.

A more recent use, applied to members of the legislative branch, means "read the fucking bill". It is a reaction to the practice of passing massive legislation where the final bill is available for only a few hours before it is voted upon.

'''SXML''' is an alternative syntax for writing [[XML]] data (more precisely, [[XML Information Set|XML Infosets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SXML Specification |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices |last=Kiselyov |first=Oleg |volume=37 |issue=6 |year=2002 |pages=52–58|doi=10.1145/571727.571736}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as [[S-expression]]s, to facilitate working with XML data in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. An associated suite of tools{{which|date=June 2016}} implements [[XPath]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]] and [[XSLT]] for SXML in Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Kiselyov |first1=Oleg |first2=Kirill |last2=Lisovsky |title=XML, XPath, XSLT Implementations as SXML, SXPath, and SXSLT |conference=International Lisp Conference |year=2002 |url=http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/SXs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1007/3-540-36388-2_18| title = SXSLT: Manipulation Language for XML| conference = Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages| volume = 2562| pages = 256–272| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2003| last1 = Kiselyov | first1 = Oleg| last2 = Krishnamurthi | first2 = Shriram| isbn = 978-3-540-00389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are available in the [[GNU Guile]] implementation of that language.

Textual correspondence between SXML and XML for a sample XML snippet is shown below:

{|
! XML
! SXML
|-valign="top"
| &lt;source lang="xml"&gt;&lt;tag attr1="value1"
     attr2="value2"&gt;
  &lt;nested&gt;Text node&lt;/nested&gt;
  &lt;empty/&gt;
&lt;/tag&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=lisp&gt;(tag (@ (attr1 "value1")
        (attr2 "value2"))
  (nested "Text node")
  (empty))&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Compared to other alternative representations for XML and its associated languages, SXML has the benefit of being directly parsable by existing Scheme implementations. The associated tools and documentation were praised in many respects by David Mertz in his [[IBM developerWorks]] column, though he also criticized the preliminary nature of its documentation and system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=XML Matters: Investigating SXML and SSAX |first=David |last=Mertz |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204123716/http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-matters31.html |archivedate=4 December 2004 |url=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-matters31.html |date=23 October 2003 |website=[[IBM developerWorks]] |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

Take the following simple [[XHTML]] page:
&lt;source lang="html4strict"&gt;
 &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
         xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;An example page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;h1 id="greeting"&gt;Hi, there!&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;This is just an &amp;gt;&amp;gt;example&amp;lt;&amp;lt; to show XHTML &amp;amp; SXML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

After translating it to SXML, the same page now looks like this:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
 (*TOP* (@ (*NAMESPACES* (x "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml")))
  (x:html (@ (xml:lang "en") (lang "en"))
    (x:head
       (x:title "An example page"))
    (x:body
       (x:h1 (@ (id "greeting")) "Hi, there")
       (x:p  "This is just an &gt;&gt;example&lt;&lt; to show XHTML &amp; SXML."))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Each element's tag pair is replaced by a set of parentheses. The tag's name is not repeated at the end, it is simply the first symbol in the list. The element's contents follow, which are either elements themselves or strings. There is no special syntax required for XML attributes. In SXML they are simply represented as just another node, which has the special name of &lt;nowiki&gt;@&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This can't cause a name clash with an actual &lt;nowiki&gt;"@"&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, because &lt;nowiki&gt;@&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not allowed as a tag name in XML. This is a common pattern in SXML: anytime a tag is used to indicate a special status or something that is not possible in XML, a name is used that does not constitute a valid XML identifier.

We can also see that there's no need to "escape" otherwise meaningful characters like &amp; and &amp;gt; as &amp;amp;amp; and &amp;amp;gt; entities. All string content is automatically escaped because it is considered to be pure content, and has no tags or entities in it. This also means it is much easier to insert autogenerated content and that there is no danger that we might forget to escape user input when we display it to other users (which could lead to all kinds of [[cross-site scripting]] attacks or other development annoyances).

'''Short Message Peer-to-Peer''' ('''SMPP''') in the telecommunications industry is an open, industry standard protocol designed to provide a flexible data communication interface for the transfer of [[short message service|short message]] data between [[External Short Messaging Entity|External Short Messaging Entities]] (ESMEs), Routing Entities (REs) and [[Short Message service center|Message Centres]].&lt;ref name="smpp50"&gt;[http://docs.nimta.com/smppv50.pdf Short Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol Specification v5.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMPP is often used to allow third parties (e.g. [[value-added service provider]]s like news organizations) to submit messages, often in bulk, but it may be used for SMS peering as well. SMPP is able to carry [[Short Message Service|short messages]] including [[Enhanced Messaging Service|EMS]], [[voicemail]] notifications, [[Cell Broadcast]]s, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] messages including [[Wireless Application Protocol#WAP Push|WAP Push]] messages (used to deliver [[Multimedia Message Service|MMS]] notifications), [[Unstructured Supplementary Service Data|USSD]] messages and others. Because of its versatility and support for non-[[GSM]] SMS protocols, like [[UMTS]], [[IS-95]] (CDMA), [[CDMA2000]], [[IS-136|ANSI-136]] (TDMA) and [[iDEN]], SMPP is the most commonly used protocol for short message exchange outside [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]] networks.

==History==

SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) was originally designed by [[Aldiscon]], a small [[Ireland|Irish]] company that was later acquired by [[Logica]] (since 2016, after a number of changes [[Mavenir]]).  The protocol was originally created by a developer, Ian J Chambers, to test functionality of the [[short message service center|SMSC]] without using SS7 test equipment to submit messages. In 1999, Logica formally handed over SMPP to the SMPP Developers Forum, later renamed as The SMS Forum and now disbanded. The SMPP protocol specifications are still available through the website which also carries a notice stating that it will be taken down at the end of 2007. As part of the original handover terms, SMPP ownership has now returned to Mavenir due to the disbanding of the SMS forum.

To date SMPP development is suspended and SMS forum is disbanded. From SMS forum website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;July 31, 2007 - The SMS Forum, a non-profit organization with a mission to develop, foster and promote SMS (short message service) to the benefit of the global wireless industry will disband by July 27, 2007&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A press release, attached to the news, also warns that site will be suspended soon. In spite of this the site is still mostly functioning and specifications can still be downloaded (as of 31 January 2012).

The site has ceased operation according to Cormac Long, former technical moderator and webmaster for the SMS Forum. Please contact Mavenir for the SMPP specification. The files may also be available from other websites, including [https://smscarrier.com/documentation/ SMSCarrier - Documentation for SMPP APIs].

==Operation==

Contrary to its name, the SMPP uses the [[client-server model]] of operation. The [[short message service center|Short Message Service Center (SMSC)]] usually acts as a server, awaiting connections from ESMEs. When SMPP is used for SMS peering, the sending MC usually acts as a client.

The protocol is based on pairs of request/response PDUs ([[protocol data unit]]s, or packets) exchanged over [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] layer 4 ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session or [[X.25]] SVC3) connections. The [[well-known port]] assigned by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] for SMPP when operating over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] is 2775, but multiple arbitrary port numbers are often used in messaging environments.

Before exchanging any messages, a bind command must be sent and acknowledged. The bind command determines in which direction will be possible to send messages; bind_transmitter only allows client to submit messages to the server, bind_receiver means that the client will only receive the messages, and bind_transceiver (introduced in SMPP 3.4) allows message transfer in both directions. In the bind command the ESME identifies itself using system_id, system_type and password; the address_range field designed to contain ESME address is usually left empty. The bind command contains interface_version parameter to specify which version of SMPP protocol will be used.

Message exchange may be synchronous, where each peer waits for a response for each PDU being sent, or asynchronous, where multiple requests can be issued without waiting and acknowledged in a skew order by the other peer; the number of unacknowledged requests is called a ''window''; for the best performance both communicating sides must be configured with the same window size.

===Versions===

The SMPP standard has evolved during the time. The most commonly used versions of SMPP are:

* SMPP 3.3 the oldest used version (despite its limitations, it is still widely used); supports [[GSM]] only. All messages sent, generates immediate response.
* SMPP 3.4 adds [[Type-length-value|Tag-Length-Value]] (TLV) parameters, support of non-GSM SMS technologies and the [[transceiver]] support (single connections that can send and receive messages). The exchange of SMPP request and response PDUs between an ESME Transmitter and SMSC may occur synchronously or asynchronously.
* SMPP 5.0 is the latest version of SMPP; adds support for cell broadcasting

The applicable version is passed in the interface_version parameter of a bind command.

==PDU format (after version 3.4)==

The SMPP PDUs are [[Binary protocol|binary encoded]] for efficiency. They start with a header which may be followed by a body:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|- 
| style="background: black; color: white; font-weight: bold" colspan="5" | SMPP PDU
|-
| colspan="4" | PDU Header (mandatory)
| PDU Body (Optional)
|-
| Command &lt;br&gt; length || Command &lt;br&gt; Id || Command &lt;br&gt; Status || Sequence &lt;br&gt; Number || PDU Body
|- 
| 4 octets
|  colspan="4" | Length = (Command Length value - 4) octets
|}

===PDU header===

Each PDU starts with a header. The header consists of 4 fields, each of length of 4 octets:

;command_length: Is the overall length of the PDU in octets (including command_length field itself); must be ≥ 16 as each PDU must contain the 16 octet header
;command_id: Identifies the SMPP operation (or command)
;command_status: Always has a value of 0 in requests; in responses it carries information about the result of the operation
;sequence_number: Is used to correlate requests and responses within an SMPP session; allows asynchronous communication (using a [[Sliding window protocol|sliding window]] method)

All numeric fields in SMPP use the [[big endian]] order, which means that the first octet is the Most Significant Byte (MSB).

==Example==
This is an example of the binary encoding of a 60-octet ''submit_sm'' PDU. The data is shown in Hex [[Octet (computing)|octet]] values as a single dump and followed by a header and body break-down of that PDU.

This is best compared with the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the SMPP specification in order to understand how the encoding matches the field by field definition.

The value break-downs are shown with decimal in parentheses and Hex values after that. Where you see one or several hex octets appended, this is because the given field size uses 1 or more octets encoding.

Again, reading the definition of the submit_sm PDU from the spec will make all this clearer.

===PDU header===
 'command_length', (60) ... 00 00 00 3C
 'command_id', (4) ... 00 00 00 04
 'command_status', (0) ... 00 00 00 00
 'sequence_number', (5) ... 00 00 00 05

===PDU body===
 'service_type', () ... 00
 'source_addr_ton', (2) ... 02
 'source_addr_[[Numbering plan|npi]]', (8) ... 08
 'source_addr', (555) ... 35 35 35 00
 'dest_addr_ton', (1) ... 01
 'dest_addr_[[Numbering plan|npi]]', (1) ... 01
 'dest_addr', (555555555) ... 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 00
 'esm_class', (0) ... 00
 'protocol_id', (0) ... 00
 'priority_flag', (0) ... 00
 'schedule_delivery_time', (0) ... 00
 'validity_period', (0) ... 00
 'registered_delivery', (0) ... 00
 'replace_if_present_flag', (0) ... 00
 'data_coding', (3) ... 03
 'sm_default_msg_id', (0) ... 00
 'sm_length', (15) ... 0F
 'short_message', (Hello Wikipedia) ... 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 69 6B 69 70 65 64 69 61

Note that the text in the short_message field must match the data_coding. When the data_coding is 8 (UCS2), the text must be in UCS-2BE (or its extension, [[UTF-16|UTF-16BE]]). When the data_coding indicates a 7-bit encoding, each septet is stored in a separate octet in the short_message field (with the most significant bit set to 0). SMPP 3.3 data_coding exactly copied TP-DCS values of [[Data Coding Scheme|GSM 03.38]], which make it suitable only for GSM 7-bit default alphabet, UCS2 or binary messages; SMPP 3.4 introduced a new list of data_coding values:

The meaning of the data_coding=4 or 8 is the same as in SMPP 3.3. Other values in the range 1-15 are reserved in SMPP 3.3. Unfortunately, unlike SMPP 3.3, where data_coding=0 was unambiguously GSM 7-bit default alphabet, for SMPP 3.4 and higher the GSM 7-bit default alphabet is missing in this list, and data_coding=0 may differ for various [[Short message service center]]s—it may be [[ISO-8859-1]], [[ASCII]], GSM 7-bit default alphabet, [[UTF-8]] or even configurable per ESME. When using data_coding=0, both sides (ESME and SMSC) must be sure they consider it the same encoding. Otherwise it is better not to use data_coding=0. It may be tricky to use GSM 7-bit default alphabet, some [[Short message service center]]s requires data_coding=0, others e.g. data_coding=241.

== Quirks ==

Despite its wide acceptance, the SMPP has a number of problematic features:

* No data_coding for GSM 7-bit default alphabet
* Not standardized meaning of data_coding=0
* Unclear support for Shift-JIS encoding
* Incompatibility of submit_sm_resp between SMPP versions
* Using of SMPP 3.3 SMSC Delivery Receipts, especially the Message Id format in them

=== No data_coding for GSM 7-bit default alphabet ===

Although data_coding values in SMPP 3.3 are based on the [[GSM 03.38]], since SMPP 3.4 there is no data_coding value for GSM 7-bit alphabet ([[GSM 03.38]]).  However, it is common for DCS=0 to indicate the GSM 7-bit alphabet, particularly for SMPP connections to SMSCs on GSM mobile networks.

=== Not standardized meaning of data_coding=0 ===

According to SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 the data_coding=0 means ″SMSC Default Alphabet″. Which encoding it really is, depends on the type of the SMSC and its configuration.

=== Unclear support for Shift-JIS encoding ===

One of the encodings in CDMA standard C.R1001 is [[Shift-JIS]] used for Japanese. SMPP 3.4 and 5.0 specifies three encodings for Japanese (JIS, ISO-2022-JP and Extended Kanji JIS), but none of them is identical with CDMA MSG_ENCODING 00101. It seems that the Pictogram encoding (data_coding=9) is used to carry the messages in Shift-JIS in SMPP.

=== Incompatibility of submit_sm_resp between SMPP versions ===

When a submit_sm fails, the SMSC returns a submit_sm_resp with non-zero value of command_status and ″empty″ message_id.

* SMPP 3.3 explicitly states about the message_id field ″If absent this field must contain a single NULL byte″. The length of the PDU is at least 17 octets.
* SMPP 3.4 contains an unfortunate note in the SUBMIT_SM_RESP section ″The submit_sm_resp PDU Body is not returned if the command_status field contains a non-zero value.″ Then the length of the PDU is 16 octets.
* SMPP 5.0 just specifies that message_id is a mandatory parameter of the type C-Octet string of the submit_sm_resp message. According to the section 3.1.1 NULL Settings, ″A NULL string ″″ is encoded as 0x00″. The length of the PDU is at least 17 octets.

For the best compatibility, any SMPP implementation should accept both variants of negative submit_sm_resp regardless of the version of SMPP standard used for the communication.

Comment from Cormac Long 
(I worked on three versions of SMPP specification in Aldiscon/Logica and designed the ESME solution for Openmind Networks)
The original intention of error scenarios was that no body would be returned in the PDU response. This was the standard behavior exhibited on all Aldiscon/Logica SMSC and also in most of the other vendors. When SMPP 3.4 was being taken on by the WAP forum, several clarifications were requested on whether a body should be included with NACKed response and measures were taken to clarify this in several places in the specification including the submit_sm section and also in the bind_transceiver section. What should have been done was to add the clarification that we eventually added in V5.0.. that bodies are not supposed to be included in error responses. Some vendors have been very silly in their implementations including bodies on rejected bind_transmitter responses but not on bind_transceiver responses etc. The recommendation I would make to vendors.. as suggested above.. accept both variants. But its also wise to allow yourself issue NACKed submit_sm_resp and deliver_sm_resp PDUs with and without an empty body. In the case of these two PDUs, that empty body will look like a single NULL octet at the end of the stream. The reason you may need this ability to include what I call dummy bodies with NACKed requests is that the other side of the equation may be unable or unwilling to change their implementation to tolerate the missing body.

=== Message ID in SMPP 3.3 SMSC Delivery Receipts ===

The only way how to pass delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 is to put information in a text form to the short_message field; however, the format of the text is described in Appendix B of SMPP 3.4, although SMPP 3.4 may (and should) use receipted_message_id and message_state for the purpose. While SMPP 3.3 states that Message ID is a C-Octet String (Hex) of up to 8 characters (plus terminating '\0'), the SMPP 3.4 states that the id field in the Delivery Receipt Format is a C-Octet String (Decimal) of up to 10 characters. This splits SMPP implementations to 2 groups:

* Implementations using the decimal representation of an integer Message Id in the id field of the Delivery Receipt body and the hexadecimal representation of an integer Message Id in message_id and receipted_message_id fields
* Implementations using the same hexadecimal number (or even the same arbitrary string) both in message_id parameter and in the id field of the Delivery Receipt body, which strictly speaking, violates the SMPP standard

== Extensibility, compatibility and interoperability ==

Since introduction of [[Type-length-value|Tag-Length-Value]] (TLV) parameters in version 3.4, the SMPP may be regarded an [[Extensibility|extensible]] protocol. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of compatibility and [[interoperability]] any implementation should apply the Internet [[robustness principle]]: ″Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept″. It should use a minimal set of features which are necessary to accomplish a task. And if the goal is communication and not quibbling, each implementation should overcome minor nonconformities with standard:

* Respond with a generic_nack with command_status=3 to any unrecognised SMPP command, but do not stop the communication.
* Ignore any unrecognised, unexpected or unsupported TLV parameters.
* The borders of PDUs are always given by the PDUs' command_length field. Any message field must not exceed the end of PDU. If a field is not properly finished, it should be treated as truncated at the end of PDU, and it should not affect further PDUs.

Information applicable to one version of SMPP can often be found in another version of SMPP; e.g. the only way how to pass delivery receipts in SMPP 3.3 is to put information in a text form to the short_message field; however, the format of the text is described in Appendix B of SMPP 3.4, although SMPP 3.4 may (and should) use receipted_message_id and message_state for the purpose.

== Security ==
The SMPP protocol is designed on a clear-text binary protocol which needs to be considered if using for potentially sensitive information such as one-time passwords via SMS. There are, however, implementations of SMPP over secure SSL/TLS if required.

The '''social positioning method''' (SPM) studies space-time behaviour by analysing the location coordinates of [[mobile phones]] and the social characteristics of the people carrying them. The SPM methods and experiments were developed in [[Estonia]] by Positium and Institute of Geography [[University of Tartu]] during 2003-2006 (''Ahas, R. &amp; Mark, Ü. (2005). Location based services - new challenges for planning and public administration? [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4750/is_200508/ai_n17323894] Futures 37, 547-561'').

The biggest advantage of mobile positioning-based methods is that mobile phones are widespread, positioning works inside buildings, and collection of movement data is done by a third party at regular intervals. Positioning data is digital; it is easy to trace many people at the same time and it is possible to analyse movements in real time. The disadvantage of mobile positioning today is relatively low preciseness, the boom in the generation of phones with a [[GPS]] will raise positioning accuracy.

The most important problems of SPM are related to data security, as well as concerns about non-authorized personal surveillance. These problems can be solved with further development of [[location-based service]]s (LBS) and relevant legal and organisational regulation. Today mobile positioning can be applied only by obtaining participants’ personal acceptance.

[[File:Solonoid valves.jpg|thumb|Solenoid valves.]]
A '''solenoid valve''' is an [[electromechanical]] device in which the [[solenoid]] uses an [[electric current]] to generate a [[magnetic field]] and thereby operate a [[Mechanism_(engineering)|mechanism]] which regulates the opening of fluid flow in a [[valve]].

Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the electric current they use, the strength of the magnetic field they generate, the mechanism they use to regulate the fluid, and the type and characteristics of fluid they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type [[actuator|actuators]] to pivoted-armature actuators and rocker actuators. The valve can use a two-port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a [[Hydraulic manifold|manifold]].

Solenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in [[fluidics]]. Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, distribute or mix fluids. They are found in many application areas. Solenoids offer fast and safe switching, high reliability, long service life, good medium compatibility of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

== Operation ==
There are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is '''open''', then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is '''closed''', then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally open''' (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally closed'''.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201311/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 3-way and more complicated designs.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225122854/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).

Solenoid valves are also characterized by how they operate. A small solenoid can generate a limited force. If that force is sufficient to open and close the valve, then a '''direct acting''' solenoid valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required solenoid force ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the fluid pressure ''P'', and the orifice area ''A'' for a direct acting solenoid valve is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asconumatics.eu/images/site/upload/_en/pdf1/00022gb.pdf |format=PDF|page=V030-1|title=The relation ignores the dynamic head|website=Asconumatics.eu|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_s = P A = P \pi d^2 / 4&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the orifice diameter. A typical solenoid force might be {{convert|15|N|abbr=on}}. An application might be a low pressure (e.g., {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}}) gas with a small orifice diameter (e.g., {{convert|3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} for an orifice area of {{convert|0.11|in2|m2|abbr=on}} and approximate force of {{convert|1.1|lbf|N|abbr=on}}).

[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|The solenoid valve (small black box at the top of the photo) with input air line (small green tube) used to actuate a larger [[rack and pinion]] [[actuator]] (gray box) which controls the water pipe valve.]]
When high pressures and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an '''internally piloted''' solenoid valve design may be possible.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt; In such a design, the line pressure is used to generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally piloted valves are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be {{convert|80|psi|abbr=on}} and the orifice diameter might be {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

In some solenoid valves the solenoid acts directly on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit referred to as a solenoid valve. Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power for a short period of time to open it, and only low power to hold it.

A direct acting solenoid valve typically operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation time of a piloted valve depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"/&gt;

Power consumption and supply requirements of the solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/d6/d6964dee-5165-4616-b043-0eb0e7a765c6.pdf|title = Orbit 3/4 150 PSI Sprinkler|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = homedepot|publisher = Home Depot|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.omega.com/green/pdf/SVH-110.pdf|title = Omega High Pressure Solenoid Valve SVH-111/SVH-112 Series|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = omega|publisher = Omega|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.

===Internally piloted===
While there are multiple design variants, the following is a detailed breakdown of a typical solenoid valve design.

A solenoid valve has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve.  The solenoid converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve has only a small flow circuit, shown within section '''E''' of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a pilot valve).  In this example, a diaphragm piloted valve multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice.  

Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control.  A [[Spring (device)|spring]] may be used to hold the valve opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.
[[Image:Solenoid Valve.svg|thumbnail|right|360px| A- Input side&lt;BR&gt;
B- Diaphragm&lt;BR&gt;
C- Pressure chamber&lt;BR&gt;
D- Pressure relief passage&lt;BR&gt;
E- Electro Mechanical Solenoid&lt;BR&gt;
F- Output side]]

The diagram to the right shows the design of a basic valve, controlling the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state.  The water under pressure enters at '''A'''. '''B''' is an elastic diaphragm and above it is a weak spring pushing it down.  The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity '''C''' on the other side of the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.

Once the diaphragm closes the valve, the pressure on the outlet side of its bottom is reduced, and the greater pressure above holds it even more firmly closed.  Thus, the spring is irrelevant to holding the valve closed.

The above all works because the small drain passage '''D''' was blocked by a pin which is the armature of the [[solenoid]] '''E''' and which is pushed down by a spring.  If current is passed through the solenoid, the pin is withdrawn via magnetic force, and the water in chamber ''C'' drains out the passage ''D'' faster than the pinhole can refill it.  The pressure in chamber '''C''' drops and the incoming pressure lifts the diaphragm, thus opening the main valve. Water now flows directly from '''A''' to '''F'''.  

When the solenoid is again deactivated and the passage '''D''' is closed again, the spring needs very little force to push the diaphragm down again and the main valve closes. In practice there is often no separate spring; the elastomer diaphragm is molded so that it functions as its own spring, preferring to be in the closed shape.

From this explanation it can be seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work.  Should the pressure at the output, for any reason, rise above that of the input then the valve would open regardless of the state of the solenoid and pilot valve.

Solenoid valve designs have many variations and challenges.

The core or plunger is the magnetic component that moves when the solenoid is energized. The core is coaxial with the solenoid. The core's movement will make or break the seals that control the movement of the fluid. When the coil is not energized, springs will hold the core in its normal position.

The plugnut is also coaxial.&lt;!-- explain reason for plugnut; why not just one longer core. --&gt;

The core tube contains and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize the movement of the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic.  If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skinner Valve|1997|p=128}}, stating "The tube is made of non-magnetic material to make certain that the flux is directed through the plunger rather than around it."&lt;/ref&gt; In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by [[deep drawing]]. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.

The solenoid coil consists of many turns of copper wire that surround the core tube and induce the movement of the core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy.  The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.&lt;!-- explain this more. Force related to size of the gap. --&gt;
&lt;!-- AC/DC issues --&gt;

===Materials===
The valve body must be compatible with the fluid; common materials are brass, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Skinner Valve |title=Two-Way, Three-Way and Four-Way Solenoid Valves |id=Catalog CFL00897 |publisher=[[Parker Hannifin]] |year=1997 |url=http://www.surmaq.com/html/cata/parker/contr/skinner.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p.&amp;nbsp;128&lt;/ref&gt;

The seals must be compatible with the fluid.

To simplify the sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other components are often exposed to the fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. [[Stainless steel]]s can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|format=PDF|page=450f|title=States, "Internal parts in contact with fluids are of non-magnetic 300 and magnetic 400 series stainless steel."|website=Controlandpower.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matguid=d1fcb0f0cca340a4aa9068d6af5e6606|title=Crucible Steel 430F Stainless Steel|website=Matweb.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the core and plugnut.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt;

== Types ==
Many variations are possible on the basic, one-way, one-solenoid valve described above:
* one- or two-solenoid valves;
* [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] powered;
* different number of ways and positions;

==Common uses==
Solenoid valves are used in [[fluid power]] pneumatic and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic [[irrigation sprinkler]] systems also use solenoid valves with an automatic [[Controller (irrigation)|controller]]. Domestic [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwasher]]s use solenoid valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as "solenoids." 

Solenoid valves can be used for a wide array of industrial applications, including general on-off control, calibration and test stands, pilot plant control loops, process control systems, and various original equipment manufacturer applications. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcor.com/scientific-and-industrial/general-purpose-solenoid-valves/|title=General Purpose Solenoid Valves - Valcor Engineering|website=Valcor.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''specification''' often refers to a set of documented [[requirements]] to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specification is often a type of [[technical standard]].

There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word ''specification'' is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific". 

Using the term "specification" without a clear indication of what kind is confusing and considered bad practice.{{who says|date=December 2017}}

A '''requirement specification''' is a documented [[requirement]], or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 |title=Form and Style of Standards, ASTM Blue Book
|date=2012 |publisher=[[ASTM International]]
 |url=http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf
 |accessdate=5 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common early part of [[engineering design]] and [[product development]] processes, in many fields.

A '''functional specification''' is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

A '''design or product specification''' describes the features of the ''solutions'' for the Requirement Specification, referring to either a designed solution '''or''' final produced solution. It is often used to guide fabrication/production. Sometimes the term ''specification'' is here used in connection with a [[data sheet]] (or ''spec sheet''), which may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product, often published by a manufacturer to help people choose or use the products. A data sheet is not a technical specification in the sense of informing how to produce.

An "'''in-service'''" or "'''maintained as'''" '''specification''', specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and maintenance (configuration changes).

Specifications are a type of technical standard that may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations, both [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector|private]]. Example organization types include a [[corporation]], a [[consortium]] (a small group of corporations), a [[trade association]] (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its [[military]], [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]], and national laboratories and institutes), a [[professional association]] (society), a purpose-made [[standards organization]] such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements. It is common for one organization to ''refer to'' (''reference'', ''call out'', ''cite'') the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.

==Use==
In [[engineering]], [[manufacturing]], and [[business]], it is vital for [[suppliers]], purchasers, and users of materials, products, or services to understand and agree upon all requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 108. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A specification may refer to a [[Technical standard|standard]] which is often referenced by a [[contract]] or procurement document, or an otherwise agreed upon set of requirements (though still often used in the singular). In any case, it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements.

Standards for specifications may be provided by government agencies, standards organizations ([[ASTM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], [[United States Military Standard|DoD]], etc.), trade associations, corporations, and others. The following [[British standards]] apply to specifications:
*BS 7373-1:2001 Guide to the preparation of specifications &lt;ref&gt;[https://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail?pid=000000000030050705 BS 7373-1:2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

A design/product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful in every context. An item might be [[Verification and validation|verified]] to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for other, non-validated uses. The people who use the item (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify the item (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. [[Verification and Validation|Validation]] of suitability is necessary.

==Construction specifications==
===Construction Specifications in North America===
Specifications in North America form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of  building and infrastructure projects. Specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials, using code citations and published standards, whereas the drawings or Building Information Model (BIM) illustrates quantity and location of materials. The guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of [[MasterFormat]]. This  is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organizations: [[Construction Specifications Canada]] and Construction Specifications Institute based in the United States and updated every two years.

While there is a tendency to believe that "Specifications overrule Drawings" in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the Contractor. The standard AIA (American Institute of Architects) and EJCDC (Engineering Joint Contract Documents Committee) states that  the drawings and specifications are  complementary, together providing the information required for a complete facility. Many public agencies, such as the Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) state that the specifications overrule the drawings. This is based on the idea that words are easier for a jury (or mediator) to interpret than drawings in case of a dispute.

The standard listing of construction specifications falls into [[50 Divisions]], or broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction. The divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a specific material type (concrete) or a work product (steel door) of the construction work. A specific material may be covered in several locations, depending on the work result: stainless steel (for example) can be covered as a sheet material used in Flashing and Sheet Metal in Division 07; it can be part of a finished product, such as a handrail, covered in Division 05; or it can be a component of building hardware, covered in Division 08. The original listing of specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction, working from exterior to interior, and this logic is still somewhat followed as new materials and systems make their way into the construction process.

Each Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: "General", "Products" and "Execution". The MasterFormat  and Section Format &lt;ref&gt;Construction Specifications Institute&lt;/ref&gt;system can be successfully applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction. Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was specifically created for residential projects). Master specification systems are available from multiple vendors such as Arcom, Visispec, BSD, and Spectext. These systems were created to standardize language across the United States and are usually subscription based.

Specifications can be either "performance-based", whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work, "prescriptive" where the specifier states the specific criteria such as fabrication standards applicable to the item, or "proprietary", whereby the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope. In addition, specifications can be "closed" with a specific list of products, or "open" allowing for substitutions made by the Contractor. Most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and proprietrary types, naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met.

While North American specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work, [[Europe]]an ones and Civil work  can include actual work quantities, including such things as [[area]] of [[drywall]] to be built in square meters, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a [[quantity surveyor]]. This approach is unusual in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications. In many countries on the European continent, content that might be described as "specifications" in the United States are covered under the building code or municipal code.   Civil and infrastructure work in the United States often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be performed as well. 

Although specifications are usually issued by the [[architect]]'s office, specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various [[architectural engineering|engineer]]s or by specialist specification writers. Specification writing is often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as "Certified Construction Specifier" (CCS)  available through the Construction Specifications Institute and the  Registered Specification Writer (RSW)&lt;ref&gt;CSC-dcc.ca/Certification&lt;/ref&gt;  through Construction Specifications Canada. Specification writers are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction management companies. Specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers of [[building materials]] who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals.

In February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential) architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope &amp; Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage). Many architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use. Shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also available through Arcom, and follow the 50 division format, which was adopted in both the United States and Canada starting in 2004. The 16 division format is no longer considered standard, and is not supported by either CSI or CSC, or any of the subscription master specification services, data repositories, product lead systems, and the bulk of governmental agencies.

===Construction specifications in Egypt===
Specifications in [[Egypt]] form part of contract documents. The Housing and Building National Research Center ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150520220731/http://www.hbrc.edu.eg/en/Home.html HBRC]) is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes. The HBRC has published more than 15 books which cover building activities like earthworks, plastering, etc.

===Construction specifications in the UK===
Specifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction professionals such as [[architects]], [[architectural technologists]], [[structural engineer]]s, [[landscape architect]]s and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]. They are created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master specifications such as the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS). The National Building Specification is owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date.

UK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components.

Specifications are an integral part of [[Building Information Modeling]] and cover the non-geometric requirements.

==Food and drug specifications==
Pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various [[Pharmacopoeia]]. Current existing pharmaceutical standards include:
* [[British Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[The International Pharmacopoeia]]
* [[United States Pharmacopeia]]

If any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above [[Technical standard|standards]], it can be evaluated by the additional source of [[Pharmacopoeia]] from other nations, from industrial specifications, or from a standardized [[formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] such as

* [[British National Formulary for Children]]
* [[British National Formulary]]
* [[National Formulary]]

A similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which [[Codex Alimentarius]] ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national standards.&lt;ref name=anzfsc&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]

The coverage of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[Food labeling regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications.  These exist not only for the [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical]] product but also for the processing [[machinery]], [[Quality (business)|quality]] processes, [[packaging]], [[logistics]] ([[cold chain]]), etc. and are exemplified by ''ISO 14134'' and ''ISO 15609''&lt;ref name=oois&gt;{{cite web

The converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification.  The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point.&lt;ref name=CDER2006&gt;{{Cite book

At the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.

Data systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.

Development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations.

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|United States Food and Drug Administration]] has published specifications for a "Structured Product Label" which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.&lt;ref name=fdaspl&gt;{{cite web

Recently, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has made some progress in the area of food and drug [[Technical standard|standards]] and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of ''ISO 11238''&lt;ref name=iso11238&gt;{{cite web

==Information technology==

===Specification need===
In many contexts, particularly software, specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.

For instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also known as "UTF8-MAC"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors handling composed characters, and the [[samba (software)|samba]] file- and printer-sharing software (which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names), has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=2727174&amp;group_id=8642&amp;atid=108642 Sourceforge.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-99344.html Forums.macosxhints.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.

Such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison.

However errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed, due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems, network protocols, and thousands of software packages.

===Formal specification===
{{Main|Formal specification}}
A '''formal specification''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] description of [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] that may be used to develop an [[implementation]]. It describes ''what'' the system should do, not (necessarily) ''how'' the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use [[formal verification]] techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct [[Program refinement|refinement]] steps to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual implementation, that is correct by construction.

===Architectural specification===
In (hardware, software, or enterprise) systems development, an '''architectural specification''' is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the [[structure]], [[behavior]], and more [[view model|views]] of that [[system]].

===Program specification===
A '''program specification''' is the definition of what a [[computer program]] is expected to do. It can be ''informal'', in which case it can be considered as a user manual from a developer point of view, or ''[[Formal specification|formal]]'', in which case it has a definite meaning defined in [[mathematics|mathematical]] or programmatic terms. In practice, many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although [[safety-critical]] [[software systems]] are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

===Functional specification===
{{Main|Functional specification}}
In [[software development]], a '''functional specification''' (also, '''functional spec''' or '''specs''' or '''functional specifications document (FSD)''') is the set of [[documentation]] that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger [[software system]]. The documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to the [[software]] system and how the [[system]] responds to those inputs.

===Web service specification===

{{styles}}

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

{{For|the event sometimes called the Technological Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Axe]] made of iron, dating from Swedish [[Iron Age]], found at [[Gotland Island|Gotland]], [[Sweden]]: the iron—as a new material—initiated a dramatic revolution in technology, economy, society, warfare and politics.]]
A '''technological revolution''' is a period in which one or more [[technology|technologies]] is replaced by another technology in a short amount of time. It is an era of accelerated [[technological progress]] characterized by new [[innovation]]s whose rapid [[wikt:application|application]] and [[diffusion]] cause an abrupt change in society.

A technological revolution is made of interconnected [[technological change|technological changes]]. 

==Description by Joseph C. Galisim==
[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The [[Spinning Jenny]] and [[Spinning Mule]] (shown) greatly increased the productivity of thread manufacturing compared to the [[spinning wheel]]]]
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|240px|A [[Watt steam engine]]—the [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by [[coal]], propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F077948-0006, Jugend-Computerschule mit IBM-PC.jpg|thumb|[[IBM Personal Computer XT]] in 1988—the PC was an invention that dramatically changed not only professional life, but personal life as well.]]
A technological revolution increases [[productivity]] and [[efficiency]]. It may involve material or ideological changes caused by the introduction of a device or system. Some examples of its potential impact are business management, education, social interactions, finance and research methodology; it is not limited strictly to technical  aspects. Technological revolution rewrites the material conditions of human  existence and can reshape culture. It can play a role of a trigger of a chain of various and unpredictable changes:&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Maury(2008): ''The Technological Revolution, in The Newsletter of Foreign Policy Research Institute, Vol.13, No. 18.'' [http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1318.200807.klein.techrevolution.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What distinguishes a technological revolution  from a random collection of technology systems and justifies conceptualizing it as a revolution are two basic features:

1. The strong interconnectedness and interdependence of the participating systems in their technologies and markets.

2. The capacity to transform profoundly the rest of the economy (and eventually society).&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequences of a technological revolution are not necessarily positive. For example, innovations, such as the use of [[coal]] as an [[Energy development|energy source]], can have negative environmental impact and cause [[technological unemployment]]. The concept of technological revolution is based on the idea that [[technological progress]] is not [[linear]] but [[undulatory]]. Technological revolution can be:

* Sectoral (more technological changes in one sector, e.g. [[Green Revolution]] and [[Commercial Revolution]])
* Universal (interconnected radical changes in more sectors, the universal technological revolution can be seen as a complex of several parallel sectoral technological revolutions, e.g. [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]])

The concept of universal technological revolutions is a key factor in the Neo-Schumpeterian theory of long economic waves/cycles&lt;ref&gt;for example: Perez, Carlota (2009):''Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms.'',  in Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20, (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn) [http://carlotaperez.org/papers/and/scissors/PerezTRsTEPsTUTWP20.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Carlota Perez]], [[Tessaleno Devezas]], [[Daniel Šmihula]] and others).

==History==
The most known example of technological revolution was the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, the [[Information revolution|scientific-technical revolution]] about 1950–1960, the [[Neolithic revolution]], the [[Digital revolution]] and so on. The notion of "technological revolution" is frequently overused, therefore it is not easy to define which technological revolutions having occurred during [[world history]] were really crucial and influenced not only one segment of human activity, but had a universal impact. One universal technological revolution should be composed from several sectoral technological revolutions (in science, industry, transport and the like).

We can identify several universal technological revolutions which occurred during the [[modern era]] in [[Western culture]]:&lt;ref&gt;based on: Šmihula, Daniel (2011): ''Long waves of technological innovations, Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69. [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1. Financial-agricultural revolution (1600–1740)
* 2. Industrial revolution (1780–1840)
* 3. Technical revolution or [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1870–1920)
* 4. Scientific-technical revolution (1940–1970) 
* 5. Information and telecommunications revolution (1975–present)

Attempts to find comparable periods of well defined technological revolutions in the [[pre-modern era]] are highly speculative.&lt;ref&gt;for example: Drucker, Peter F. (1965):''The First Technological Revolution and Its Lessons.'' [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~DRBR/d_rucker5.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably one of the most systematic attempts to suggest a timeline of technological revolutions in pre-modern [[Europe]] was done by Daniel Šmihula:&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2011): [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=1694cf40-a011-408f-81f1-ccbf49d05813&amp;articleId=bf83511f-24cb-4906-acc4-824e6374ec20 ''Long waves of technological innovations''], Studia politica Slovaca, 2/2011, Bratislava, {{ISSN|1337-8163}}, pp. 50-69&lt;/ref&gt;   
* A. Indo-European  technological revolution (1900–1100 BC) 
* B. Celtic and Greek technological revolution (700–200 BC)
* C. Germano-Slavic technological revolution (300–700 AD)
* D. Medieval technological revolution (930–1200 AD)
* E. Renaissance technological revolution (1340–1470 AD)

==Potential future technological revolutions==
After 2000 there became popular the idea that a sequence of technological revolutions is not over and in the forthcoming future we will witness the dawn of a new universal technological revolution. The main innovations should develop in the fields of [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]], [[alternative energy|alternative fuel and energy systems]], [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]], [[genetic engineering]], new materials technologies and so on .&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Anton,  Richard Silberglitt, James Schneider (2001): [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1307.pdf ''The Global Technology Revolution - Bio/Nano/Materials Trends and Their Synergies with Information Technology by 2015.''], RAND, {{ISBN|0-8330-2949-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to "technological revolution" and "technical revolution"==
Sometimes the notion of "technological revolution" is used for the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the period about 1900, but in this case the designation "technical revolution" would be more proper. When the notion of [[technical revolution]] is used in more general meaning it is almost identical with technological revolution, but technological revolution requires material changes in used tools, machines, energy sources, production processes. Technical revolution can be restricted to changes in  management, organisation and so called non-material [[technologies]] (e.g. a progress in [[mathematics]] or [[accounting]]).

==List of intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions (sectoral or universal)==
[[File:PPF expansion.svg|thumb|right|Technological revolution can cause the [[production-possibility frontier]] to shift outward and initiate economic growth]]
* The [[Upper Paleolithic Revolution]]: the emergence of "high culture", new technologies and regionally distinct cultures (50,000–40,000 years ago).
* The [[Neolithic Revolution]] (perhaps 13,000 years ago), which formed the basis for human civilization to develop.
* The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance technological revolution]]: the set of inventions during the Renaissance period, roughly the 14th through the 16th century.
* The [[Commercial Revolution]]: a period of European economic expansion, [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] which lasted  from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century.
* The [[Price revolution|Price Revolution]]: a series of economic events from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, the price revolution refers most specifically to the high rate of inflation that characterized the period across [[Western Europe]].
* The [[Scientific Revolution]]: a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas around the 16th century.
* The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] (18th century), which spurred urbanisation and consequently helped launch the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* The [[Industrial Revolution]]: the major shift of technological, socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the late 18th century and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world.
* The [[Market Revolution]]: a drastic change in the manual labor system originating in the South of the [[United States]] (and soon moving to the North) and later spreading to the entire world (about 1800–1900).
* The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (1871–1914).
* The [[Green Revolution]] (1945–1975): the use of industrial fertilizers and new crops greatly increased the world's agricultural output.
* The [[Digital Revolution]]: the sweeping changes brought about by [[computing]] and [[communication technology]], starting from circa 1950 with the creation of the first general-purpose [[electronic computer]]s.
* The [[Information revolution|Information Revolution]]: the massive economic, social and technological changes resulting from the Digital Revolution (after 1960?).

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10847">'''Technopolis GS''' is a project to create a modern electronics industrial park in the [[Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaliningrad region]] of [[Russia]].

==Project background==

In 2007, in [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gusev]], for the first time in Russia, was established a production of set-top boxes for receiving satellite and terrestrial television broadcasts. Several months later, the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]] started building a plant in Gusev to manufacture household electronics products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis.gs/concept/|title=Технополис GS. Цель и задачи проекта...|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the mayor of Gusev, [[Nikolay Tsukanov]], and the president of the [[General Satellite| General Satellite Corporation]], Andrey Tkachenko, was signed in 2008, in order to create a modern [[Science park|industrial park]] in the city. The idea was approved by local authorities and was presented at the International Investment Forum "[[Sochi]]-2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|title="Технополис GS" представлен на международном инвестиционном форуме "Сочи-2008″|accessdate=2010-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150944/http://www.tehnopolis-gusev.ru/news/45/|archivedate=2012-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to locate the new production facilities in Gusev, according to Andrey Tkachenko, was made for two reasons. 
First, the experience of the first similar plant that had been working in Gusev as part of the [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zone]] - the official residence of the Corporation - was successful. Second, the administration of the city took a great interest in cooperation for the creation of Technopolis and in a comprehensive solution to the problem of the territory development.&lt;ref name="spbref"&gt;{{cite web|author=Алексей Писарев.|date=5 June 2008|url=http://www.spbit.ru/news/n49693|publisher=SPBIT|title=Технополис от "Дженерал Сателайт"|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two plants, JSC NPO Digital Television Systems (DTS) and Prankor, Ltd., were run - their products have no analogues in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 August 2009|url=http://www.spbit.su/news/n64146/|publisher=ITSZ.ru|title="Корпорация Дженерал Сателайт" строит российский Тайвань|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants produce set-top boxes for receiving the satellite and terrestrial TV broadcasts, and the production conveyor ensures a complete production cycle: starting with the motherboard and all the way up to the case and the satellite antennas as well.  Formerly, most of these devices in the Russian market were imported, usually from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 March 2009|url=http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009/04/14/344244|publisher=CNews|title=Это возможно: выпуск электроники в РФ дешевле, чем в Китае|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824043856/http://pdf.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml?2009%2F04%2F14%2F344244|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Project==
The market observers, in general, welcomed the General Satellite initiative and the investment prospects. "Industrial parks development, on one hand, is very expensive, and on the other – it is extremely knowledge-intensive”, - Pavel Zhavoronkov, an analyst at the investment firm Sovlink, said, while making a comment on the General Satellite Corporation plans. - “Based on the payroll size, 1500 to 2400 million rubles will be spent till the year 2011. The average payroll should be 1.95 billion, which will "swallow" almost 40% of the capital raised. The establishment of such an Industrial Park is possible only if stringent standards and practices are observed in the construction and cash flow. From the perspective of the country, it is an invaluable contribution to the development and science."&lt;ref name="spbref" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While implementing such projects, developers are often faced with many difficulties, of which the most serious are legislation "gaps" and official circumlocution6. In this case, the local officials led by [[Georgi Boos]] – the Kaliningrad region Governor – proved to be a considerable support for the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Василий Одарущенко.|date=6 September 2010|url=http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|title=Штефан Штайн: "Покидаю Гусев в приподнятом настроении"|publisher=ZDT-gusev|accessdate=2010-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226191706/http://www.zdt-gusev.ru/e/758196-shtefan-shtayn-pokidayu-gusev-v-pripodnyatom-n|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg| thumb | alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[prescription drugs]] is a feature of '''telepharmacy'''.]]
'''Telepharmacy''' is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of [[telemedicine]], as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff | title = Telepharmacy Increases the Safety of Chemotherapy Preparation | journal = [[US Pharmacist]] | date = 19 November 2007 | volume = 32 | number = 11 | page = 73 | url = http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/10195/?t=men's_health,chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist.

The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of [[telemedicine]]: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friesner | first = Daniel L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = David M. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Charles D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = Howard C. | title = Do remote community telepharmacies have higher medication error rates than traditional community pharmacies?

A Promising Alternative for Rural Communities | journal = [[Pharmacy Times]] | date = 1 February 2007 | url = http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2007/2007-02/2007-02-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Riley | first = Shawn | title = Tele-Pharmacy Advantages and Disadvantages | publisher = [[Health Technica]] | date = 12 July 2010 | url = http://www.healthtechnica.com/blogsphere/2010/07/12/tele-pharmacy-advantages-and-disadvantages/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation.

===Australia===
A form of telepharmacy has been in use by [[Australia]]'s [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a [[telehealth]] consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, [[Queensland]] recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesic]]s and [[gastrointestinal medication]]s. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rural Remote Health |year=2008 |issue=Apr-Jun |volume=8 |page=937 |title=Tele-pharmacy in remote medical practice: the Royal Flying Doctor Service Medical Chest Program |last1=Margolis |first1=S. A. |last2=Ypinazar |first2=V. A. |pmid=18489239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_commentary.pdf |title=Telepharmacy — opportunity or threat? |first=James |last=Davies |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/KimberPetersonTelepharmacy.pdf |title=Telepharmacy—Enabling Technology to Provide Quality Pharmacy Services in Rural and Remote Communities |first1=
Michael B |last1=Kimber |first2=Gregory M |last2=Peterson |journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research |volume=36 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including [[Medicare Part D|changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Radford | first = Andrea | last2 = Slifkin | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Fraser | first3 = Roslyn | last4 = Mason | first4 = Michelle | last5 = Mueller | first5 = Keith | title = The Experience of Sole Community Rural Independent Pharmacies with Medicare Part D: Reports from the Field | journal = Policy Paper P2006-3 | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/rural/pubs/report/WP87.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007&amp;ndash;8]], led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boyle | first = Kaitlin | last2 = Ullrich | first2 = Fred | last3 = Mueller | first3 = Keith | title = Independently owned pharmacy closures in rural America, 2003&amp;ndash;2010 | journal = Rural Policy Brief | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/rupri/publications/policybriefs/2011/Independent%20Pharmacies.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full-time pharmacist, several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[northwestern United States|northwestern]] states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy.

In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/telepharmacy/ | publisher = North Dakota State University | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site [[pharmacy technician]]s and patients through [[videoconferencing]]. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Charles D. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Howard C., Jr | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: Restoring and retaining pharmacy services in rural communities | journal = Journal of Pharmacy Technology | year = 2004 | volume = 20 | pages = 28–39 | url = http://www.jpharmtechnol.com/abstracts/volume20/January-February/28.html | doi=10.1177/875512250402000107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khan | first = Shamima | last2 = Snyder | first2 = Herbert W. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Scott | first4 = David M. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Charles D. | title = Is there a successful business case for telepharmacy? | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | publisher = [[American Telemedicine Association]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | number = 3 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2007.0045 | pmid=18570546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolpack | first = Dave | title = Telepharmacy project expands across country | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 12 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-12-virtual-pharmacy_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of [[community health centers]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by [[videoconferencing]]. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clifton | first = G.

The [[Alaska Native Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], providing telehealth services to [[Alaska Native]] populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/Awards/AwardforExcellenceinMedicationUseSafety/2006AwardsRecipients.aspx | title = 2006 Awards Recipients | publisher = ASHP Foundation | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at [[Naval Hospital Pensacola]] in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Traynor | first = Kate | title = Navy takes Telepharmacy Worldwide | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1134–1136 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/14/1134.full | doi = 10.2146/news100051 | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telehealth Advancement Act | publisher = Center for Connected Health Policy, California | url = http://cchpca.org/telehealth-advancement-act | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]]'s first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Vanessa | title = Telepharmacy could save rural Iowa sites | newspaper = [[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] | location = Cedar Rapids, Iowa | date = 18 October 2012 | url = http://thegazette.com/2012/10/18/pharmacy-draft/ | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of the various American states' [[rural health]] offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Casey1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Sorensen | first2 = Todd D. | last3 = Elias | first3 = Walter | last4 = Knudson | first4 = Alana | last5 = Gregg | first5 = Walter | title = Current practices and state regulations regarding telepharmacy in rural hospitals | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1085-1092 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/13/1085.abstract | doi = 10.2146/ajhp090531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved ([[internet access]], [[Data compression|audio/video compression]] algorithms, [[microphones]] and [[video cameras]]), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Stephania H. | title = What's holding up the telemedicine explosion? | journal = Connected Planet | date = 1 June 1998 | url = http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_whats_holding_telemedicine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings.&lt;ref name="Casey1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Elias | first2 = Walter | last3 = Knudson | first3 = Alana | last4 = Gregg | first4 = Walter | title = Implementation of Telepharmacy in Rural Hospitals: Potential for Improving Medication Safety | journal = Final Report #8 | publisher = Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center | year = 2008 | url = https://www.nodakpharmacy.com/pdfs/UMRHfirstDose.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to [[Protected health information|protect patient medical information]] in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Rathke | first = Ann | title = North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: An Update | booktitle = North Dakota Pharmacist Association Convention | date = 23–25 April 2010 | location = Minot, North Dakota | publisher = NDTP | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/NDTP_PPt__Update.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Adoption of telepharmacy in [[Canada]] began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation.&lt;ref name=CADTH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadth.ca/products/environmental-scanning/health-technology-update/issue2/telepharmacy |title=Virtual pharmacists provide long-distance care |journal=Health Technology Update |issue=2 |date=January 2006 |publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote dispensing]] machines for medication began operation in [[Ontario]], Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes.&lt;ref name="BJCP"/&gt; As of 2009, a hospital in [[Ontario]], Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ross Memorial Hospital, Lindsay, Ontario | journal = Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy | date = September–October 2009 | volume = 62 | number = 5 | page = 424 | pmc=2830020 | pmid=22478928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the [[United Kingdom]] beginning in 2010.&lt;ref name="BJCP"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_news_feature.pdf| title=Remote dispensing machines to be tested in UK hospitals |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in [[Bahrain]], [[Belgium]], [[Cuba]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/blog-post/bizstream/2013-04-24/maxor-expands-puerto-rico-operations |title=Maxor expands Puerto Rico operations |author=Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corp. |date=April 25, 2013 |type=press release |work=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Mannings]] drugstores became the first in [[Hong Kong]] to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tele-Pharmacy on Show at Mannings Stores in Hong Kong | journal = Thistle: The Magazine of [[Jardine Matheson]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | page = 8 | url = http://www.jardines.com/assets/files/NewsAndEvents/thistle/10_vol3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''theory of operation''' is a description of how a [[tool|device]] or [[system]] should work.  It is often included in [[documentation]], especially [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance/service]] documentation, or a [[user manual]].  It aids [[troubleshooting]] by providing the troubleshooter with a [[mental model]] of how the system is supposed to work.  The troubleshooter can then more easily identify discrepancies, to aid [[diagnosis]] of problem.

'''Water Data Transfer Format''' ('''WDTF''') is a data delivery standard implemented by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM) that was jointly developed with the [[CSIRO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://csiropedia.csiro.au/a-clearer-picture-of-australias-water-resources/ Media Release:A clearer picture of Australia’s water resources], March 29, 2010, CSIROpedia&lt;/ref&gt; The standard, released in 2009, specifies both the format of and the techniques used to deliver Australian water data measurements to the BoM.&lt;ref name="bom1"&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/water/standards/wdtf/ WDTF], Water Information: Regulations, Australian Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/ref&gt; Some private organisations and government agencies in Australia that collect water data are mandated to deliver it to the BoM according to the (Australian) Water Act 2007.&lt;ref name="bom2"&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/water/about/publications/document/InfoSheet_2.pdf The Water Act 2007 and Water Regulations 2008], information sheet, Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/ref&gt;

An external meteorological data source that delivers data in WDTF-compliant forms is the CSIRO Land &amp; Water's Automatic Weatherstation Network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010421072927/http://www.clw.csiro.au:80/services/weather/ CSIRO Land &amp; Water's Automatic Weatherstation Network] &lt;/ref&gt; Data from this weatherstation network can be viewed in a web browser, downloaded at text values in CSV format, downloaded in a condensed XML format for machine-to-machine communications, or downloaded as WDTF-compliant data.
 
The use of WDTF is an example of work in the field of [[Irrigation Informatics]].

The '''Woodward effect''', also referred to as a '''Mach effect''', is part of a hypothesis proposed by [[James F. Woodward]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis states that [[transient (oscillation)|transient]] [[mass]] fluctuations arise in any object that absorbs [[mass–energy equivalence|internal energy]] while undergoing a [[proper acceleration]]. Harnessing this effect could generate a [[reactionless drive|reactionless thrust]], which Woodward and others claim to measure in various experiments.&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub1"&gt;

Hypothetically, the Woodward effect would allow for [[field propulsion]] [[spacecraft propulsion|spacecraft engines]] that would not have to expel matter. Such a proposed engine, is sometimes called a Mach effect [[spacecraft propulsion|thruster]] (MET) or a Mach Effect Gravitational Assist (MEGA) drive.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect is controversial within mainstream physics because the underlying mathematics appears faulty,&lt;ref name="whealton" /&gt; and the effect, if found to be real, would violate momentum conservation and energy conservation.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014" /&gt;

==Mach effects==
According to Woodward, at least three Mach effects are theoretically possible: vectored impulse thrust, open curvature of spacetime, and closed curvature of spacetime.&lt;ref name="MSAS"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first effect, the Woodward effect, is the minimal energy effect of the hypothesis. The Woodward effect is focused primarily on proving the hypothesis and providing the basis of a Mach effect impulse thruster. In the first of three general Mach effects for propulsion or transport, the Woodward effect is an impulse effect usable for in-orbit satellite station-keeping, spacecraft reaction control systems, or at best, thrust within the solar system. The second and third effects are open and closed space-time effects. Open curved space-time effects can be applied in a field generation system to produce warp fields. Closed-curve space-time effects would be part of a field generation system to generate wormholes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The third Mach effect is a closed-curve [[spacetime]] effect or [[closed timelike curve]] called a benign wormhole. Closed-curve space is generally known as a [[wormhole]] or [[black hole]]. Prompted by [[Carl Sagan]] for the scientific basis of wormhole transport in the movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', [[Kip Thorne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kip S. Thorne |title=Kip Thorne personal web page |publisher=California Institute of Technology |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the theory of benign wormholes. The generation, stability, and traffic control of transport through a benign wormhole is only theoretical at present. One difficulty is the requirement for energy levels approximating a "Jupiter size mass".

[[Kenneth Nordtvedt]] showed in 1988 that [[gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitomagnetism]], which is an effect predicted by [[general relativity]] but hadn't yet been observed at that time and was even challenged by the scientific community, is inevitably a real effect because it is a direct consequence of the gravitational vector potential. He subsequently showed that the gravitomagnetism interaction (not to be confused with the [[Nordtvedt effect]]), like inertial [[frame dragging]] and the [[Lense–Thirring precession]], is typically a Mach effect.&lt;ref name="Nordtvedt"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture comes from a [[thought experiment]]:&lt;ref name="BoingBoing" /&gt;
{{quote
 |Ernst Mach (1838–1916) was an Austrian physicist […] contemporary of Einstein, to whom he suggested a thought experiment: What if there was only one object in the universe? Mach argued that it could not have a velocity, because according to the theory of relativity, you need at least two objects before you can measure their velocity relative to each other.

Taking this thought experiment a step further, if an object was alone in the universe, and it had no velocity, it could not have a measurable mass, because mass varies with velocity.

Mach concluded that inertial mass only exists because the universe contains multiple objects. When a gyroscope is spinning, it resists being pushed around because it is interacting with the Earth, the stars, and distant galaxies. If those objects didn't exist, the gyroscope would have no inertia.

Einstein was intrigued by this concept, and named it "Mach's principle."}}

===Gravitational origin of inertia===

A formulation of Mach's principle was first proposed as a vector theory of gravity, modeled on [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's formalism]] for [[classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]], by [[Dennis William Sciama|Dennis Sciama]] in 1953,&lt;ref name="Sciama 1953"&gt;

In this paper, Sciama stated that instantaneous inertial forces in all accelerating objects are produced by a primordial gravity-based inertial [[radiation|radiative]] [[field (physics)|field]] created by distant cosmic matter and propagating both forward ''and'' backward in time at light speed:

 |text=A first image to understand would be filming a sequence where a rock is thrown in the middle of a pond, making concentric ripples on the water propagating towards the shore.

Running the sequence backwards (thinking it as seeing events running backward in time) we then observe concentric waves propagating from the shore towards the center of the pond, where a rock emerges.

The thing to understand is that advanced waves coming back from the future never propagate farther into the past than the rock hitting the water that initiated all of the waves.

===Transient mass fluctuation===
The following has been detailed by Woodward in various peer-reviewed papers throughout the last twenty years.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"&gt;

 |title=Flux Capacitors and the Origin of Inertia
 |journal=Foundations of Physics
 |volume=34
 |issue=10
 |date=October 2004
 |pages=1475–1514
 |doi=10.1023/B:FOOP.0000044102.03268.46
 |url=http://www.enthea.org/docs/Woodward-Flux-Capacitors-Origin-Of-Inertia.pdf
 |bibcode= 2004FoPh...34.1475W
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Woodward, a transient mass fluctuation arises in an object when it absorbs "internal" energy as it is accelerated. Several devices could be built to [[accumulator (energy)|store internal energy]] during accelerations. A measurable effect needs to be driven at a high [[frequency]], so [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] [[mechanical system]]s are out of question since the rate at which their internal energy could be modified is too limited. The only systems that could run at a high frequency are [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy storage devices. For fast transient effects, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] are ruled out. A magnetic energy storage device like an [[inductor]] using a high-[[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] [[magnetic core|core material]] to transfer the [[magnetic energy]] could be specially built. But [[capacitor]]s are preferable to inductors because compact devices storing energy at a very high [[energy density]] without [[electrical breakdown]] are readily available. Shielding [[electromagnetic interference|electrical interferences]] are easier than [[magnetic shielding#Magnetic shielding|shielding magnetic]] ones. [[Ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] materials can be used to make high-frequency [[linear actuator#Electro-mechanical actuators|electro-mechanical actuators]], and they are themselves capacitors so they can be used for both energy storage and acceleration. Finally, capacitors are cheap and available in various configurations. So Mach effect experiments have always relied on capacitors so far.

When the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor is submitted to a varying [[electric power]] (charge or discharge), Woodward's hypothesis predicts&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt; a transient mass fluctuation arises according to the transient mass equation (TME):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta m_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi G}\left[\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant mass|proper mass]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
*&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the proper [[density]] of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the dielectric,
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous power delivered to the system.

This equation is not the full Woodward equation as seen in the book. There is a third term, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \frac{\phi}{c^2} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;which Woodward discounts because his [[gauge theory|gauge]] sets&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\phi}{c^2} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;; the derivatives of this quantity must therefore be negligible.&lt;ref name="Woodward2004b"/&gt;

===Propellantless propulsion===
The previous equation shows that when the [[dielectric]] material of a [[capacitor]] is cyclically charged then discharged while being accelerated, its [[density|mass density]] fluctuates, by around plus or minus its [[invariant mass|rest mass]] value. Therefore, a device can be made to [[oscillate]] either in a linear or orbital path, such that its mass density is higher while the mass is moving forward, and lower while moving backward, thus creating an [[acceleration]] of the device in the forward direction, i.e. a thrust. This effect, used repeatedly, does not expel any [[particle]] and thus would represent a type of apparent [[reactionless drive|propellantless propulsion]], which seems to be in contradiction with [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]]. However, Woodward states there is no violation of momentum conservation in Mach effects:&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;
{{quote
 |If we produce a fluctuating mass in an object, we can, at least in principle, use it to produce a stationary force on the object, thereby producing a propulsive force thereon without having to expel propellant from the object. We simply push on the object when it is more massive, and pull back when it is less massive. The reaction forces during the two parts of the cycle will not be the same due to the mass fluctuation, so a time-averaged net force will be produced. ''This may seem to be a violation of momentum conservation. But the [[Lorentz invariance]] of the theory guarantees that no conservation law is broken. Local momentum conservation is preserved by the [[flux]] of [[momentum]] in the gravity field that is chiefly exchanged with the distant matter in the universe.'' [emphasis added]
}}

Two terms are important for propulsion on the right-hand side of the previous equation:
*The first, [[linear equation|linear term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[impulse (physics)|impulse]] engine'' term because it expresses mass fluctuation depending on the derivative of the power, and scales linearly with the frequency. Past and current experiments about Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]s are designed to demonstrate thrust and the control of one type of Mach effect.
*The second, [[quadratic equation|quadratic term]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\left(\frac{1}{\rho_0 c^2}\right)^2 \frac{P^2}{V}&lt;/math&gt; is what Woodward calls the ''[[wormhole]]'' term, because ''it is always negative''. Although this term appears to be many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] weaker than the first term, which makes it usually negligible, theoretically, the second term's effect could become huge in some circumstances. The second term, the wormhole term, is indeed driven by the first impulse engine term, which fluctuates mass by around plus or minus the rest mass value. When fluctuations reach a very high amplitude and mass density is driven very close to zero, the equation shows that mass should achieve very large negative values very quickly, with a strong non-linear behavior. In this regard, the Woodward effect could generate [[exotic matter]], although this still remains very speculative due to the lack of any available experiment that would highlight such an effect.

Applications of propellantless propulsion include straight-line [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] or impulse engine, open curved fields for starship [[warp drive]]s, and even the possibility of closed curved fields such as traversable benign [[wormhole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Negative bare mass of the electron===

The mass of the electron is positive according to the [[mass–energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but this [[invariant mass]] is made from the [[bare mass]] of the electron "clothed" by a [[Virtual particle|virtual photon]] cloud. According to [[quantum field theory]], as those virtual particles have an energy more than twice the bare mass of the electron, mandatory for [[pair production]] in [[renormalization]], the nonelectromagnetic bare mass of the "unclothed" electron has to be ''negative''.&lt;ref name="Milonni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milonni|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter W. Milonni|title=The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics|date=1994|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston|isbn=0124980805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPHJCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|LCCN=93029780|oclc=422797902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the [[ADM formalism]], Woodward proposes that the physical interpretation of the "wormhole term" in his transient mass equation could be a way to expose the negative bare mass of the electron, in order to produce large quantities of exotic matter that could be used in a warp drive to propel a spacecraft or generate traversable wormholes.&lt;ref name="Woodward2011" /&gt;

==Space travel==
Current [[spacecraft]] achieve a change in velocity by the expulsion of [[propellant]], the extraction of momentum from stellar [[radiation pressure]] or the [[stellar wind]] or the utilisation of a [[gravity assist]] ("slingshot") from a planet or moon. These methods are limiting in that [[rocket propellant]]s have to be accelerated as well and are eventually depleted, and the stellar wind or the gravitational fields of planets can only be utilized locally in the [[Solar System]]. In [[interstellar space]] and bereft of the above resources, different forms of propulsion are needed to propel a spacecraft, and they are referred to as advanced or [[interstellar travel#Faster-than-light travel: warped spacetime and wormholes|exotic]].&lt;ref&gt;

Even ignoring for the moment the impact on [[interstellar travel]], future spacecraft driven by impulse engines based on Mach effects would represent an astounding breakthrough in terms of [[interplanetary spaceflight]] alone, enabling the rapid [[space colonization|colonization]] of the entire solar system. Travel times being limited only by the specific power of the available power supplies and the acceleration human physiology can endure, they would allow crews to reach any moon or planet in our solar system in less than three weeks. For example, a typical one-way trip at an acceleration of [[g-force|1 g]] from the Earth to the [[Moon]] would last only about 4 hours; to [[Mars]], 2 to 5 days; to the [[asteroid belt]], 5 to 6 days; and to [[Jupiter]], 6 to 7 days.&lt;ref name="March2007"&gt;

===Warp drives and wormholes===
As shown by the transient mass fluctuation equation above, exotic matter could be theoretically created. A large quantity of negative [[energy density]] would be the key element needed to create warp drives&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As such, if proven to be scientifically valid, practically feasible and scaling as predicted by the hypothesis, the Woodward effect could not only be used for interplanetary travel, but also for apparent [[faster-than-light]] interstellar travel:
*The [[negative mass]] could be used to warp spacetime around a spaceship according to an [[Alcubierre metric]].&lt;ref name="MUSH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcubierre"/&gt;
*Enough exotic matter could also be concentrated into a point of space to create a [[wormhole]], and prevent it from collapsing. Woodward and others also state that exotic matter could defocus energy at the outer mouth of the [[wormhole]] (making it a [[white hole]]) and shape the throat of such a [[gravitational singularity]] flat enough to avoid [[event horizon|horizon]] and [[tidal force|tidal]] stresses, resulting in an "absurdly benign traversable [[wormhole]]" linking two regions of distant spacetime, a concept widespread in science fiction as [[Jumpgate|stargate]]s, which could be used for instant interstellar and intergalactic travel or [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="MSAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MUSH"&gt;

Woodward and his associates have claimed since the 1990s to have successfully measured forces at levels great enough for practical use and also claim to be working on the development of a practical prototype [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]. No practical working devices have yet been publicly demonstrated.&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardPub2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2012"/&gt;

The NIAC contract awarded in 2017 by [[NASA]] for the development of Mach effect thrusters is a primary three-task effort, two experimental and one analytical:&lt;ref name="NIAC 2017 Mach Effect" /&gt;

# Improvement of the current laboratory-scale devices, in order to provide long duration thrust at levels required for practical propulsion applications.
# Design and development of a power supply and electrical systems to provide feedback and control of the input AC voltage, and resonant frequency, that determine the efficiency of the MET.
# Improve theoretical thrust predictions and build a reliable model of the device to assist in perfecting the design. Predict maximum thrust achievable by one device and how large an array of thrusters would be required to send a probe, of size 1.5 m diameter by 3 m, of total mass 1245&amp;nbsp;kg including a modest 400&amp;nbsp;kg of payload, a distance of 8 light-years away.

==Experiments==

===Test devices===

====Mach-Lorentz Thruster====
[[File:Woodward Effect Device.png|thumb|right|Photograph of the 2006 Woodward effect MLT test article.]]
A former type of Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] was the Mach-Lorentz thruster (MLT). It used a charging [[capacitor]] embedded in a magnetic field created by a magnetic coil. A Lorentz force, the cross product between the electric field and the magnetic field, appears and acts upon the ions inside the capacitor dielectric. In such electromagnetic experiments, the power can be applied at frequencies of several megahertz, unlike [[PZT]] stack actuators where frequency is limited to tens of kilohertz. The photograph shows the components of a Woodward effect test article used in a 2006 experiment.&lt;ref name="AIP1"/&gt;

However, a problem with some of these devices was discovered in 2007 by physicist Nembo Buldrini, who called it the ''Bulk Acceleration Conjecture'':
{{quote
 |What [Nembo Buldrini] pointed out was that given the way the transient terms of the Mach effect equation are written – in terms of the time-derivatives of the proper energy density – it is easy to lose sight of the requirement in the derivation that the object in which the mass fluctuations occur must be accelerating at the same time. In some of the experimental cases, no provision for such "bulk" acceleration was made.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; As an example, the capacitors affixed to the tines of the tuning fork in the Cramer and the students' experiments made no provision for such an acceleration. Had the tuning fork been separately excited and an electric field applied to the capacitor(s) been properly phased, an effect might have been seen. But to simply apply a voltage to the capacitors and then look for a response in the tuning fork should not have been expected to produce a compelling result.

Other examples could be cited and discussed. Suffice it to say, though, that after Nembo focused attention in the issue of bulk accelerations in the production of Mach effects, the design and execution of experiments changed. The transition to that work, and recent results of experiments presently in progress, are addressed in the next chapter.

&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; By "bulk" acceleration we are referring to the fact that the conditions of the derivation include that the object be both accelerated and experience internal energy changes. The acceleration of ions in the material of a capacitor, for example, does not meet this condition. The capacitor as a whole must be accelerated in bulk while it is being polarized.

====Mach Effect Thruster or MEGA drive====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:All PZT Mach effect thruster test unit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Photograph of the PZT stack of a Mach effect test device.]] --&gt;
To address this issue, Woodward started to design and build a new kind of device known as a MET (Mach Effect Thruster) and later a MEGA drive (Mach Effect Gravitational Assist drive), using capacitors and a series of thick [[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] disks. This ceramic is [[piezoelectric]], so it can be used as an electromechanical actuator to accelerate an object placed against it: its [[crystal structure|crystalline structure]] expands when a certain [[electrical polarity]] is applied, then contracts when the opposite field is applied, and the stack of discs vibrates.

In the first tests, Woodward simply used a [[capacitor]] between two stacks of PZT disks. The capacitor, while being electrically charged to change its internal energy density, is shuttled back and forth between the PZT actuators. [[Piezoelectric]] materials can also generate a measurable voltage potential across their two faces when pressed, so Woodward first used some small portions of PZT material as little [[accelerometer]]s put on the surface of the stack, to precisely tune the device with the power supply. Then Woodward realized that PZT material and the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor were very similar, so he built devices that are made exclusively of PZT disks, without any conventional capacitor, applying different signals to different portions of the cylindrical stack. The available picture taken by his graduate student Tom Mahood in 1999 shows a typical all-PZT stack with different disks:&lt;ref name=mahood&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/
 |title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton

 |accessdate=27 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The outer, thicker disks on the left and right are the "shuttlers".
*The inner stack of thin disks in the center are the shuttled capacitors storing energy during acceleration, where any mass shift would occur.
*The even thinner disks placed between the shuttlers and on both side of the inner disk capacitors are the "squeezometers' acting as accelerometers.
During forward acceleration and before the transient mass change in the capacitor decays, the resultant increased [[momentum]] is transferred forward to a bulk "reaction mass" through an [[elastic collision]] (the [[brass]] end cap on the left in the picture). Conversely, the following decrease in the mass density takes place during its backward movement.
While operating, the PZT stack is isolated in a Faraday cage and put on a sensitive [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm for thrust measurements, inside a vacuum chamber. Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to [[ballistic pendulum]]s to multiple [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2013"/&gt;

In the future, Woodward plans to scale thrust levels, switching from the current [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[dielectric]] [[ceramic]]s ([[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] stacks) to new [[high-κ dielectric]] [[nanocomposite]] [[polymer]]s, like [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN]], [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN-PT]] or [[calcium copper titanate|CCTO]]. Nevertheless, such materials are new, quite difficult to find, and are [[electrostriction|electrostrictive]], not piezoelectric.&lt;ref name="Scaling"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and a NIAC phase I grant was awarded in April 2017 to develop a better theoretical model and technical solutions for greater efficiency as a [[Technology readiness level|TRL-1 technology]]: reduction of heating and longer operating time using ''chirped pulses''; and design of a dedicated electronic circuit with better frequency impedance matching. The concept of an interstellar mission to [[Proxima Centauri b]] was also detailed. Consecutively to these achievements, a NIAC Phase II grant was awarded in March 2018 to test an improved design with a higher operational frequency to increase the output thrust.&lt;ref name="NIAC 2018 Mach Effect" /&gt;

====EmDrive====
{{main|RF resonant cavity thruster}}
Another type of claimed propellantless thruster, called the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]] by its inventor British engineer Roger Shawyer, has been proposed to work due to a Mach effect:&lt;ref name="IBT EmDrive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hacked EmDrive" /&gt;

The asymmetric resonant [[microwave cavity]] would act as a capacitor where:
* surface currents propagate inside the cavity on the conic wall between the two end plates,
* electromagnetic resonant modes create electric charges on each end plate,
* a Mach effect is triggered by [[Lorentz force]]s from surface currents on the conic wall,
* a thrust force arises in the [[Radio frequency|RF]] cavity, due to the variation of the electromagnetic density from [[Evanescent field|evanescent wave]]s inside the skin layer.
When a [[polymer]] insert is placed asymmetrically in the cavity, its dielectric properties result in greater asymmetry, while decreasing the cavity [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].
The cavity's acceleration is a function of all the above factors, and the model can explain the acceleration of the cavity with and without a dielectric.&lt;ref name="Montillet 2016" /&gt;

===Results===
From his initial paper onward Woodward has claimed that this effect is detectable with modern technology.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt; He and others have performed and continue to perform experiments to detect the small forces that are predicted to be produced by this effect. So far some groups claim to have detected forces at the levels predicted and other groups have detected forces at much greater than predicted levels or nothing at all. To date there has been no announcement conclusively confirming proof for the existence of this effect or ruling it out.&lt;ref name="io9-2013"/&gt;

*In 1990, Woodward's original paper on Mach effects included an experiment with results.&lt;ref name="Woodward-1990-497"/&gt;
*In 1999, Thomas L. Mahood, Woodward's [[graduate student]] from 1997 to 1999, reported thrusts ranging from 0.03 to 15&amp;nbsp;µN in a setup comprising a torque pendulum in a vacuum chamber, at the [[Space Technology and Applications International Forum]] (STAIF) and in his [[Master of Science|Master of Science in Physics]] [[thesis]].&lt;ref name="Mahood1999"&gt;

*In 2004, [[John G.

==Debate==

===Inertial frames===
All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion with respect to one another; they are not accelerating in the sense that an accelerometer at rest in one would detect zero acceleration. Despite their ubiquitous nature, inertial frames are still not fully understood. That they exist is certain, but what causes them to exist – and whether these sources could constitute reaction-media – are still unknown. Marc Millis, of the NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]], stated " ''For example, the notion of thrusting without propellant evokes objections of violating conservation of momentum. This, in turn, suggests that space drive research must address conservation of momentum. From there it is found that many relevant unknowns still linger regarding the source of the inertial frames against which conservation is referenced. Therefore, research should revisit the unfinished physics of inertial frames, but in the context of propulsive interactions.'' "&lt;ref name="Millis2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mach's principle]] is generally defined within [[general relativity]] as "the local inertia frame is completely determined by the dynamic fields in the universe." Rovelli evaluated a number of versions of "Mach's principle" that exist in the literature. Some are partially correct and some have been dismissed as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Rovelli, Carlo 2004"/&gt;

===Conservation of momentum===

A challenge to the mathematical foundations of Woodward's hypothesis were raised in a paper published by the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 2001. In the paper, John Whealton noted that the experimental results of Oak Ridge scientists can be explained in terms of force contributions due to time-varying [[thermal expansion]], and stated that a laboratory demonstration produced 100 times the Woodward effect without resorting to non-Newtonian explanations.&lt;ref name="whealton"&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Woodward published a criticism of Whealton's math and understanding of the physics involved, and built an experiment attempting to demonstrate the flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13020.0;attach=119594

&lt;/ref&gt;

A rate of change in [[momentum]] represents a force, whereby '''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''. Whealton et al. use the technical definition, '''F'''{{=}}d(''m'''''v''')/d''t'', which can be expanded to '''F'''{{=}}''m'' d'''v'''/d''t'' + d''m''/d''t'' '''v'''. This second term has both delta mass and '''v''', which is measured instantaneously; this term will, in general, cancel out the force from the inertial response terms predicted by Woodward. Woodward argued that the d''m''/d''t'' '''v''' term does not represent a physical force on the device, because it vanishes in a frame where the device is momentarily stationary.&lt;ref name=Woodward2004b/&gt;

In an appendix to his thesis, Mahood argues that the unexpectedly small magnitude of the results in his experiments are a confirmation of the cancellation predicted by Whealton; the results are instead due to higher-order mass transients which are not exactly cancelled.&lt;ref name="MahoodThesis"/&gt; Mahood would later describe this argument as "one of the very few things I've done in my life that I actually regret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahood|first1=Thomas|title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton|url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/|website=Other Hand|accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the momentum and energy exchange with distant matter guarantees global conservation of energy and momentum, this [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is supplied at no material cost, unlike the case with conventional fuels. For this reason, when the [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is ignored, a propellantless thruster behaves locally like a free energy device. This is immediately apparent from basic Newtonian analysis: if constant power produces constant thrust, then input energy is linear with time and output (kinetic) energy is quadratic with time. Thus there exists a break-even time (or distance or velocity) of operation, above which more energy is output than is input. The longer it is allowed to accelerate, the more pronounced will this effect become, as simple Newtonian physics predicts.

Considering those conservation issues, a Mach effect thruster relies on Mach's principle, hence it is not an electrical to kinetic [[transducer]], i.e. it does not convert [[electric energy]] to [[kinetic energy]]. Rather, a Mach effect thruster is a gravinertial [[transistor]] that controls the flow of gravinertial [[flux]], in and out of the active mass of the thruster. The primary power into the thruster is contained in the flux of the [[gravitational field]], not the electricity that powers the device. Failing to account for this flux, is much the same as failing to account for the [[wind]] on a [[sail]].&lt;ref name="Stahl 2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mach effects are relativistic by nature, and considering a spaceship accelerating with a Mach effect thruster, the propellant is not accelerating with the ship, so the situation should be treated as an accelerating and therefore [[non-inertial reference frame]], where '''F''' does not equal ''m'''''a'''. Keith H. Wanser, professor of physics at California State University, Fullerton, published a paper in 2013 concerning the conservation issues of Mach effect thrusters.&lt;ref name="Wanser 2014"&gt;{{cite journal

==Quantum mechanics==
In 2009, [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|Harold "Sonny" White]] of [[NASA]] proposed the Quantum Vacuum Fluctuation (QVF) conjecture, a non-relativistic hypothesis based on quantum mechanics to produce momentum fluxes even in empty [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Where Sciama's gravinertial field of [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] is used in the Woodward effect, the White conjecture replaces the Sciama gravinertial field with the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]] field. The local reactive forces are generated and conveyed by momentum fluxes created in the QED vacuum field by the same process used to create momentum fluxes in the gravinertial field. White uses [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[right-hand rule|rules]] to quantify this local momentum interaction where in comparison Woodward applies [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name="Sonny2011"/&gt;

Based on the White conjecture, the proposed theoretical device is called a [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] (QVPT) or Q-thruster. No experiments have been performed to date.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Unlike a Mach effect thruster instantaneously exchanging momentum with the distant cosmic matter through the advanced/retarded waves ([[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]]) of the radiative gravinertial field, Sonny's "Q-thruster" would appear to violate momentum conservation, for the thrust would be produced by pushing off virtual "Q" particle/antiparticle pairs that would annihilate after they have been pushed on. However, it would not necessarily violate the law of conservation of energy, as it requires an electric current to function, much like any "standard" MHD thruster, and cannot produce more kinetic energy than its equivalent net energy input.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Woodward and Fearn showed why the amount of [[electron]]-[[positron]] [[pair production|virtual pairs]] of the quantum vacuum, used by White as a virtual plasma propellant, cannot account for thrusts in any isolated, closed electromagnetic system such as the QVPT or the [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]].&lt;ref name="JBIS 2016a"&gt;
