In [[1836_in_the_United_States|1836]] in a meeting in [[Saratoga, New York]] the two groups merge to form the '''American Temperance Union''', introducing the principle of total abstinence or "[[teetotalism]]".

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3075">[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], is depicted in novels, film and television.

Anne is played by [[Margaret Tyzack]] in the 1969 [[BBC]] television serial ''[[The First Churchills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_first_churchills_1971/| title=The First Churchills (1971)| publisher=rottentomatoes.com| access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] portrayed her in the 2004 BBC drama documentary ''[[Wren: The Man Who Built Britain]]''. In the 1984 comedy ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' she was played by [[Peter Bull]] (in his last film role) as a fat, senile woman, dominated by Sarah Churchill. 

Anne is a character in the novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], and was portrayed on screen by [[Anna Kallina]] in the 1921 Austrian silent adaptation ''[[The Grinning Face]]'' and by [[Josephine Crowell]] in the [[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|1928 silent adaptation]]. She is also a character in the play ''[[Le Verre d'eau]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]]; [[Gunnel Lindblom]] portrayed her in the 1960 Swedish TV adaptation ''Ett Glas vatten'', [[Liselotte Pulver]] in the 1960 West German film adaptation ''[[Das Glas Wasser]]'', [[Judit Halász]] in the 1977 Hungarian TV adaptation ''Sakk-matt'', and [[Natalya Belokhvostikova]] in the 1979 Soviet film adaptation ''[[Stakan vody]]'' (Стакан воды).

The titular play ''[[Queen Anne (play)| Queen Anne]]'', written by the playwright [[Helen Edmundson]], dramatizes the relationship between Anne and [[Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], as well as the court politics and succession issues of Anne's court. It was first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon]] between November, 2015 and January, 2016, before opening at the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] in London, where it ran between June and September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/queen-anne/ |title=Queen Anne &amp;#124; Royal Shakespeare Company &amp;#124; Theatre |publisher=Rsc.org.uk |date=2015-05-05 |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsc.org.uk/queen-anne/about-the-play&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Anne is portrayed by actress [[Olivia Colman]] in the 2018 film ''[[The Favourite (film)|The Favourite]]'', which centers on the competition for the queen's affection between the Duchess of Marlborough and [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/09/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-lesbian-love-triangle-1201999899/|title=Yorgos Lanthimos on the Lesbian Love Triangle of 'The Favourite': 'I Didn't Want This to Become an Issue'|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=3 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural encoding''' is a process in which a [[website]] or related node is "encoded" with the [[language]], symbols, or representative styles of particular [[culture]] or [[subculture]]. "Encoding" refers to the [[Digital data|digital]] processes that make the representative culture of the site self-evident.

For example, interpunk.com uses punk [[iconography]] including a [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] [[icon]], [[font]]s, and a do it yourself interface for selling music that cleary establishes the [[Punk subculture|punk]] identity of the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9074">The expression '''cultural jet lag''' (or '''cultural jetlag''') was first coined by Marc Perraud during his research into cross-cultural psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Perraud, Marc. Cultural Jet Lag in Third Culture Kids. nyc-o-time management consulting&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the expression as the ''phenomenon of partial socialization in adults born from bi-cultural/national unions and whose childhood was characterized by nomadic displacement during key personality developmental stages''. ''Jet'' symbolically designates international travel as the cause, ''cultural lag'' the resulting disconnect observed in these patients.

Originally the author used the expressions ''social jet lag'' and ''cultural jet lag'' interchangeably, however the expression ''social jet lag'' has since more widely become associated with an unrelated [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] and cultural jet lag has therefore become the conventional term. Cultural jet lag is sometimes just referred to by its initials: CJL. During some of the presentations of his research, Marc Perraud also coined the term ''cultural schizophrenia'' to explain the elements of confusion in children constantly exposed to changing cultural and moral environments. This expression is to be seen only as an attempt at vulgarization using popular imagery and does not refer to the actual accepted psychological definition, diagnosis or symptoms of clinical [[schizophrenia]]. 

Incidentally, the expression cultural jet lag was also used in the 1980s as a title for a comic strip [https://web.archive.org/web/20100228044623/http://www.jimsiergey.com/CulturalJetLag.htm], that focused on providing social commentary in the United States (featured in the ''[[Humor Times]]''). This title reflects the notions of distance between the author and the subject of his cultural satire but does not reflect the literal and total connotations of the definition cited prior. (disambiguation)

==People most commonly affected==
Cultural jet lag refers to the feeling of disconnect that [[Third Culture Kids]] (TCKs), as they have now become known, experience in relation to any culture, including the ones from which they stem. This disconnect, also present in Adult Third Culture Kids (ATCKs),&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993).ATCKs have problems relating to their own ethnic groups. International Schools Services&lt;/ref&gt; applies to all the cultures to which they are/were exposed, whether it be their parents' cultures or those to which they were exposed during their upbringing through international travel.

==Symptoms and characteristics==
Third Culture Kids, those that were brought between countries, and in a bi-cultural environment, also referred to as [[global nomad]]s, typically experience varying degrees of cultural jet lag. While they exhibit high levels of [[cross-cultural]] competence (3C)—in that they are in tune with the different cultures between which they grew up, sometimes illustrating more astute understanding than mono-cultured counterparts because of their multiple referential points—they generally have the feeling that they remain outside the culture, looking in. They do not experience the same drives, desires and constraints as other non-TCK members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tckworld.com|title=TCKWorld: The Official Home of Third Culture Kids (TCKs)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their cultures and feel like constant spectators to any visceral dynamic (patriotism, identification, national pride, duty, allegiance, sports fan, political involvement etc.)

Cultural jet lag drives a disconnect that can have varying levels of sociability impact on the TCK depending on their character and their support structures (friends and family in particular). Research done at scenyc [http://www.scenyc.com], a company that regroups one of the largest concentration of TCKs (90% of employees), has shown that:
* All TCK employees exhibit some degree of cultural jet lag, while symptoms vary in breadth and intensity from person to person
* The cultural disconnect they experience with any ''mono-cultured person'', even well-travelled, makes their natural tendency to seek out and bond with others experiencing the same condition. This holds true in friendship, in love and in work relationships.
* CJL appears to increase the prevalence of certain psychological traits/abnormalities: [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] behavior, relationship and commitment difficulties, [[apathy]] and boredom, [[substance abuse]], [[social anxiety]] and malaise, light [[depression (mood)|depression]], and a shared feeling of ''lack of identity'', of ''referent'' and of ''ownership''.
* On the flip side CJL seems to pre-dispose individuals to develop and be rewarded for their unique perspective on the world. This manifests itself through a higher than usual prevalence artistic and creative activities: advertising, design, music, creative writing—all of which it is postulated require a certain abstraction from conventional social and cultural models. CJL also seems to predispose TCKs to educational fields and/or careers that directly tap into their global awareness and perspectives: international relations, humanitarian and strategic thinking

==Other similar cross-cultural phenomena==
Cultural jet lag is sometimes confused with several apparently close but dissimilar cross-cultural phenomena:
* [[Culture shock]]. Simply put, culture shock appears as a result of a discreet decision by an individual to travel abroad. CJL differs from culture shock in that it is not associated to a precise event but rather a lifelong condition linked to the particularities of an uprooted upbringing. CJL neither appears abruptly nor subsides over time, it is a state of being that characterizes those that have experienced a culturally de-structured upbringing. Someone's realization or third party diagnosis of CJL may be sudden, in the form of an "a-ha" moment, but he or she will quickly realize that it is simply an explanation of his or her state of being from as long as he or she can remember.
* CJL also differs from the cultural disconnect that remains between the [[expatriate]] and his host country once he or she has overcome the initial culture shock. Despite the feeling of disconnect with his host country, the expatriate will never feel lost for he or she still maintains a sense of bond to his or her original culture. Even if this bond dissipates slowly with time, the expatriate will never exhibit the same psychological symptoms as those that characterize CJL. This is because the expatriate will always rely on the psychological stability he or she developed based on a stable mono-cultural referential during key youth developmental stages.
* CJL also differs from what has been called [[reverse culture shock]],&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Julie and Linda Lankenau (Undated) "Third Culture Kids: Returning to their Passport Country." US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; the reaction caused by an expatriate returning to his or her home country after years of being abroad. As with the example described above, no one can suddenly experience cultural jet lag as its symptoms stem from an atypical developmental environment and not a situational stimuli during adulthood (i.e. after character formation maturity).

==Ongoing research==
Some high level research has been done on the Third Culture Kids [http://www.tckworld.com/useem/art3.html].&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell AB, Useem RH (1993). TCKs Experience Prolonged Adolescence. International Schools Services&lt;/ref&gt; However this research has primarily described attributes, anecdotes and summarized basic behavioral/sociological observations. While the serious study of the psychological mechanisms and impacts of cultural jet lag is still in its infancy, it has been brought to the forefront because of the impact globalization has had on the number of children and future adults that will experience CJL.

Research currently underway is testing the postulate that cultural jet lag stems from an atypical crystallization of the [[super-ego]] during the child developmental phases. While typical children inherit morals and values first from their parents and then from their environments in a second stage, culturally jet lagged children, devoid of a single moral and cultural referential in their environment, later develop an overstated role of [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] in their [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] balance (referring to [[Freudian]] theory).

Statistical research is also underway to identify the psychological impacts of CJL, in particular the:
* Prevalence of clinical psychological abnormalities in culturally jet lagged adults
* Preferred psychological coping mechanisms of culturally jet lagged adolescents
* Comparing the statistical distribution of [[Myers Briggs]] profiles in CJL adults vs. the general population

'''Cultural relativism''' is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than be judged against the criteria of another.

It was established as [[axiom]]atic in [[anthropology|anthropological]] research by [[Franz Boas]] in the first few decades of the 20th century and later popularized by his students.  Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes".&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1887 "Museums of Ethnology and their classification" ''Science'' 9: 589&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boas did not coin the term. 

The first use of the term recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was by philosopher and social theorist [[Alain Locke]] in 1924 to describe [[Robert Lowie]]'s "extreme cultural relativism", found in the latter's 1917 book ''[https://archive.org/details/cultureethnology00lowiiala Culture and Ethnology]''.&lt;ref&gt;"cultural, ''adj.'' and ''n.''", ''OED Online'', Sept 2009, Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50055630, citing Locke's article "The Concept of Race as Applied to Social Culture", ''Howard Review'' 1 (1924): pp. 290-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub species, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and [[Race (classification of humans)|race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/Theory/cultural_relativism.htm |title=Cultural Relativism |last=Glazer |first=Mark |location=Texas |publisher=University of Texas-Pan American |date=December 16, 1994 |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613222929/http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/Theory/cultural_relativism.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural relativism involves specific [[epistemology|epistemological]] and methodological claims.  Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific [[ethics|ethical]] stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with [[moral relativism]].

==Epistemological origins==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 3.38) observes on the relativity of [[mores]] ([[Nomos (sociology)|νόμοι]]):
{{quote|If anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably&amp;mdash;after careful considerations of their relative merits&amp;mdash;choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best; and that being so, it is unlikely that anyone but a madman would mock at such things. There is abundant evidence that this is the universal feeling about the ancient customs of one's country.|tr. [[Aubrey de Selincourt]]}}

He mentions an anecdote of [[Darius the Great]] who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the [[funeral]] customs of the [[Greeks]] and the [[Callatiae]], peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced [[cremation]] and [[funerary cannibalism]], respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribe's practices.

The epistemological claims that led to the development of cultural relativism have their origins in the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  The [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that human beings are not capable of direct, unmediated knowledge of the world.  All of our experiences of the world are mediated through the human mind, which universally structures perceptions according to ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts of time and space.

Although Kant considered these mediating structures universal, his student [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] argued that human creativity, evidenced by the great variety in national [[culture]]s, revealed that human experience was mediated not only by universal structures, but by particular cultural structures as well.  The philosopher and linguist [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant and Herder's ideas.

Although Herder focused on the positive value of cultural variety, the [[sociologist]] [[William Graham Sumner]] called attention to the fact that one's culture can limit one's perceptions.  He called this principle [[ethnocentrism]], the viewpoint that "one's own group is the center of everything", against which all other groups are judged.

==As a methodological and heuristic device==
According to George Marcus, Michael Fischer, and Sam Bohart,

{{quote|20th century social and cultural anthropology has promised its still largely Western readership enlightenment on two fronts.  The one has been the salvaging of distinct cultural forms of life from a process of apparent global Westernization. With both its romantic appeal and its scientific intentions, anthropology has stood for the refusal to accept this conventional perception of homogenization toward a dominant Western model.&lt;ref name="Michael M.J page 1"&gt;George Marcus and Michael M.J. Fischer 1986 ''Anthropology as Cultural Critique: The Experimental Moment in the Human Sciences'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. page 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cultural relativism was in part a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful.  Franz Boas, originally trained in [[physics]] and [[geography]], and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways.  He understood "culture" to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion.  He assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as

{{quote|the totality of the mental and physical reactions and activities that characterize the behavior of the individuals composing a social group collectively and individually in relation to their natural environment, to other groups, to members of the group itself, and of each individual to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1963 [1911] ''The Mind of Primitive Man'' New York: Collier Books.  page 149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.  The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.

===As a methodological tool===
Between World War I and World War II, "cultural relativism" was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality, and salvage of non-Western cultures.  It functioned to transform Boas' epistemology into methodological lessons.

This is most obvious in the case of language.  Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of [[Linguistic relativity]]).

Thus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways.  Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word "green". When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for blue, others identify it using their word for yellow. Thus, Boas's student [[Melville Herskovits]] summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: "Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation."

Boas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article, "On Alternating Sounds"&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1889 "On Alternating Sounds", ''American Anthropologist'' 2:47-53&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of linguists at Boas' time had observed that speakers of some Native American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas however noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single [[phoneme|sound]], but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas's student, the linguist [[Edward Sapir]] later noted that also English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound, for example few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter {{angle bracket|t}} in the words "tick" and "stick" are phonetically different, the first being generally affricated and the other aspirated – a speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme.

Boas's students drew not only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as [[Karl Pearson]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]], from "a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage" as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology.

Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism.  One such method is that of [[ethnography]]: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.

In this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities.  Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, "Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole.  The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation."&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Virginia 1948 "In Reply to Elgin Williams" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(1) 163-166&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a heuristic tool===
Another method was [[ethnology]]: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner.  In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together &amp;ndash; regardless of provenance.  Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species.  Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms.

In an article in the journal ''Science'', Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of [[Charles Darwin]]'s main contributions to evolutionary theory:

{{quote|It is only since the development of the evolutional theory that it became clear that the object of study is the individual, not abstractions from the individual under observation.  We have to study each ethnological specimen individually in its history and in its medium ... By regarding a single implement outside of its surroundings, outside of other inventions of the people to whom it belongs, and outside of other phenomena affecting that people and its productions, we cannot understand its meanings ... Our objection ... is, that classification is not explanation.&lt;ref name=boas74&gt;Boas, Franz 1974 [1887] "The Principles of Ethnological Classification", in ''A Franz Boas reader'' ed. by George W. Stocking Jr. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-06243-0}}. page 62,62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, Franz 1887 "Museums of Ethnology and their Classification", in Science 9: 587-589.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded:

{{quote|It is my opinion that the main object of ethnological collections should be the dissemination of the fact that civilization is not something absolute, but that it is relative, and that our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.&lt;ref name=boas74/&gt;}}

Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred (1948) "Anthropology" p. 11. Harcourt and Brace, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now while some of the interest in (so called solial culture science) anthropology in its earlier stages was in the exotic and the out-of-the-way, yet even this antiquarian motivation ultimately contributed to a broader result.  Anthropologists became aware of the diversity of culture.  They began to see the tremendous range of its variations.  From that, they commenced to envisage it as a totality, as no historian of one period or of a single people was likely to do, nor any analyst of his own type of civilization alone.  They became aware of culture as a "universe", or vast field in which we of today and our own civilization occupy only one place of many.  The result was a widening of a fundamental point of view, a departure from unconscious ethnocentricity toward relativity.  This shift from naive self-centeredness in one's own time and spot to a broader view based on objective comparison is somewhat like the change from the original geocentric assumption of astronomy to the Copernican interpretation of the solar system and the subsequent still greater widening to a universe of galaxies.}}

This conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as [[sociology]] and [[psychology]].

[[Ruth Benedict]], another of Boas's students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method.  Her book, ''Patterns of Culture'', did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that:

{{quote|The study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place any scientific study requires that there be no preferential weighting of one or another items in the series it selects for its consideration. In all the less controversial fields like the study of cacti or termites or the nature of nebulae, the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local variation, that of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1959 [1934] ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal.  In this context, cultural relativism is a [[heuristic]] device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity.

==As a critical device==
Marcus and Fischer's attention to anthropology's refusal to accept Western culture's claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique.  This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment:

{{quote|The other promise of anthropology, one less fully distinguished and attended to than the first, has been to serve as a form of cultural critique for ourselves.  In using portraits of other cultural patterns to reflect self-critically on our own ways, anthropology disrupts common sense and makes us reexamine our taken-for-granted assumptions.&lt;ref name="Michael M.J page 1"/&gt;}}

The critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that "It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may ''seem'' to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence ''seem'' to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, John, 1978. "Cultural Relativism as an Ethnocentric Notion", in ''The Philosophy of Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cook is misconstruing cultural relativism to be identical to [[moral relativism]], his point still applies to the broader understanding of the term.  Relativism does not mean that one's views are false, but it does mean that it is false to claim that one's views are self-evident.

The critical function was indeed one of the ends to which [[Ruth Benedict|Benedict]] hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is [[Margaret Mead]]'s dissertation research (under Boas) of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable.

As Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries.

==Comparison to moral relativism==
According to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood "more as a doctrine, or position, than as a method". As a consequence, people misinterpreted cultural relativism to mean that all cultures are both separate and equal, and that all value systems, however different, are equally valid. Thus, people came to use the phrase "cultural relativism" erroneously to signify "moral relativism".

People generally understand moral relativism to mean that there are no absolute or universal moral standards. The nature of anthropological research lends itself to the search for universal standards (standards found in all societies), but not necessarily absolute standards; nevertheless, people often confuse the two. In 1944 [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] (who studied at Harvard, but who admired and worked with Boas and his students) attempted to address this issue:

{{quote|The concept of culture, like any other piece of knowledge, can be abused and misinterpreted. Some fear that the principle of cultural relativity will weaken morality. "If the Bugabuga do it why can't we? It's all relative anyway." But this is exactly what cultural relativity does not mean.

The principle of cultural relativity does not mean that because the members of some savage tribe are allowed to behave in a certain way that this fact gives intellectual warrant for such behavior in all groups. Cultural relativity means, on the contrary, that the appropriateness of any positive or negative custom must be evaluated with regard to how this habit fits with other group habits. Having several wives makes economic sense among herders, not among hunters. While breeding a healthy scepticism as to the eternity of any value prized by a particular people, anthropology does not as a matter of theory deny the existence of moral absolutes. Rather, the use of the comparative method provides a scientific means of discovering such absolutes. If all surviving societies have found it necessary to impose some of the same restrictions upon the behavior of their members, this makes a strong argument that these aspects of the moral code are indispensable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kluckhohn, Clyde 1944 ''Mirror For Man''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/80-241/guided_inquiries/articles/cultural_rel.html | title=Cultural Relativism | author=Caleb Rosado}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Kluckholn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. "savage tribe") but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one's culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn's formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one's moral standards make sense in terms of one's culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another.  Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.

It was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat as some would call it, of cultural relativism's theoretical underpinnings by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture. 

Vertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history ("vertical" meaning passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures' belief systems or societal practices must be firmly
grounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future.

Horizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present ("horizontal" in time – meaning the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or
ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture's belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful.

The transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations]] in preparing the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Melville Herskovits prepared a draft "Statement on Human Rights" which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Board, American Anthropological Association 1947 "Statement on Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 49(4) 539-543&lt;/ref&gt; The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:

{{quote|The problem is thus to formulate a statement of human rights that will do more than phrase respect for the individual as individual. It must also take into full account the individual as a member of a social group of which he is part, whose sanctioned modes of life shape his behavior, and with whose fate his own is thus inextricably bound.
 
The bulk of this statement emphasizes concern that the Declaration of Human Rights was being prepared primarily by people from Western societies, and would express values that, far from being universal, are really Western:
 
Today the problem is complicated by the fact that the Declaration must be of world-wide applicability. It must embrace and recognize the validity of many different ways of life. It will not be convincing to the Indonesian, the African, the Chinese, if it lies on the same plane as like documents of an earlier period. The rights of Man in the Twentieth Century cannot be circumscribed by the standards of any single culture, or be dictated by the aspirations of any single people. Such a document will lead to frustration, not realization of the personalities of vast numbers of human beings.}}
 
Although this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims:
 
# Even where political systems exist that deny citizens the right of participation in their government, or seek to conquer weaker peoples, underlying cultural values may be called on to bring the peoples of such states to a realization of the consequences of the acts of their governments, and thus enforce a brake upon discrimination and conquest.
# Worldwide standards of freedom and justice, based on the principle that man is free only when he lives as his society defines freedom, that his rights are those he recognizes as a member of his society, must be basic.

These claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists.  Julian Steward (who, as a student of [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Robert Lowie]], and as a professor at [[Columbia University]], was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim "may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance", but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism: "Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance and conquest – political and economic as well as military – in all their forms." Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that anthropologists "approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste system of the United States, or many other varieties of social discrimination in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Steward, Julian 1948 "Comments on the Statement of Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(2) 351–352&lt;/ref&gt; Steward and others&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, H. G. "On Science and Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(2) 352–355. June 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals.

==Current debates==
The debates over the Statement on Human Rights, then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal. It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non-anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non-anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations.

Political scientist [[Alison Dundes Renteln]] has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Renteln, Alison 1988 "Relativism and the Search for Human Rights" in ''American Anthropologist'' 90(1) 56–72&lt;/ref&gt; Most philosophers understand the Benedictine–Herskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean

{{quote|what is right or good for one individual or society is not right or good for another, even if the situations are similar, meaning not merely that what is thought right or good by one is not thought right or good by another ... but that what is really right or good in one case is not so in another.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Frankena|Frankena, William]] 1973 ''Ethics''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: "there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Paul 1955 "Some Criticisms of Cultural Relativism" in ''Journal of Philosophy'' 52: 780–791&lt;/ref&gt;

Renteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: "the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture". This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views:

{{quote|There is no reason why the relativist should be paralyzed, as critics have often asserted.&lt;ref&gt;Hartung, Frank 1954 '"Cultural Relativity and Moral Judgements" in ''Philosophy of Science'' 21: 11–125&lt;/ref&gt; But a relativist will acknowledge that the criticism is based on his own ethnocentric standards and realizes also that the condemnation may be a form of [[cultural imperialism]].}}

Renteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual's own culture.

===Post-colonial politics===
Boas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture.  For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons.

===Political critique===
On the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, [[Stanley Diamond]] argued that when the term "cultural relativism" entered popular culture, popular culture coopted [[anthropology]] in a way that voided the principle of any critical function:

{{quote|Relativism is the bad faith of the conqueror, who has become secure enough to become a tourist.

Cultural relativism is a purely intellectual attitude; it does not inhibit the anthropologist from participating as a professional in his own milieu; on the contrary, it rationalizes that milieu. Relativism is self-critical only in the abstract. Nor does it lead to engagement. It only converts the anthropologist into a shadowy figure, prone to newsworthy and shallow pronouncements about the cosmic condition of the human race. It has the effect of mystifying the profession, so that the very term ''anthropologist'' ("student of man") commands the attention of an increasingly "popular" audience in search of novelty. But the search for self-knowledge, which [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] was the first to link to the annihilation of prejudice, is reduced to the experience of culture shock, a phrase used by both anthropologists and the State Department to account for the disorientation that usually follows an encounter with an alien way of life. But culture shock is a condition one recovers from; it is not experienced as an authentic redefinition of the personality but as a testing of its tolerance ... The tendency of relativism, which it never quite achieves, is to detach the anthropologist from all particular cultures. Nor does it provide him with a moral center, only a job.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Diamond 2004 [1974] ''In Search of the Primitive''  New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers page 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George W. Stocking, Jr.|George Stocking]] summarized this view with the observation that "Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. Jr., 1982. "Afterward: A View from the Center" in ''Ethnos'' 47: 172–286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense by Clifford Geertz===
On the other hand, the most common and popular criticisms of relativism come not from anthropologists like Stanley Diamond, but rather from political conservatives. By the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, [[Clifford Geertz]] pointed out that the conservative critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, 1984. "Anti-Anti-Relativism" in ''American Anthropologist'' 86 (2) 263–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were [[talking past each other|talking past one another]]. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life.

{{quote|The supposed conflict between Benedict's and Herskovits's call for tolerance and the untolerant passion with which they called for it turns out not to be the simple contradiction so many amateur logicians have held it to be, but the expression of a perception, caused by thinking a lot about Zunis and Dahomys, that the world being so full of a number of things, rushing to judgement is more than a mistake, it is a crime. Similarly, Kroeber's and Kluckholn's verities – Kroeber's were mostly about messy creatural matters like delirium and menstruation, Kluckholn's were mostly about messy social ones like lying and killing within the in-group, turn out not to be just the arbitrary personal obsessions they so much look like, but the expression of a much vaster concern, caused by thinking a lot about ''anthrōpos'' in general, that if something isn't anchored everywhere nothing can be anchored anywhere. Theory here – if that is what these earnest advices about how we must look at things if we are to be accounted as decent should be called – is more an exchange of warnings than an analytical debate.  We are being offered a choice of worries.

What the relativists – so-called – want us to worry about is provincialism – the danger that our perceptions will be dulled, our intellects constricted, and our sympathies narrowed by the overlearned and overvalued acceptances of our own society. What the anti-relativists – self-declared – want us to worry about, and worry about and worry about, as though our very souls depended on it, is a kind of spiritual entropy, a heat death of the mind, in which everything is as significant, and thus as insignificant, as everything else: anything goes, to each his own, you pays your money and you takes your choice, I know what I like, not in the couth, ''tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner''.}}

Geertz concludes this discussion by commenting, "As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world."

Geertz' defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment [[Alfred Kroeber]] made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred, 1949. "An Authoritarian Panacea" in ''American Anthropologist'' 51(2) 318–320&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Obviously, relativism poses certain problems when from trying merely to understand the world we pass on to taking action in the world: and right decisions are not always easy to find. However, it is also obvious that authoritarians who know the complete answers beforehand will necessarily be intolerant of relativism: they should be, if there is only one truth and that is theirs.

I admit that hatred of the intolerant for relativism does not suffice to make relativism true. But most of us are human enough for our belief in relativism to be somewhat reinforced just by that fact. At any rate, it would seem that the world has come far enough so that it is only by starting from relativism and its tolerations that we may hope to work out a new set of absolute values and standards, if such are attainable at all or prove to be desirable.}}

== Use by nations ==
Several nations have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], despite the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] rejecting it as a refugee of human rights violations. A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the [[Universal Periodic Review]]s, distinguishes several different groups of nations. One group consists of nations where the current regime has been installed by revolution and that deny the need for political plurality: [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Cuba]] and [[Iran]]. Another group are certain [[Islamic]] nations that adhere to [[sharia]] and certain traditional practices: [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]]. A third possible group is nations that give special rights to specific groups: [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lloret Blackburn, Cultural Relativism in the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council, ICIP Working Papers 2011/3, Institut Català Internacional per la Pau, Barcelona, September 2011, http://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/-blackburn_upr_cultural_relativism.09.2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24060">'''Ethnic identity development''' or '''ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development''' includes the [[identity formation]] in an individual's [[self-identification|self-categorization]] in, and psychological attachment to, (an) [[ethnic]] group(s).  Ethnic identity is characterized as part of one’s overarching [[self-concept]] and [[Identity (social science)|identification]]. It is distinct from the [[ethnogenesis|development of ethnic group identities]].

With some few exceptions, ethnic and racial identity development is associated positively with good psychological outcomes, psychosocial outcomes (e.g., better self-beliefs, less depressive symptoms), academic outcomes (e.g., better engagement in school), and health outcomes (e.g., less risk of [[risky sexual behavior]] or drug use).

Development of ethnic identity begins during adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=Sabine Elizabeth|last2=Seidman|first2=Edward|last3=Allen|first3=LaRue|last4=Aber|first4=J. Lawrence|title=The development of ethnic identity during adolescence.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.1|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is described as a process of the construction of identity over time&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; due to a combination of experience and actions of the individual&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"&gt;Phinney, J. S. &amp; Ong, A.D. (2007). Conceptualization and measurement of ethnic identity: Current status and future directions. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology, 54,'' 271-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes gaining knowledge and understanding of [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group(s)]], as well as a sense of belonging to (an) ethnic group(s). It is important to note that given the vastly different histories of various racial groups, particularly in the United States, that ethnic and racial identity development looks very different between different groups, especially when looking at minority (e.g., Black American) compared to majority (e.g., White American) group comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=1995|title=An update of Helm's White and people of color racial identity models|url=|journal=Annual Multicultural Winter Roundtable|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity is sometimes interchanged with, held distinct from, or considered as overlapping with [[racial identity|racial]], [[cultural identity|cultural]] and even [[National identity|national identities]]. This disagreement in the distinction (or lack thereof) between these concepts may originate from the incongruity of definitions of race and ethnicity, as well as the historic conceptualization of models and research surrounding ethnic and racial identity.  Research on racial identity development emerged from the experiences of African Americans during the civil rights movement, however expanded over time to include the experiences of other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Wij"&gt;Wijeyesinghe, C. L., &amp; Jackson, B. W. (2001). New perspectives on racial identity development. New York: NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of racial identity is often misunderstood and can have several meanings which are derived from biological dimensions and social dimensions. Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual's physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.&lt;ref name="Chá"&gt;Chávez, A. F. and Guido-DiBrito, F. (1999), Racial and Ethnic Identity and Development. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 1999: 39–47. doi: 10.1002/ace.8405&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Generally, group level processes of ethnic identity have been explored by [[social science]] disciplines, including [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. In contrast, [[ethnic identity]] research within [[psychology]] usually focuses on the individual and interpersonal processes.  Within psychology, ethnic identity is typically studied by social, developmental and cross-cultural psychologists.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Phinney, J. Ethnic identity. In A. Kazdin (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 255-259). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models of ethnic development emerged both social and developmental psychology, with different theoretical roots.

===Roots in social psychology===
Ethnic identity emerged in social psychology out of [[social identity theory]]. Social identity theory posits that belonging to social groups (e.g. religious groups or occupational groups) serves an important basis for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="Tajfel"&gt;Tajfel, H. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1986). The social identity theory of inter-group behavior. In S. Worchel &amp; L. W. Austin (Eds.), Psychology of Intergroup Relations. Chicago: Nelson-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in a group(s), as well as one’s value and emotional significance attached to this membership, is an important part of one’s self-concept. One of the earliest statements of social identity was made by [[Kurt Lewin]], who
emphasized that individuals need a firm sense of group identification
in order to maintain a sense of well-being.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Lewin, K. (1948). ''Resolving social conflicts''. New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social identity theory emphasizes a need to maintain a positive sense of self. Therefore in respect to ethnic identity, this underscores affirmation to and salience of ethnic group membership(s). In light of this, affirmation of ethnicity has been proposed to be more salient among groups who have faced greater discrimination, in order to maintain self-esteem. There has also been research on family influences, such as cultural values of the family. Also, specific aspects of parenting, such as their racial socialization of youth, can contribute to the socialization of adolescents.&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Chao, R. K., &amp; Otsuki-Clutter, M. (2011). Racial and Ethnic Differences: Sociocultural and 
Contextual Explanations. Journal of Research on Adolescence (Blackwell Publishing Limited), 21(1), 47-60. doi:10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00714.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatedly, [[collective identity]] is an overarching framework for different types of identity development, emphasizing the multidimensionality of group membership.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"&gt;Ashmore, R. D., Deaux, K., &amp; McLaughlin-Volpe, T. (2004). An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 130, 80-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of collective identity includes positioning oneself psychologically in a group to which you share some characteristic(s). This positioning does not require individuals to have direct contact with all members of the group. The collective identity framework has been related to ethnic identity development, particularly in recognizing the importance of personal identification of ethnicity through categorical membership. Collective identity also includes evaluation of one’s category.&lt;ref name="Ashmore" /&gt; This affective dimension is related to the importance of commitment and attachment toward one’s ethnic group(s).  A behavioral component of collective identity recognizes that individuals reflect group membership through individual actions, such as language usage, in respect to ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"/&gt;

===Roots in developmental psychology===
Identity becomes especially salient during adolescence as recognized by [[Erik Erikson]]’s stage theory of psychosocial development.  An individual faces a specific developmental crisis at each stage of development. In adolescence, identity search and development are critical tasks during what is termed the ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’ stage.
&lt;ref name="Erikson"&gt;Erikson, E.H.(1968). Identity, youth, and crisis. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
Achievement of this stage ultimately leads to a stable sense of self.  The idea of an achieved identity includes reconciling identities imposed on oneself with one’s need to assert control and seek out an identity that brings satisfaction, feelings of industry and competence. In contrast, identity confusion occurs when individuals fail to achieve a secure identity, and lack clarity about their role in life.

[[James Marcia]] elaborated on Erik Erikson’s model to include identity formation in a variety of life domains.  Marcia’s focus of identity formation includes two processes which can be applied to ethnic identity development: an exploration of identity and a commitment.&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;Marcia, J.E. (1991). Identity  and self development.  In R. Lerner, A. Peterson, &amp; J. Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence''(Vol.1). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia defines four identity statuses which combines the presence or absence of the processes of exploration and commitment: Identity diffusion (not engaged in exploration or commitment), identity foreclosure (a lack of exploration, yet committed), moratorium (process of exploration without having made a commitment), and identity achievement (exploration and commitment of identity).

Researchers believe and have frequently reported that older individuals are more likely to be in an achieved identity status than younger people. Evidence shows that increasing age and a wide range of life experiences helps individuals develop cognitive skills. This combination of age, life experiences, and improved cognitive skills helps adolescents and young adults find their authentic selves.&lt;ref name="Bra"&gt;Branch, C. (2001). The many faces of self: ego and ethnic identities. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 162(4), 412-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescents with strong commitments to their ethnic identities also tend to explore these identities more than their peers.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;Meeus, Wim.  (2011).  The study of adolescent identity formation 2000-2010: a review of longitudinal research.  In Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21(1), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors during adolescence ==
While children in early to middle childhood develop the ability to categorize themselves and others using racial and ethnic labels, it is largely during adolescence that ethnic and racial identity develops.

== Phinney's model of ethnic identity development ==

[[Jean Phinney]]’s model of ethnic identity development is a multidimensional model, with theoretical underpinnings of both Erikson and Marcia.&lt;ref name="Phinney"&gt;Phinney, J. S. (1990). Ethnic identity in adolescents and adults: A review of research. &lt;em&gt;Psychological
Bulletin, 108&lt;/em&gt;, 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phinney1989"&gt;Phinney, J. (1989). Stages of ethnic identity in minority group adolescents.
Journal of Early Adolescence, 9, 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Erikson's identity formation, Phinney focuses on the adolescent, acknowledging significant changes during this time period, including greater abilities in cognition to contemplate ethnic identity, as well as a broader exposure outside of their own community,  a greater focus on one's social life, and an increased concern for physical appearance.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;

Phinney's Three Stage Progression: 
*Unexamined Ethnic Identity – Prior to adolescence, children either give ethnicity little thought (related to Marcia's diffuse status) or are assumed to have derived their ethnic identity from others, rather than engaging in personal examination. This is related to Marcia's foreclosed identity status.  Knowledge of one's ethnicity is "absorbed", which reflects the process of [[socialization]].
Broadly, socialization in the context of ethnic identity development refers to the acquisition of behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group(s).&lt;ref name="Rotherman"&gt;Rotherman, M., &amp; Phinney, J. (1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney &amp; M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This process recognizes that feelings about one’s ethnic group(s) can be influenced by family, peers, community, and larger society. These contextual systems or networks of influence delineate from [[ecological systems theory]].  These systems influence children’s feelings of belonging and overall affect toward ethnic group(s). Children may internalize both positive and negative messages and therefore hold conflicting feelings about ethnicity. Socialization highlights how early experiences for children are considered crucial in regards to their ethnic identity development.

*Ethnic Identity Search- During the onset of adolescence, there is a questioning of accepted views of ethnicity and a greater understanding of ethnicity in a more abstract sense. Typically this stage has been characterized as being initiated by a significant experience that creates heightened awareness of ethnicity, such as discrimination. Engagement in some form of exploration includes an interest in learning more about one's culture and actively involving oneself in activities such as talking with others about ethnicity, reading books on the subject, and thinking about both the current and future effects of one's ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; This stage is related to Erikson's ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’, and Marcia's moratorium.
*Ethnic Identity Achievement- This stage is characterized by clarity about one’s ethnic identity. The achievement phase includes a secure, confident, and stable sense of self.  Achievement also is characterized as a realistic assessment of one's in-group(s) in a larger social context.  In essence, the individual has internalized their ethnicity.This stage is related to Erikson's achieved identity, and identity achievement of Marcia. Identity achievement is also related to social identity theory in that this acceptance replaces one's negative ethnic self-image.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;  Although achievement represents the highest level of ethnic identity development, it should be noted that Phinney believes reexamination can occur depending on experiences over time.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

More recently, Phinney has focused on the continuous dimensions of one's exploration and commitment to one's ethnic group(s), rather than on distinct identity statuses.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

==Applications==
Research reveals ethnic identity development is related to psychological well-being.  Ethnic identity has been linked with positive self-evaluation&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, M.L., Way, N., Pahl, K. (2006). Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: Patterns and psychological correlates. ''Developmental Psychology, 42'', 218-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic identity development has also been shown to serve as a buffer between perceived discrimination and depression.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, L., &amp; Ong, A. D. (2010). A daily diary investigation of Latino ethnic identity, discrimination, and depression. ''Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 16''(4), 561-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, commitment of an ethnic identity may help to abate depressive symptoms experienced soon after experiencing discrimination, which in turn alleviates overall stress. Researchers posit commitment to an ethnic identity group(s) is related to additional resources accumulated through the exploration process, including social support.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;   
Ethnic identity development has been linked to happiness and decreased anxiety.  Specifically, regard for one’s ethnic group may buffer normative stress.&lt;ref name="Kiang"&gt;Kiang, L., Yip, T., Gonzales-Backen, M., Witkow, M., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2006). Ethnic identity and the daily psychological well-being of adolescents from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds. ''Child Development, 77''(5), 1338-1350.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show many positive outcomes associated with strong and stable ethnic identities, including increased self-esteem, improved mental health, decreased self-destructive behaviors, and greater academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Ort"&gt;Ortiz, A. M., &amp; Santos, S. J. (2010). Campus diversity and ethnic identity development. Diversity and Democracy, 13(2), 5-7. Retrieved from http://www.diversityweb.org/DiversityDemocracy/vol13no2/ortiz.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that ethnic identity exploration may be related to vulnerability to negative outcomes, such as depression.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;  Findings suggest this is due to an individual’s sensitivity to awareness of discrimination and conflicts of positive and negative images of ethnicity during exploration. Also, while commitment to an ethnic group(s) is related to additional resources, exploration is related to a lack of ready-access resources.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;

Studies have found that in terms of family cohesion, the closer adolescents felt to their parents, the more they reported feeling connected to their ethnic group. Given the family is a key source of ethnic socialization, closeness with the family may highly overlap with closeness with one’s ethnic group. Resources like family cohesion, proportion of same-ethnic peers, and ethnic centrality act as correlates of within-person change in ethnic identity, but it is only on the individual level and not as adolescents as a group.&lt;ref name="Kia"&gt;Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., Baldelomar, O. A., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2010). Change in Ethnic Identity Across the High School Years Among Adolescents with Latin American, Asian, and European Backgrounds. Journal of Youth &amp; Adolescence,39(6),683-693. doi:10.1007/s10964-009-9429-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
Ethnic identity development has been conceptualized and researched primarily within the United States.  Due to the fact the individuals studied are typically from the United States, it may not be appropriate to extend findings or models to individuals in other countries. Some research has been conducted outside of the United States, however a majority of these studies were in Europe or countries settled by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

Further, researchers also suggest that racial and ethnic identity development must be viewed, studied, and considered alongside the other normative developmental processes (e.g., [[gender identity]] development) and cannot be considered in a vacuum - racial and ethnic identity exist in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Joanna Lee|last2=Tolan|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Durkee|first3=Myles I.|last4=Francois|first4=, Amir G.|last5=Anderson|first5=Riana E.|date=2012-09-01|title=Integrating Racial and Ethnic Identity Research Into Developmental Understanding of Adolescents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=304–311|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Research considers some studies of ethnic developments cross-sectional in design. This type of design pales in comparison to longitudinal design whose topic of investigation is developmental in nature. This is because cross-sectional studies collect data at or around the same time from multiple individuals of different ages of interest, instead of collecting data over multiple time points for each individual in the study, which would allow the researcher to compare change for individuals over time, as well as differences between individuals.

Another research consideration in the field is why certain ethnic and racial groups are looking towards their own expanding community for mates instead of continuing interracial marriages. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that Asian-American couples have been kicking the trend and finding Asian mates because it gives them resurgence of interest in language and ancestral traditions.&lt;ref name="Swarns"&gt;Swarns, R. L. (2012, March 30). For Asian-American Couples, a Tie That Binds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/fashion/more-asian-americans-marrying-within-their-race.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further research can be found and explored throughout the many different racial and ethnic groups.

Some researchers question the number of dimensions of ethnic identity development. For example, some measures of ethnic identity development include measures of behaviors, such as eating ethnic food or participating in customs specific to an ethnic group.   One argument is that  while behaviors oftentimes express identity, and are typically correlated with identity, ethnic identity is an internal structure that can exist without behavior.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong" /&gt; It has been suggested one can be clear and confident about one's ethnicity, without wanting to maintain customs.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; Others have found evidence of a behavioral component of ethnic identity development, separate from cognition and affect, and pertaining to one's ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Gaines"&gt;Gaines, S.O., Bunce, D., Robertson, T., Wright, B. (2010). Evaluating the psychometric properties  of  the Multigroup Ethic Identity Measure (MEIM) within the United Kingdom. ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research, 10,'' 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity development points toward the importance of allowing an individual to self-identify ethnicity during data collection.  This method helps us collect the most accurate and relevant information about the subjective identification of the participant, and can be useful in particular with respect to research with multiethnic individuals.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

'''Ethnogenesis''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''ethnos'' {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}}, "group of people, [[nation]]", and ''genesis'' {{lang|grc|γένεσις}}, "beginning, coming into being"; plural '''ethnogeneses''') is "the formation and development of an ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethnogenesis].&lt;/ref&gt; This can originate through a process of self-identification as well as come about as the result of outside identification.

The term is a mid-20th century neologism, refers to the observable phenomenon of emergence of new social groups that are identified as having a cohesive identity, i.e. an "ethnic group" in anthropological terms. Relevant sciences do not only observe this phenomenon but search for explanation of its causes. The term ''ethnogeny'' is also used as a variant of ''ethnogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39846744/Ethnogesesis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1527883691&amp;Signature=DnTxPmqi06w8%2BLfDbc2qeyg409E%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEthnogenesis_A_Contested_Model_of_Early.pdf Andrew Gillett, "Ethnogenesis: A Contested Model of Early Medieval Europe", ''History Compass'' 4/2 (2006): 241–260 p. 244.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive or active ethnogenesis==
Ethnogenesis can occur passively, in the accumulation of markers of group identity forged through interaction with the physical environment, cultural and religious divisions between sections of a society, migrations and other processes, for which ethnic subdivision is an unintended outcome. It can occur actively, as persons deliberately and directly 'engineer' separate identities to attempt to solve a political problem – the preservation or imposition of certain cultural values, power relations, etc.  Since the late eighteenth century, such attempts have often been related to [[language]] revival or creation of a new language, in what eventually becomes a "[[national literature]]".

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, societies challenged by the obsolescence of those [[narrative]]s which previously afforded them coherence have fallen back on ethnic or racial narratives as a means of maintaining or reaffirming their collective identity, or ''polis''.&lt;ref&gt;Geary, Patrick J. ''The Myth of Nations: The Medieval Origins of Europe.'' Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusive or exclusive nationalism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Ethnogenesis can be promoted to include or exclude any ethnic minority living within a certain country. In [[France]], the integrationalist policy of the [[French Republic]] was inclusive; their laws stated all persons born or legally residing in France proper (including overseas departments and territories) were "Frenchmen".  The law did not make any ethnic distinctions nor racial categories in between the "French" people. All people in France were Frenchmen and became citizens of the French Republic as far the country's law was concerned.

==Language revival==
Language has been a critical asset for authenticating ethnic identities.  The process of reviving an antique ethnic identity often poses an immediate language challenge, as obsolescent languages  lack expressions for contemporary experiences.  In Europe in the 1990s, examples of proponents of ethnic revivals were from [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] fringes in [[Wales]] and nationalists in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].  Activists' attempts since the 1970s to revive the [[Occitan language]] in [[Southern France]] are a similar example.

Similarly, in the 19th century, the [[Fennoman]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] aimed to raise the [[Finnish language]] from peasant-status to the position of an official national language, which had been only [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for some time.  The Fennoman also founded the [[Finnish Party]] to pursue their nationalist aims. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish [[national epic]], ''[[Kalevala]]'', was a founding stone of Finnish nationalism and ethnogenesis.  Finnish was recognized as the [[official language]] of Finland only in 1892.  Fennomans were opposed by the [[Svecomans]], headed by [[Axel Olof Freudenthal]] (1836–1911).  He supported continuing the use of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as the official language; it had been a minority language used by the educated elite in government and administration. In line with contemporary [[scientific racism]] theories, Freudenthal believed that Finland had two "[[race (historical definition)|races]]", one speaking Swedish and the other Finnish. The Svecomans claimed that the Swedish "Germanic race" was superior to the majority Finnish people. In [[Ireland]], revival of the [[Irish language]] was part of the reclaiming of [[Irish people|Irish]] identity in the republic.

Language has been an important and divisive political force in [[Belgium]] between the Dutch and Germanic [[Flemings]] and Franco-Celtic [[Walloons]] since the kingdom was created in 1831. [[Switzerland]] is divided among Alemannic [[ethnic German|German-speaking]] or ''[[Swiss German|Deutschschweizer]]'' against the [[French Swiss|French-speaking]] ''Romands'' or Arpitians, and the [[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Lombard language|Lombard]] and [[Romansch language|Romansh]]-speaking minorities in the south and east.

In [[Italy]], there were ethnological and linguistic differences between regional groups, from the [[Lombardy|Lombardians]] of the North to the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]] of the south.  Mountainous terrain had allowed the development of relatively isolated communities and numerous dialects and languages before unification in the 19th century.

==Religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}
The set of cultural markers that accompanies each of the major [[religion]]s may become a component of distinct ethnic identities, but they almost never exist in isolation.  Ethnic definitions are subject to change over time, both within and outside groups. For example, 19th-century Europeans classified Jews and Arabs as one 'ethnic' bloc, the [[Semitic people|Semites]] or [[Hamitic|Hamites]]. Later, the term Hamites came to be associated with [[Sub-Saharan African]]s instead.

Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim followers have historically been aligned with ethnicities (and later nations) speaking different languages and having different cultures that arise on the basis of the languages that followers of each religion historically favoured:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ([[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], respectively). The sources of religious differentiation are contested among [[sociology of religion|sociologists]] and among [[anthropology of religion|anthropologists]], as much as between the faith groups themselves.

The line between a well-defined religious [[sect]] and a discrete ethnicity cannot always be sharply defined. Sects that most observers would accept as constituting a separate ethnicity usually have, as a minimum, a firm set of rules related to maintenance of [[endogamy]], censuring those who 'marry out' or who fail to raise their children in the proper faith. Examples might include the [[Amish]], [[Druze]], [[Mormons]], [[Sikh]]s, [[Yazidi]] and [[Zoroastrians]]&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison]], p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geographical factors can lead to both cultural and [[Genetics|genetic]] isolation from larger human societies.  Groups which settle remote habitats and intermarry over generations will acquire distinctive cultural and genetic traits, evolving from cultural continuity and through interaction with their unique environmental circumstances.  Ethnogenesis in these circumstances typically results in an identity that is less value-laden than one forged in contradistinction to competing populations.  Particularly in [[pastoral]] mountain peoples, social organization tends to hinge primarily on familial identification, not a wider [[collective identity]].

== Specific cases ==

===Ancient Greeks===
[[Anthony D. Smith]] notes that in general there is a lack of evidence which hampers the assessement of existence of nations or nationalisms in antiquity. The two cases where more evidence exists are those of ancient Greece and Israel. In Ancient Greece a cultural rather than political unity is observed. Yet, there were ethnic divisions within the wider Hellenic ethnic community, mainly the divisions between Ionians, Aeolians, Boeotians and Dorians. These groups were further divided into   city-states. Smith postulates that there is no more than a semblance of nationalism in ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?hl=el&amp;lr=&amp;id=bEAJbHBlXR8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ancient+greek+national+identity&amp;ots=fMkUNma1Fm&amp;sig=t3tg_wUoqqk70ONPdh13NuuwVZs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Greece&amp;f=false Anthony D. Smith, National Identity, University of Nevada Press, 1991, pp  47, 48]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan M. Hall]]'s work “Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity” (1997), was acclaimed as the first full-length modern study on Ancient Greek ethnicity. According to Hall, Ancient Greek ethnic identity was much based on kinship, descent and genealogy, which was reflected in elaborate genealogy myths. On his view, genealogy is the most fundamental way any population defines itself as an ethnic group. There was a change in the way Greeks constructed their ethnic identity in the Persian Wars period (first half of  5th c BC). Before that (archaic period) Greeks tended to attach themselves to one another by a process of genealogical assimilation. After the Persian invasion, they tended to define themselves against the enemy they perceived as the barbarian “other”. An indication of this disposition is the Athenians' speech to their allies in 480 BC, mentioning that all Hellenes are bound with the ''homaimon'' (“same blood”), ''homoglosson'' (same language) and common religious practices. Hall believes that Hellenic identity was clearly envisaged in the 6th c. BC as being ethnic in character, cultural forms of identification emerged in the 5th century, and there is evidence that by the 4th century this identity was conceived more in cultural terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-26.html Jonathan M. Hall, Hellenicity: Between Ethnicity and Culture.   University of Chicago Press, 2002.  Pp. 312.   Reviewed by Kathryn Lomas, Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.04.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goths ===
Herwig Wolfram offers "a radically new explanation of the circumstances under which the [[Goths]] were settled in [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Italy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr.''History of the Goths'' (1979, 1988) Preface, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Since "they dissolved at their downfall into a myth accessible to everyone" at the head of a long history of attempts to lay claim to a "Gothic" tradition, the ethnogenesis by which disparate bands came to self-identify as "Goths" is of wide interest and application. The problem is in extracting a [[ethnohistory|historical ethnography]] from sources that are resolutely Latin and Roman-oriented.

=== American Indian North American Southwest ===
With the arrival of the Spanish in southwestern North America, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Jumano]] cultural sphere underwent social changes partly in reaction, which spurred their ethnogenesis, Clayton Anderson has observed.&lt;ref&gt;See Clayton Anderson, ''The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press) 1999; a broader scope is included in the articles in  Jonathan D. Hill (ed.), ''History, Power, and Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Americas, 1492-1992'', (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnogenesis in the [[Texas Plains]] and along the coast took two forms: a disadvantaged group identified with a stronger group and became absorbed into it, on the one hand, and on the other hand, cultural institutions were modified and in a sense reinvented. The 17th-century Jumano disintegration, a collapse in part by the widespread deaths from introduced diseases, was followed by their reintegration as [[Kiowa]], Nancy Hickerson has argued.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Parrott Hickerson, ''The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains'' (University of Texas Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exterior stresses that produced ethnogenetic shifts preceded the arrival of the Spanish and their horse culture: recurring cycles of drought had previously forced non-kin to band together or to disband and mobilize. Intertribal hostilities forced weaker groups to associate with stronger ones.

=== Southeastern North American Indians===
From 1539 to 1543, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] departed [[Cuba]] for [[Florida]] and the [[American Southeast]].  Although asked to practice restraint, Soto led 600 men on a violent rampage through present-day Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and East Texas. Frustrated with not finding gold or silver in the areas suspected to contain such valuable materials, they destroyed villages and decimated native populations. Despite his death in 1542, Soto's men continued their expedition until 1543 when about half of their original force reached Mexico. Their actions introduced European diseases that further weakened native populations.  The population collapse forced natives to relocate from their cities into the countryside, where smaller villages and new political structures developed, replacing the older chiefdom models of tribal governance. By 1700, the major tribal settlements Soto and his men had encountered were no more.  Smaller tribes began to form loose confederations of smaller, more autonomous villages. From that blending of many tribes, ethnogenesis led to the emergence of new ethnic groups and identities for the consolidated natives who had managed to survive the invasion of European people, animals, and diseases.  After 1700, most North American Indian "tribes" were relatively new composite groups formed by these refugees who were trying to cope with massive epidemics and violence brought by the Europeans who were exploring the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=American Colonies:  The Settling of North America|date=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200210-0|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North American Aboriginals in the Canadian West ===
The bringing of disease by the Europeans redistributed the indigenous communities and this caused a lot of war, disagreements (since they were going into each other's land and sacred areas), and a rise in mortality rates. Some Aboriginal groups were destroyed while some began to band together and create new Aboriginal groups within these areas of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840250989|title=Clearing the Plains : disease, politics of starvation, and the loss of Aboriginal life|last=1961-|first=Daschuk, James W. (James William),|isbn=9780889772960|location=Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada|oclc=840250989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of Moldovan identity ===
The separate [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] ethnic identification was promoted under Soviet rule when the Soviet Union set up an autonomous [[Moldavian ASSR|Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1924. It was set apart from the [[Ukrainian SSR]] on part of the territory between the [[Dniester]] and [[Southern Bug]] rivers ([[Transnistria]]). The scholar Charles King concluded&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture'', Hoover Institution Press, 2000:54.&lt;/ref&gt; that this action was in part a prop to Soviet propaganda and help for a potential communist revolution in Romania. At first, a Moldovan ethnicity supported territorial claims to the then-Romanian territories of [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]]. The claims were based on the fact that the territory of eastern Bessarabia with Chisinau had belonged to the Russian Empire between 1812 and 1918. After having been for 500 years part of the Romanian Principality of Moldova, Russia was awarded the East of Moldova as a recompensation for its losses during the Napoleonic Wars: that was the beginning of the 100 years Russian history in East Moldova. After the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet occupation of the two territories in 1940]], potential reunification claims were offset by the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. At the establishment of the Moldaivan ASSR, Chișinău was named its capital, a role which it continued to play after the formation of the [[Moldavian SSR]] in 1940.

The recognition of [[Moldovans]] as a separate ethnicity, distinct from [[Romanians]], remains today a controversial subject. On one side, the Moldovan Parliament adopted in 2003 "The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova", which states that Moldovans and Romanians are two distinct peoples and speak two different languages, Romanians form an ethnic minority in Moldova, and the Republic of Moldova is the legitimate successor to the Principality of Moldavia. However, Moldovans are recognized as a distinct ethnic group only by former Soviet states.

Moreover, in Romania, people from Wallachia and Transylvania call the Romanians inhabiting western Moldavia, now part of Romania, as Moldovans. People in Romanian Moldova call themselves Moldovans, as subethnic denomination, and Romanians, as ethnic denomination (like Kentish and English for English people living in Kent). Romanians from Romania call the Romanians of the Republic of Moldova Bessarabians, as identification inside the subethnic group, Moldovans as subethnic group and Romanians as ethnic group. The subethnic groups referred to here are historically connected to independent Principalities. The Principality of Moldavia/Moldova founded in 1349 had various extensions between 1349 and 1859 and comprised Bucovina and Bessarabia as regional subdivisions. That way, Romanians of southern Bukovina (today part of Romania and formerly part of the historical Moldova) are called Bukovinans, Moldovans and Romanians.

In the [[2004 Moldovan Census]], of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) chose Romanian as their mother tongue, and 60% chose Moldovan. While 40% of all [[urban area|urban]] Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their mother tongue, in the countryside, barely one out of seven Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro Census 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020813/http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical scholarship==
Within the historical profession, the term "ethnogenesis" has been borrowed as a [[neologism]] to explain the origins and evolution of so-called [[barbarian]] ethnic cultures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Pohl]]. "Aux origines d'une Europe ethnique. Transformations d'identites entre Antiquite et Moyen Age". ''Annales HSS'' 60 (2005): 183-208, and Pohl, "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies" ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp 13-24.([http://www.kroraina.com/bulgar/pohl_etnicity.html  On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; stripped of its metaphoric connotations drawn from biology, of "natural" birth and growth. That view is closely associated with the Austrian historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] and his followers, who argued that such ethnicity was not a matter of genuine genetic descent ("tribes").

Rather, using Reinhard Wenskus' term ''Traditionskerne'' ("nuclei of tradition"),&lt;ref&gt;Wenskus' comparative study of German ethnogeneses is ''Stammesbildung und Verfassung'' (Cologne and Graz) 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ethnogenesis arose from small groups of aristocratic warriors carrying ethnic traditions from place to place and generation to generation. Followers would coalesce or disband around these nuclei of tradition; ethnicities were available to those who wanted to participate in them with no requirement of being born into a "tribe". Thus, questions of race and place of origin became secondary.

Proponents of ethnogenesis may claim it is the only alternative to the sort of [[ethnocentric]] and [[historiography and nationalism|nationalist scholarship]] that is commonly seen in disputes over the origins of many ancient peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Goths]], and [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kulikowski]] (2006). ''Rome's Gothic Wars''. Cambridge University Press. Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been used as an alternative to the Near East's "race history" that had supported [[Phoenicianism]] and claims to the antiquity of the variously called [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people]]s.

'''''Europe and the People Without History''''' is a book by [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Eric Wolf]].  First published in 1982, it focuses on the expansion of European [[society|societies]] in the [[Modern Era]]. "Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A global history==
The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from [[World-systems theory|World Systems theory]] in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, [[Fur trade in North America|fur]] and [[Slave trade in Africa|slave trades]].  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American south and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode of production analysis==
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11196">A '''genderless language''' is a [[natural language|natural]] or [[constructed language|constructed]] [[language]] that has no distinctions of [[grammatical gender]]—that is, no categories requiring [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between nouns and associated pronouns, adjectives, articles, or verbs.&lt;ref name=braun1&gt;[[Yasir Suleiman]] (ed.) (1999) "Language and Society in the Middle East and North Africa", {{ISBN|0-7007-1078-7}}, Chapter 10: "Gender in a genderless language: The case of Turkish", by Friederike Braun&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "genderless language" must not be confused with that of [[gender-neutral language]]. Also, a discourse in a genderless language is not necessarily [[gender-neutral]],&lt;ref name=braun1/&gt; although genderless languages exclude many possibilities for reinforcement of [[gender]]-related stereotypes, such as using masculine pronouns when referring to persons by their occupations (although some languages that may be identified as genderless, including [[Gender in English|English]], do have distinct male and female pronouns). A lack of gendered pronouns is also distinct from a lack of gender in the grammatical sense.

Genderless languages do have various means to recognize gender, such as gender-specific words (''mother'', ''son'', etc., and distinct pronouns such as ''he'' and ''she'' in some cases), as well as gender-specific context, both biological and cultural.&lt;ref name=braun1/&gt;

Genderless languages are listed at [[List of languages by type of grammatical genders]]. Genderless languages include the [[Indo-European languages]] [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Central Kurdish|Central Kurdish (Sorani Dialect)]], all the [[Uralic languages]] (such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), all the modern [[Turkic languages]] (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], all the [[Austronesian languages]] (such as the [[Polynesian languages]]), and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

== Language contact ==

=== Morphological view ===
From the morphological point of view, grammatical gender may arise because of [[language contact]].  These were called "universal simplifications" in the reduction of sex system.{{Incomprehensible inline|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuteva|first1=Bernd Heine ; Tania|title=Language contact and grammatical change|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521608282|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2017}} Surveys about [[gender systems]] around the world from 256 languages show that 112 (44%) are grammatical gender and 144 languages (56%) are genderless languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(eds.)|first1=Martine Vanhove ...|title=Morphologies in Contact.|date=2012|publisher=Akademie Verlag Berlin|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3050057019|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these two types of languages in many cases are geographically close to each other, there is a significant chance that one influences the other. For example, the [[Basque language]] is considered a genderless language, but it has been influenced by the Spanish feminine-masculine [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|two-gender]] system. Although it should be noted, there are 6909 recognized languages in the world, thus a sample of 256 languages constitutes roughly 3.7% of all spoken languages. Thus, although this particular survey indicates a high proportion of gender neutrality, it does not take into account the other 96.3% of languages.

=== Loaned from other languages ===
Gender has been associated with words but not with ideas. Scholars are trying to study the development of gender in nouns that have been borrowed from other languages. One example of this innovation is the gender assignment of the genderless English nouns that were borrowed into the Italian spoken by immigrants to America. The phonological form of the loaned word sometimes determines its sex. For example, Italians who immigrated to America do not identify the word freezer, but instead heard "freezə." This sound is similar to schwa /a/, so the word becomes "frisa." Consequently, the new word ends in /a/ which is feminine. The same happens with the words water (la vuora), the sweater (la suera), and the quarter (la quora). This process happens also in American-German and American-French. In English words ending in -ing, it sounds like French -ine and in German -ung which are feminine suffixes. In this case, the genderless nouns do not generate one gender or another. In the American-Italian language, masculine gender is the default gender. This default automatically happens in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Norwegian, and Old English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabeno|first1=Angela|last2=Repetti|first2=Lori|title=Gender Assignment of English Loan Words in American Varieties of Italian|journal=American Speech|date=undefined NaN|volume=72|issue=4|pages=373|doi=10.2307/455494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===

While English is virtually gender free grammatically as compared with German or French, it is not a genderless language. The elaborate grammatical gender of Old English has mostly disappeared in Modern English but it still remains in pronouns and possessive adjectives: He, him, his. She, her, hers. There is however no grammatical distinction with verbs, adjectives or nouns. Persian (Farsi), a related language in the Indo-European language family altogether lacks grammatical gender lacking the few vestigial remnants that English has which explains how Persian is a genderless language while English is not.

The villages of '''Großwilsdorf''' and the Rödel Plateau are situated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the middle of [[Germany]].  It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts (Deutsch-Slawische Forschungen zur Namenkunde und Siedlungsgeschichte 26).|date=1971|publisher=Berlin|language=German|trans-title=The history of names in the settlement in the area of the Saale and the Elbeuntil the end of the 9th century (German-Slav research on the history of names and settlements 26).|author=Walter, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sandstone,_Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hereditary witch''' is one who is born into a tradition of esoteric origin. These traditions are often not recorded, except maybe in [[grimoire]]s which are also passed down, but rely primarily on oral and physical tradition.

Hereditary Witches are generational in that their skills in magic are passed down from one generation to another.  Most tend to be solitaires with traditional, British, Mexican, Italian, Stegheria, or pecti-witan upbringing. The Hereditary Witch is most common in parts of the world where families live together most of their lives for generations and community services such as education and health services have remained inaccessible over several years such as Africa, the far northern regions of Scotland, remote regions of  Ireland and Wales, island provinces such as Bali, etc.

*In America, Appalachian "granny witches" also pass down their skills and craft to their daughters. So, in this way, many granny witches are also hereditary witches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8312">The '''history of mentalities''' is a [[calque]] of the [[French language|French]] term ''histoire des mentalités'', which might also be translated as "[[history]] of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s", "[[mindset]]s" or "[[world-view]]s". The term describes a particular manner of researching history. This approach is associated with the "critical turn" (''tournant critique'') taken by the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]], particularly around the 1960s.

In keeping with the ''Annales''' interest in the ''[[longue durée]]'' (long-term), the history of mentalities focuses on the mindsets of past cultural and social groups, and their gradual changes over time, as opposed to the history of particular events, or economic trends. The term can also be seen as an equivalent to, or a form of, [[cultural history]] or [[historical anthropology]]

== History ==

=== ''Annales'' ===
The history of mentalities, or ''histoire des mentalités'', is a term used to describe works of history aimed at describing and analyzing the ways in which people of a given time period thought about, interacted with, and classified the world around them. The history of mentalities has been used as a historical tool by several historians and scholars from various schools of history. Notably, the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]] helped to develop the history of mentalities and construct a methodology from which to operate. In establishing this methodology, they sought to limit their analysis to a particular place and a particular time.&lt;ref name=Duby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duby|first1=Georges|title=The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} This approach lends itself to the intensive study that characterizes microhistory, another field which adopted the history of mentalities as a tool of historical analysis.

The origin of the term history of mentalities lies in the writings of the ''Annales'' historians such as [[Georges Duby]] and [[Roger Chartier]]. In seeking to create works of total history, ''Annales'' historians tended not to simply rely on the political or event oriented history of past generations.&lt;ref name=Harsgor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harsgor|first1=Michael|title=Total History: The Annales School|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|date=January 1978|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Michael Harsgor points out in that the challenge of the ''Annales'' historians was not to create this deterministic history that appeared to rely heavily on teleological conclusions, such as the Marxist forms of history being written at the time. Rather, Harsgor writes that the ''Annales'' historians tasked themselves with the creation of social structures, "which means covering the skeleton of the basic economic analysis with the flesh of demographic, cultural, mental, and event psychoanalytical data."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|4}} It has also been said that ''Annales'' historians, in their attempts at the creation of total history, considered the history of mentalities a single aspect in the creation of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=Patrick|title=The History of Mentalities: The New Map of Cultural History|journal=History and Theory|date=October 1981|volume=20|issue=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they were attempting to reconstruct the world of whatever time period they were examining. In his works, such as ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'' and his work on William Marshal, Duby focused on the development of ideologies within the structures that permeated the various aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name=Duby/&gt;{{rp|9}}

=== Microhistory ===
This development in methodology would prove crucial for other historians who would use the history of mentalities to attempt to reconstruct the worldviews of individuals and extrapolate their findings to the population at large in the form of microhistories. These historians would largely concern themselves with social and cultural history in order to form their history of mentalities, narrowing their realm historical inquiry by not concerning themselves with the broad economic serialization that had become so important for the ''Annales'' historians.&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|2}} [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s book, ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'', is archetypical of the microhistories that emerged with the history of mentalities in mind. Ginzburg attempted to reconstruct peasant mentalities in sixteenth century Italy by examining the trial records of a single miller, Domenico Scandella, called [[Menocchio]], and trying to find currents or similarities in otherwise fragmentary and obscure evidence.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginzburg|first1=Carlo|title=The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

Similar techniques can be seen in [[Robert Darnton]]'s ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', which uses microhistory to establish the mentalities of groups at different social levels of French society. Darnton concerns himself greatly with the ways in which people viewed the world around them. He interprets the symbolic significance of journeymen printers massacring neighborhood cats as a display of frustration with the growing bourgeoisie class.&lt;ref name=Darnton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darnton|first1=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|date=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} Similarly, and in keeping with the tradition of the history of mentalities, Darnton devotes a chapter to an analysis of a bourgeoisie's description of his city, in an effort to determine how an individual in a given social situation would interpret and make sense of the world around them. Darnton uses this description to demonstrate that the ways in which events might be portrayed might be completely unsupported by the ways in which individuals of the time might have interpreted those events.&lt;ref name=Darnton/&gt;{{rp|116}}

== Criticism ==
Criticisms have emerged regarding the history of mentalities at all stages of its development. In particular, [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] were quick to criticize the ''Annales'' historians for "attempts to include the study of mentalities in a general synthesis, which can only lead to the publication of articles reflecting a basic reliance upon faith accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|7}} Carlo Ginzburg himself has criticized the methods of the history of mentalities for its "decidedly classless character."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg/&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

{{refimprove|date=March 2014}}

The '''hook''' is the nucleus of both a film and its [[screenplay]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It is what grabs the viewer's attention, preferably in the first 5–10 minutes, as a reader might expect to find a literary [[Narrative hook|hook]] in the first chapter of a novel.

During the [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] process, a screenwriter will use a hook to prove the "bankable" quality of their screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craftyscreenwriting.com/hook.html |title=The Hook |publisher=Crafty Screenwriting |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the importance of a good hook, many screenwriters write their hooks first. Conceivably, the life of a screenplay might evolve from hook to 1-page synopsis, to 4-page treatment, to full [[Film treatment|treatment]], to [[scriptment]], to screenplay.

One can briefly state a good hook in one or two sentences, introducing the protagonist, the conflict that drives the story, and what the [[protagonist]] will achieve with either triumph or defeat. The "hook" is the viewer's own question of whether the conflict can be resolved, so a screenwriter might want to test the hook by turning it into a question. For example, "Johnny must catch the murderer so that he can get the girl" might become "Will Johnny catch the murderer? Or will he lose the girl?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scriptfly.com/sceneanalysis/index.shtml |title=How to Write Your Screenplay's Hook |publisher=Scriptfly.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the screenwriter can use the hook as a tool when writing the screenplay.

'''Hypercolor''' was a line of clothing, mainly [[T-shirt]]s and [[shorts]], that changed [[colour]] with heat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch3J6mFxBKs Hypercolor TV commercial], youtube.com, last accessed: 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

They were manufactured by [[Generra]] Sportswear Company of [[Seattle]] and marketed in the [[United States]] as '''Generra Hypercolor''' or '''Generra Hypergrafix''' and elsewhere as '''Global Hypercolor'''. They contained a [[Thermochromism|thermochromic]] pigment made by [[Matsui Shikiso Chemical]] of [[Japan]], that changed between two colours &amp;ndash; one when cold, one when warm. The shirts were produced with several color change choices beginning in 1991.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/lifestyle/la-ig-hypercolor6-2008jul06,0,2927488.story |title=Hypercolor is hot again |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910424&amp;slug=1279344 |title=To Dye For – Hypercolor Clothes Heating Up Market For Maker Generra |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=24 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect could easily be permanently damaged, particularly when the clothing was washed in hotter than recommended water, [[ironing|ironed]], [[bleach]]ed, or [[Clothes dryer|tumble-dried]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

Generra Sportswear Co. had originally been founded as a men's sportswear [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] and [[importer]] in Seattle in 1980. The company was sold to [[Texas]]-based Farah Manufacturing Co. in 1984 and bought back by its founders in 1989. In 1986, the company added childrenswear and womenswear items to their portfolio.

==Principle==
Substances that can change color due to a change in temperature are called [[thermochromism|thermochromes]]. There are two types of thermochromes: [[liquid crystal]]s (used in [[mood ring]]s) and [[leuco dye]]s (used in Hypercolor T-shirts).

The color change of Hypercolor shirts is based on combination of two colors: the color of the dyed fabric, which remained constant, and the color of the thermochromic dye. Droplets of the thermochromic dye mixture are enclosed in transparent [[microcapsule]]s, a few micrometers in diameter, bound to the fibers of the fabric.

[[Image:Crystal_violet_lactone_reaction.svg|thumb|300px|Transformation between leuco and colored form of crystal violet lactone in response to varying acidity, which is caused by changing temperature]]

The thermochromic droplets are actually a mixture of several chemicals — [[crystal violet lactone]] (the color-changing dye itself), [[benzotriazole]] (a [[weak acid]]), and a [[quaternary ammonium salt]] of a [[fatty acid]] ([[myristylammonium oleate]]) dissolved in [[Dodecanol|1-dodecanol]] as solvent. Together, these lead to a reversible chemical reaction in response to temperature change that produces a change of color.

At low temperatures, the mixture is a solid. The weak acid forms a colored complex with the leuco dye by causing the [[lactone]] ring in the center of the dye molecule to open. At high temperatures, above 24–27&amp;nbsp;°C, the solvent melts and the ammonium salt [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]], allowing it to react with the weak acid. This reaction increases the [[pH]], which leads to closing of the lactone ring of the dye to convert it to its colorless (leuco) form.

Therefore, at the low temperature the color of the shirt is the combination of the color of the encapsulated colored dye with the color of the dyed fabric, while at higher temperatures the capsules become colorless and the color of the fabric prevails.

The '''Institute for Research in Art and Technology''' (IRAT, also known as New Arts Lab; Robert Street Arts Lab) was founded in London in 1969 by a group of artists and activists including painter/author Pamela Zoline, video Pioneer John Hopkins, painter Biddy Peppin, film enthusiast David Curtis, arts theorist [[John Lifton]] composer Hugh Davies. Its early focus was on video, film, theatre and new media but this was subsequently expanded to include experimental literature, drama, sculpture and multimedia all based on art/technology crossovers. 

In October 1969 the New Arts Lab opened on Robert Street, Camden Town, in a former chemical factory, with a screening of David Larcher’s Mare’s Tail (1969). This new arts centre, in addition to housing theatre, gallery and cinema space, also provided a base for the [[LFMC]] distribution office, screening and a newly equipped film workshop with a step printer and neg/reversal processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxonline.org.uk/history/1960-1969/drury_lane_arts_lab.html October 1969 - New Arts Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

This building housed artists workshops which included electronics, screen printing, the video co-op, the London Filmmakers Co-op distribution office and workshop TVX's video theatre.  I remember exhibitions by Stuart Brisley. Pam Zoline and J.G. Ballard's Crashed Cars. The book launch for William Burroughs "The Job" was held there. 
For its brief life, J G Ballard, Joe Tilson and [[William David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech]], were among IRAT's formal patrons.
When IRAT closed in March 1971, many of its organizers moved with the London Filmmakers Co-op to the Dairy, Prince of Wales Crescent.

The Directors in August 1970 included David Curtis, [[Hugh Davies (composer)|Hugh Davies]], [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John 'Hoppy' Hopkins]], [[John Lifton]], [[Pamela Zoline]] (USA) with [[Biddy Peppin]] as Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slashseconds.org/issues/001/001/articles/13_sford/index.php#16 J G Ballad's Crash exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intellectual''' is a person who engages in [[critical thinking]], [[research]], and [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] about society and proposes solutions for its [[normative]] problems, and gain [[Authority (sociology)|authority]] as public intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana dictionary of Modern Thought''. Third Ed. A. Bullock &amp; S. Trombley, Eds. (1999) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy and Kemp-Welch, Tony. "The Century of the Intellectual: From Dreyfus to Salman Rushdie", ''Intellectuals in Politics'', Routledge: New York (1997) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from the world of [[culture]], either as a creator or as a mediator, the intellectual participates in politics either to defend a concrete proposition or to denounce an injustice, usually by rejecting, producing or extending an [[ideology]], and by defending a system of [[value theory|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Ory]] and Jean-François Sirinelli, ''Les Intellectuels en France. De l'affaire Dreyfus à nos jours'' (''The Intellectuals in France: From the Dreyfus Affair to Our Days''), Paris: Armand Colin, 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Socially, intellectuals constitute the [[intelligentsia]], a [[Status group|status class]] organised either by [[ideology]] ([[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Fascism|fascist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[reactionary]], [[revolution]]ary, [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Communism|communist]] intellectuals, ''et al.''), or by nationality (American intellectuals, French intellectuals, Ibero–American intellectuals, ''et al.''). The contemporary intellectual class originated from the ''intelligentsiya'' of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] ({{circa|1860s}}–1870s), the [[Social stratification|social stratum]] of those possessing intellectual formation (schooling, education, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and who were Russian society's counterpart to the German ''Bildungsbürgertum'' and to the French ''bourgeoisie éclairée'', the [[Bourgeoisie|enlightened middle classes]] of those realms.&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983), pp. 169–71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In ''[[The Twilight of Atheism]]'' (2004, p. 53), the theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, theologically literate, anti-establishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of Germany in the 1830s ... three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment in a Church post". In the essay, "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", the cultural historian [[Robert Darnton]] said that the politically radical thinkers who had participated in the French Revolution (1789–1799), were not social outsiders, rather they were respectable, domesticated, and assimilated men. (pp. 1–40.) ''[[Grub Street in France|The Literary Underground of the Old Régime]]'', 1982.}}

In the late 19th century, amidst the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906), an identity crisis of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] nationalism for the [[French Third Republic]] (1870–1940), the [[reactionary]] anti–Dreyfusards ([[Maurice Barrès]], [[Ferdinand Brunetière]], ''et al.'') used the terms ''intellectual'' and ''the intellectuals'' to deride the liberal Dreyfusards ([[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Anatole France]], ''et al.'') as political dilettantes from the realms of French culture, art, and science, who had become involved in politics, by publicly advocating for the exoneration and liberation of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish French artillery captain falsely accused of betraying France to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Second Edition. (1958) pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the term ''Intellectual'' acquired positive connotations of [[Reputation|social prestige]], derived from possessing [[intellectualism|intellect]] and [[intelligence]], especially when the intellectual's activities exerted positive consequences in the [[public sphere]] and so increased the intellectual understanding of the public, by means of [[Morality|moral]] responsibility, [[altruism]], and [[solidarity]], without resorting to the [[psychological manipulation|manipulations]] of [[demagoguery]], [[paternalism]], and [[incivility]] (condescension).&lt;ref name="Williams, Raymond 1983 pp. 169"/&gt;{{efn|In the newspaper column, "Pilot Fish Among Sharks" (''El País'', 14 June 2014), the Spanish philosopher of ethics [[Fernando Savater|Fernando Fernández-Savater Martín]] explained the social function of the public intellectual with an anecdote about the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], at whose public conferences, in different cities, there always was present the same uneducated woman, who answered his query about her presence, by saying: "It's just that I like to listen to you, because you speak to us as if we were all intelligent."&lt;poem&gt;

Effectively so, that is precisely the specific function of the intellectual: To treat everyone else as if they, too, were intellectuals. That is to say, to not attempt to hypnotise them, to intimidate them, or to seduce them, but to awaken in them the mechanism of intelligence that weighs, evaluates, and comprehends. One must start from the Socratic premise that everyone in the world reveals himself, herself intelligent when treated as if intelligent. Is that social function compatible with the offices of politicians? Because, more often than not, they tend to govern themselves by the cynical principle that: "One must not treat the public as if they were imbeciles, nor forget that they are imbeciles", which was established by the novelist [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] (who, not in vain, began his career as an advertising man); it is plainly obvious that those are opposite approaches. What is bad, is that the first approach demands effort from the interlocutors—attention, reflection, and dubious sizings-up, while the second approach flatters the primitive emotions of enthusiasm or revenge, and converts critical thinking to satire or to swearing curses, and social problems into notorious scandal... .

Of course, the advocates of [[Atavism|atavistic]] formulas periodically return to the charge, because those emotional formulas are easily assumed out of ignorance (populism, as you already know, is democracy for the mentally lazy), and, as such, are more necessary than ever; thus, if there be no intellectuals in politics, at the least, there should be intellectual ethos in public and in social discourse. Nonetheless, the lesson of personal experience often is negative, and the honest intellectuals whom I know always have returned crestfallen [from politics], like the pioneer Plato returned from Syracuse... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2014/06/13/actualidad/1402681916_575638.html ''Peces piloto entre tiburones''], el País, 15 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}} Hence, for the educated person of a society, participating in the public sphere—the political affairs of the city-state—is a civic responsibility dating from the [[Classical antiquity|Græco–Latin Classical era]]:

{{Quotation|align=center|I am a human; I reckon nothing human to be foreign to me. (''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto''.) |''[[Heauton Timorumenos|The Self-Tormentor]]'' (163&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Terence]]&lt;ref&gt;Howatson, M.C. (Ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press. 1993. "Heau'ton timōrū'menos", 77, pp. 260–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/4/4-1053.html|title=LINGUIST List 4.1053: Jakobson quotation|author=|date=|website=linguistlist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The determining factor for ''a Thinker'' (historian, philosopher, scientist, writer, artist, ''et al.'') to be considered a public intellectual is the degree to which he or she is [[Logical consequence|implicated]] and [[Engaged theory|engaged]] with the vital reality of the contemporary world; that is to say, participation in the public affairs of society. Consequently, being designated as a public intellectual is determined by the degree of influence of the designator's [[motivation]]s, opinions, and options of action (social, political, ideological), and by affinity with the given thinker; therefore:{{efn|In the essay "[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]" (1946), Jean-Paul Sartre explains the philosophical concepts of [[Logical consequence|implication]] and [[Engaged theory|engagement]]. In ''Notas para una lectura'' (''Notes for a Lecture''), the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] philosopher [[:ca:Ramon Alcoberro i Pericay|Ramón Alcoberro i Pericay]] explains Sartre's opinion of not being engaged with one's times, and the consequent implications: ... once one comprehends his [Sartre's] idea of "Man as Situation", it is easier to understand the concepts of "responsibility" and "engagement". To become engaged in a concrete situation—"to become embarked", said [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]—is the consequence of presuming that one cannot live in pure, conceptual abstraction; everyone always is in a given "situation", and it corresponds to us to be responsible (to respond) to that situation; simply put, neutrality is not possible. In an editorial opinion in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in 1945, Sartre wrote, "I consider [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and the [[Goncourt brothers|Brothers Goncourt]] responsible for the [[Political repression|repression]] that followed the [[Paris Commune|Commune]], because they never wrote, even a line, to impede it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcoberro.info/planes/sartre3.htm|title=Sartre. El existencialismo es un humanismo|author=|date=|website=www.alcoberro.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[What Is literature?|What is Literature?]]'' (1947)}}

{{Quotation|align=center|The Intellectual is someone who meddles in what does not concern them. (''L'intellectuel est quelqu'un qui se mêle de ce qui ne le regarde pas''.)|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Cohen-Solal, ''Sartre'', Gallimard, 1989, pp. 588–89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Analogously, the application and the conceptual value of the terms ''Intellectual'' and ''the Intellectuals'' are socially negative when the practice of [[Intellectualism|intellectuality]] is exclusively in service to [[The Establishment]] who wield [[Power (social and political)|power]] in a society, as such:

{{Quotation|align=center|The Intellectuals are specialists in [[defamation]], they are basically [[political commissar]]s, they are the ideological administrators, the most threatened by [[Dissident|dissidence]].|[[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Peter R. and Schoeffel, Michael John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEzG68PlBl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Noam+Chomsky+Peter+R.+Mitchell+John+Schoeffel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mLlfTujyE-z34QTs-2E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intelectual%20disidencia&amp;f=false ''Chomsky''], Crítica, 2002, {{ISBN|8484323781}}, pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noam Chomsky's negative view of the Establishment Intellectual suggests the existence of another kind of intellectual one might call "the public intellectual," which is:

{{Quotation|... someone able to speak the truth, a ... courageous and angry individual for whom no worldly power is too big and imposing to be criticised and pointedly taken to task. The real or true intellectual is therefore always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society. He or she speaks to, as well as for, a public, necessarily in public, and is properly on the side of the dispossessed, the un-represented and the forgotten.|[[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]]&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Jeremy and Kemp–Welch, Anthony. (Eds.) ''Intellectuals in Politics: From the Dreyfus Affair to Salman Rushdie'', 1997. pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terms and endeavours==
The intellectual is a type of intelligent person, who is associated with [[reason]] and [[critical thinking]]. Many everyday roles require the application of intelligence to skills that may have a [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] component, for example, in the fields of medicine or the arts, but these do not necessarily involve the practitioner in the "world of ideas". The distinctive quality of the intellectual person is that the mental skills, which one demonstrates, are not simply intelligent, but even more, they focus on thinking about the abstract, philosophical and [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] aspects of human inquiry and the value of their thinking.{{Citation needed|reason=sounds elitist|date=October 2013}}

The intellectual and the [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] classes are related; the intellectual usually is not a teacher involved in the production of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], but has an academic background, and works in a profession, practices an art, or a science. The intellectual person is one who applies [[critical thinking]] and reason in either a professional or a personal capacity, and so has [[authority]] in the public sphere of their society; the term ''intellectual'' identifies three types of person, one who:

# is [[erudition|erudite]], and develops abstract ideas and theories
# a professional who produces [[cultural capital]], as in [[philosophy]], [[literary criticism]], [[sociology]], [[law]],  [[medicine]], [[science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Decisions|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Sowell|year=1980|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
# an [[artist]] who [[Writing|writes]], [[Musical composition|composes]], [[Painting|paints]], etc.

==="Man of letters"===
{{anchor|Man of Letters}}
The term "man of letters" derives from the French term ''[[Belles-lettres|belletrist]]'' or ''homme de lettres'' but is not synonymous with "an academic".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Reference Dictionary'' Second Edition, (1996) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cassel's French–English, English–French Dictionary'' (1962) p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A "man of letters" was a literate man ("able to read and write") as opposed to an [[illiterate]] man, in a time when [[literacy]] was a rare form of cultural capital. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ''Belletrists'' were the ''literati'', the French "citizens of the [[Republic of Letters]]", which evolved into the [[salon (gathering)|salon]], a social institution, usually run by a hostess, meant for the edification, education, and cultural refinement of the participants.

==Historical background==
In English, the term ''intellectual'' identifies a "literate thinker"; its earlier usage, as in the book title ''The Evolution of an Intellectual'' (1920), by [[John Middleton Murry]], denotes literary activity, rather than the activities of the public intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Collini p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century===
[[File:J’accuse.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|L'Aurore]]'' (13 January 1898) featured [[Émile Zola]]'s open letter, ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', asking the French President, [[Félix Faure]], to resolve the [[Dreyfus affair]].]]

====Britain====
In the late 19th century, when literacy was relatively common in European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], the "Man of Letters" (''littérateur'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Littérateur, n. |title=Discover the Story of English|edition=Second (1989)|date=June 2012|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109241 |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|orig-year=First published in New English Dictionary, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; denotation broadened to mean "specialized", a man who earned his living writing intellectually (not creatively) about literature: the [[essay]]ist, the [[journalist]], the [[critic]], et al. In the 20th century, such an approach was gradually superseded by the academic method, and the term "Man of Letters" became disused, replaced by the generic term "intellectual", describing the intellectual person. In late 19th century, the term ''intellectual'' became common usage to denote the defenders of the falsely accused artillery officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross (1969); see also Pierson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Continental Europe====
In early 19th century Britain, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] coined the term ''clerisy'', the intellectual class responsible for upholding and maintaining the national culture, the secular equivalent of the Anglican clergy. Likewise, in [[Tsar]]ist Russia, there arose the ''[[intelligentsia]]'' (1860s–70s), who were the [[Status group|status class]] of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workers. The theologian [[Alister McGrath]] said that "the emergence of a socially alienated, [[theology|theologically]] literate, antiestablishment lay intelligentsia is one of the more significant phenomena of the social history of [[Germany]] in the 1830s", and that "three or four theological graduates in ten might hope to find employment" in a church post.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twilight of Atheism'' (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, politically radical thinkers already had participated in the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799); [[Robert Darnton]] said that they were not societal outsiders, but "respectable, domesticated, and assimilated".&lt;ref&gt;From "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature", in ''The Literary Underground of the Old Regime'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thenceforth, in Europe, an intellectual class was socially important, especially to self-styled intellectuals, whose participation in society's arts, politics, journalism, and education—of either [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], or ethnic sentiment—constitute "vocation of the intellectual". Moreover, some intellectuals were anti-academic, despite universities (the Academy) being synonymous with [[intellectualism]].

In France, the [[Dreyfus affair]] marked the full emergence of the "intellectual in public life", especially [[Émile Zola]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Anatole France]] directly addressing the matter of French [[antisemitism]] to the public; thenceforward, "intellectual" became common, yet occasionally derogatory, usage; its French noun usage is attributed to [[Georges Clemenceau]] in 1898.

====Germany====
Habermas' ''Structural Transformation of Public Sphere'' (1963) made significant contribution to the notion of public intellectual by historically and conceptually delineating the idea of private and public.

===In the East===
{{expand section|date=October 2017|small=no}}
In [[Imperial China]], in the period from 206&amp;nbsp;BC until AD&amp;nbsp;1912, the intellectuals were the ''[[Scholar-official]]s'' ("Scholar-gentlemen"), who were civil servants appointed by the [[Emperor of China]] to perform the tasks of daily governance. Such civil servants earned academic degrees by means of [[imperial examination]], and also were skilled [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and knew [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:

{{quote|Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore, ed.|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22|isbn=9780824800758}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]] (1392–1910), the intellectuals were the ''literati'', who knew how to read and write, and had been designated, as the [[chungin]] (the "middle people"), in accordance with the Confucian system. Socially, they constituted the  [[petite bourgeoisie]], composed of scholar-bureaucrats (scholars, professionals, and technicians) who administered the dynastic rule of the Joseon dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The Korea Foundation|title=Koreana - Winter 2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkmOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73|date=February 12, 2016|pages=73–74|isbn=9791156041573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligentsia==
{{See also|Manufacturing Consent}}
Addressing their role as a social class, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] said that intellectuals are the moral conscience of their age; that their moral and ethical responsibilities are to observe the socio-political moment, and to freely speak to their society, in accordance with their consciences.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993:119&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sartre and [[Noam Chomsky]], public intellectuals usually are [[polymath]]s, knowledgeable of the [[International relations|international order]] of the world, the political and economic organization of contemporary society, the institutions and laws that regulate the lives of the layman citizen, the educational systems, and the private networks of [[Mass communication|mass communication media]] that [[Manufacturing Consent|control]] the broadcasting of information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999:xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas, intellectuals (political scientists and sociologists), liberals, and democratic socialists usually hold, advocate, and support the principles of democracy (liberty, equality, fraternity, human rights, social justice, social welfare, environmental conservation), and the improvement of socio-political relations in domestic and international politics, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] public-intellectuals usually defend the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]'' as the realisation of the "perfect ideals" of [[Platonism]], and present a static [[dominant ideology]], in which utopias are unattainable and politically destabilizing of society.

===Marxist perspective===
In [[Marxist philosophy]], the [[social class]] function of the intellectuals (the [[intelligentsia]]) is to be the source of progressive ideas for the transformation of society; to provide advice and counsel to the political leaders; to interpret the country's politics to the mass of the population (urban workers and peasants); and, as required, to provide leaders from within their own ranks.

The Italian Communist theoretician [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937) developed Karl Marx's conception of the intelligentsia to include political leadership in the public sphere. That, because "all knowledge is [[Existentialism|existentially]]-based", the intellectuals, who create and preserve knowledge, are "spokesmen for different social groups, and articulate particular social interests". That intellectuals occur in each social class and throughout the right wing, the centre, and the left wing of the political spectrum. That, as a social class, the "intellectuals view themselves as autonomous from the [[ruling class]]" of their society. That, in the course of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] meant to achieve political power, every social class requires a native intelligentsia who shape the [[ideology]] (world view) particular to the social class from which they originated. Therefore, the leadership of intellectuals is required for effecting and realizing social change, because:

{{Quotation|A human mass does not "distinguish" itself, does not become independent, in its own right, without, in the widest sense, organising itself; and there is no organisation without intellectuals, that is, without organisers and leaders, in other words, without ... a group of people "specialised" in [the] conceptual and philosophical elaboration of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997:210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the pamphlet ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1902), [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] (1870–1924) said that [[Leninism|vanguard-party revolution]] required the participation of the intellectuals to explain the complexities of [[socialism|socialist]] ideology to the uneducated [[proletariat]] and the urban industrial workers, in  order to integrate them to the revolution; because "the history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own efforts, is able to develop only [[Trade union|trade-union]] consciousness", and will settle for the limited, socio-economic gains so achieved. In Russia, as in [[Continental Europe]], Socialist theory was the product of the "educated representatives of the propertied classes", of "revolutionary socialist intellectuals", such as were Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Blanc, Paul. ''Revolution, Democracy, Socialism: Selected Writings of Lenin'' (Pluto Press, London: 2008) pp. 31, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formal codification of [[Leninism]], the Hungarian Marxist philosopher, [[György Lukács]] (1885–1971) identified the intelligentsia as the privileged social class who provide revolutionary leadership. By means of intelligible and accessible interpretation, the intellectuals explain to the workers and peasants the "Who?", the "How?", and the "Why?" of the social, economic, and political ''[[status quo]]''—the ideological totality of society—and its practical, revolutionary application to the transformation of their society.

Ed., ''Public Intellectuals'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the [[Academy|academic]] field or the [[profession]]al expertise, the public intellectual addresses and responds to the [[normative]] problems of society, and, as such, is expected to be an impartial critic who can "rise above the partial preoccupation of one's own profession—and engage with the global issues of [[truth]], judgment, and [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, 1987: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furedi, 2004: 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Representations of the Intellectual]]'' (1994), In summarizing a quote by [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]], Jennings and Kemp-Welch state that the "… true intellectual is, therefore, always an outsider, living in self-imposed exile, and on the margins of society".&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997: 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual usually is associated with an [[ideology]] or with a [[philosophy]]; e.g., the [[Third Way]] centrism of [[Anthony Giddens]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] of [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;McLennan, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech intellectual [[Václav Havel]] said that politics and intellectuals can be linked, but that moral responsibility for the intellectual's ideas, even when advocated by a politician, remains with the intellectual. Therefore, it is best to avoid [[utopia]]n intellectuals who offer 'universal insights' to resolve the problems of [[political economy]] with [[Public policy|public policies]] that might harm and that have harmed civil society; that intellectuals be mindful of the social and cultural ties created with their words, insights, and ideas; and should be heard as social critics of [[politics]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997: 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social background===
The American academic [[Peter H. Smith]] describes the intellectuals of Latin America as people from an identifiable social class, who have been conditioned by that common experience, and thus are inclined to share a set of [[Value (ethics)|common assumptions]] (values and ethics); that ninety-four per cent of intellectuals come either from the [[middle class]] or from the [[upper class]], and that only six per cent come from the [[working class]]. In ''The Intellectual'' (2005), philosopher [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steven Fuller]] said that, because [[cultural capital]] confers [[power (social and political)|power]] and social status, as a status group, they must be autonomous in order to be credible as intellectuals:

{{Quotation|It is relatively easy to demonstrate autonomy, if you come from a wealthy or [an] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] background. You simply need to disown your [[social status|status]] and champion the poor and [the] downtrodden ... autonomy is much harder to demonstrate if you come from a poor or [[Proletariat|proletarian]] background ... [thus] calls to join the wealthy in common cause appear to betray one's class origins.|source=&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 2005: pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The political importance and effective consequence of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus affair]] (1894–1906) derived from his being a leading French thinker; thus, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'accuse]]'' (I Accuse), his open letter to the French government and the nation proved critical to achieving the exoneration of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the false charges of treason, which were facilitated by institutional [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], among other ideological defects of the French Establishment.

===Academic background===
In journalism, the term ''intellectual'' usually connotes "a university academic" of the [[humanities]]—especially a [[philosophy|philosopher]]—who addresses important social and political matters of the day. Hence, such an academic functions as a public intellectual who explains the theoretic bases of said problems and communicates possible answers to the policy makers and executive leaders of society. The sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] said that "Intellectuals are not defined according to the jobs they do, but [by] the manner in which they act, the way they see themselves, and the [social and political] values that they uphold.&lt;ref&gt;Furedi (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Public intellectuals usually arise from the educated élite of a society; although the North American usage of the term "intellectual" includes the university academics.&lt;ref&gt;McKee (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between "intellectual" and "academic" is participation in the realm of public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public policy role===
In the matters of [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], the public intellectual connects scholarly research to the practical matters of solving societal problems. The British sociologist [[Michael Burawoy]], an exponent of [[public sociology]], said that professional sociology has failed, by giving insufficient attention to resolving social problems, and that a dialogue between the academic and the layman would bridge the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gattone 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An example is how [[Chile]]an intellectuals worked to reestablish [[democracy]] within the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] governments of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]], the Pinochet régime allowed professional opportunities for some liberal and left-wing social scientists to work as politicians and as consultants in effort to realize the theoretical economics of the [[Chicago Boys]], but their access to [[Power (social and political)|power]] was contingent upon political [[pragmatism]], abandoning the political neutrality of the academic intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sociological Imagination]]'' (1959), [[C. Wright Mills]] said that academics had become ill-equipped for participating in public discourse, and that journalists usually are "more politically alert and knowledgeable than sociologists, economists, and especially ... political scientists".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, 1959: 99.&lt;/ref&gt; That, because the universities of the U.S. are bureaucratic, private businesses, they "do not teach [[Critical thinking|critical reasoning]] to the student", who then does not "how to gauge what is going on in the general struggle for power in modern society".&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Likewise, [[Richard Rorty]] criticized the participation of intellectuals in public discourse as an example of the "civic irresponsibility of [[Intellectualism|intellect]], especially academic intellect".&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169625-1/public-intellectuals ''Booknotes'' interview with Posner on ''Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline'', June 2, 2002], [[C-SPAN]]}}
The American legal scholar [[Richard Posner]] said that the participation of academic public intellectuals in the public life of society is characterized by logically untidy and politically biased statements of the kind that would be unacceptable to academia. That there are few ideologically and politically independent public intellectuals, and disapproves that public intellectuals limit themselves to practical matters of public policy, and not with [[Value (ethics)|values]] or [[public philosophy]], or public [[ethics]], or [[public theology]], not with matters of moral and spiritual outrage.

==Criticism==
[[Image:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The economist [[Milton Friedman]] identified the intelligentsia and the business class as interfering with the economic functions of a society.]]
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Socrates]] proposed for philosophers a private monopoly of knowledge separate from the public sphere. (the Louvre)]]

[[image:Bertrand Russell transparent bg.png|thumb|upright|As an intellectual, [[Bertrand Russell]] was a pacifist who advised Britain against re-arming for [[World War I]].]]

In "An Interview with Milton Friedman" (1974), the American [[libertarian]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] said that businessmen and the intellectuals are enemies of capitalism; the intellectuals, because most believed in socialism, while the businessman expected economic privileges:

{{Quotation|The two, chief enemies of the free society or [[free enterprise]] are intellectuals, on the one hand, and businessmen, on the other, for opposite reasons. Every intellectual believes in freedom for himself, but he's opposed to freedom for others. ... He thinks ... [that] there ought to be a central planning board that will establish social priorities. ... The businessmen are just the opposite—every businessman is in favor of freedom for everybody else, but, when it comes to himself that's a different question. He's always "the special case". He ought to get special privileges from the government, a [[tariff]], this, that, and the other thing. ...&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reason Magazine]]'', "[http://reason.com/archives/1974/12/01/an-interview-with-milton-fried An Interview with Milton Friedman]". December 1974&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "The Intellectuals and Socialism" (1949), the British libertarian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], said that "journalists, teachers, ministers, lecturers, publicists, radio commentators, writers of fiction, cartoonists, and artists", are the intellectual social class whose function is to communicate the complex and specialized knowledge of the [[scientist]] to the general public. That, in the twentieth century, the intellectuals were attracted to socialism and to [[social democracy]], because the socialists offered "broad visions; the spacious comprehension of the social order, as a whole, which a [[Planned economy|planned system]] promises" and that such broad-vision philosophies "succeeded in inspiring the imagination of the intellectuals" to change and improve their societies.&lt;ref&gt;"The Intellectuals and Socialism", ''The University of Chicago Law Review'' (Spring 1949),&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hayek, intellectuals disproportionately support socialism for [[idealistic]] and [[utopia]]n reasons that cannot be realized in practical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/etexts/hayekintellectuals.pdf|title=Papers of Interest|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the article "Why Socialism?" (1949), [[Albert Einstein]] said that [[Political economy|the economy]] of the world is not private property because it is a "planetary community of production and consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php |title=Why Socialism? [1949] |author=Albert Einstein |work=Monthly Review |volume=61 |issue=1 |date=May 2009 |origyear=May 1949|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S. society, the intellectual status class are [[demographic]]ally characterized as people who hold [[Liberalism|liberal]]-to-[[leftist]] political perspectives about [[Guns versus butter model|guns-or-butter]] [[fiscal policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1549 |title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media: Section 4: Scientists, Politics and Religion - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind" (1987), the journalist and [[popular historian]] [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] said:
{{Quotation|It is not the formulation of ideas, however misguided, but the desire to impose them on others that is the deadly sin of the intellectuals. That is why they so incline, by temperament, to [[Left-wing politics|the Left]]. For capitalism merely occurs; if no-one does anything to stop it. It is [[socialism]] that has to be constructed, and, as a rule, forcibly imposed, thus providing a far bigger role for intellectuals in its genesis. The [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual habitually entertains [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty|Walter Mitty]] visions of exercising power.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul. "The Heartless Lovers of Humankind", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The public- and private-knowledge dichotomy originated in [[Ancient Greece]], from [[Socrates]]'s rejection of the [[Sophist]] concept that the pursuit of knowledge ([[truth]]) is a "public market of ideas", open to all men of the city, not only to philosophers. In contradiction to the Sophist's public market of knowledge, Socrates proposed a knowledge monopoly for and by the philosophers; thus, "those who sought a more penetrating and rigorous intellectual life rejected, and withdrew from, the general culture of the city, in order to embrace a new model of professionalism"; the private market of ideas.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;

In the 19th century, addressing the societal place, roles, and functions of intellectuals in American society, the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] theologian [[Edwards Amasa Park]] said, "We do wrong to our own minds, when we carry out scientific difficulties down to the arena of popular dissension".&lt;ref name=Bender12&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 12.&lt;/ref&gt; That for the stability of society (social, economic, political) it is necessary "to separate the serious, [[Social engineering (political science)|technical role]] of professionals from their responsibility [for] supplying [[Public policy|usable philosophies]] for the general public"; thus operated Socrate's cultural dichotomy of public-knowledge and private-knowledge, of "civic culture" and "professional culture", the social constructs that describe and establish the [[Intellectualism|intellectual sphere of life]] as separate and apart from the civic sphere of life.&lt;ref name=Bender12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bender, T, 1993: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligentsia===
The American historian [[Norman Stone]] said that the intellectual [[social class]] misunderstand the reality of society and so are doomed to the errors of [[logical fallacy]], ideological stupidity, and poor planning hampered by ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings and Kemp Welch, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Margaret Thatcher]] said that the anti-monarchical [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) was "a [[utopia]]n attempt to overthrow a traditional order ... in the name of [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|abstract ideas]], formulated by vain intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, 1993:753.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Prime Minister, Thatcher asked Britain's academics to help her government resolve the social problems of British society—whilst she retained the [[populist]] opinion of "The Intellectual" as being a man of un-British character, a [[Intellectualism|thinker]], not a doer; Thatcher's anti-intellectualist perspective was shared by the mass media, especially  ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspapers, whose reportage documented a "lack of intellectuals" in Britain.&lt;ref name="Jennings and Kemp-Welch, 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism?" (1998), [[libertarian]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] of the [[Cato Institute]] argued that intellectuals become embittered [[leftist]]s because their academic skills, much rewarded at school and at university, are under-valued and under-paid in the capitalist [[market economy]]; so, the intellectuals turned against capitalism—despite enjoying a more economically and financially comfortable life in a capitalist society than they might enjoy in either a [[socialist]] or a [[communist society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-20n1-1.html |title=Why do intellectuals oppose capitalism? |first=Robert |last=Nozick |journal=Cato Policy Report |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=January–February 1998 |pages=1, 9–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[post-Communist]] Europe, the social attitude perception of the intelligentsia became [[anti-intellectual]]; in the [[Netherlands]], the word "intellectual" negatively connotes an overeducated person of "unrealistic visions of the World". In [[Hungary]], the intellectual is perceived as an "egghead", a person who is "too-clever" for the good of society. In the [[Czech Republic]], the intellectual is a cerebral person, aloof from reality. Such derogatory connotations of "intellectual" are not definitive, because, in the "case of English usage, positive, neutral, and pejorative uses can easily coexist"; the example is [[Václav Havel]] who, "to many outside observers, [became] a favoured instance of The Intellectual as National Icon" in the early history of the post-Communist Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Collini, 2006: 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''[[Intellectuals and Society]]'' (2010), the economist [[Thomas Sowell]] said that, lacking [[disincentive]]s in professional life, the intellectual (producer of knowledge, not material goods) tends to speak outside his or her area of expertise, and expects social and professional benefits from the [[halo effect]], derived from possessing professional expertise. That, in relation to other professions, the public intellectual is socially detached from the negative and [[unintended consequences]] of [[public policy]] derived from his or her ideas. As such, the philosopher and mathematician [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) advised the British government against national rearmament in the years before [[World War I]] (1914–1918), while the [[German Empire]] prepared for war. Yet, the post-war intellectual reputation of Bertrand Russell remained almost immaculate and his opinions respected by the general public because of the halo effect.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2010). ''Intellectuals and Society'', Basic Books {{ISBN|0-465-01948-X}}, pp. 218–276 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intercultural competence''' is a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioural skills that lead to effective and appropriate
[[communication]]  with people of other [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal.

''Health &amp; Social Care In The Community'', ''24''(6), e117-e130. doi:10.1111/hsc.12293&lt;/ref&gt; Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lustig, M. W., &amp; Koester, J. (2003). ''Intercultural competence: Interpersonal communication across cultures'' (4th ed.). Boston : Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Basics==
It's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liu, S. (2014) that allow a person understand another person from another culture. Becoming intercultural: exposure to foreign cultures and intercultural competence through [[travel]] and [[tourism]]. ''China Media Research'', ''10''(3), 7+. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m. (2010). Inclusive Cultural Empathy for Successful Global Leadership. ''American Psychologist'', ''65''(8), 841-854. doi:10.1037/a0020916&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015). When an Intercultural Business Negotiation Fails: Comparing the Emotions and Behavioural Tendencies of Individualistic and Collectivistic Negotiators. ''Group Decision &amp; Negotiation'', ''24''(3), 537-561. doi:10.1007/s10726-014-9420-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maali, B. M., &amp; Al-Attar, A. (2017).

** Decisions are based on the benefits of the group rather than the individual;
** Strong loyalty to the group as the main social unit;
** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004). Studying abroad: the role of college students' goals on the development of cross-cultural skills and global understanding. ''College Student Journal'', 38(3). Retrieved July 9, 2007, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lessard-Clouston |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Towards an understanding of culture in L2/FL education |journal=Ronko: K.G. studies in English |volume=25 |pages=131–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lievens |first=F. |last2=Harris |first2=M. |last3=Van Keer |first3=E. |last4=Bisqueret |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Predicting cross-cultural training performance: The validity of personality, cognitive ability, and dimensions measured by an assessment center and a behavior description interview |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=476–489 |pmid=12814296 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B.

Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palomba, A. &amp; Banta, T. (1999). ''Assessment essentials.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012). ''The ICCA™ Facilitator's Manual'' London: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is The ICCA?|url=http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx|work=Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal|publisher=GloBus Research Ltd.|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

[[File:Visitbamiyan.JPG|thumb|VisitBamiyan was created in August 2009 to market [[Bamiyan]] to the rest of the world.]]

'''International tourism advertising''' is [[tourism]]-related marketing on the part of a private or public entity directed towards audiences abroad, and might target potential travelers and non-travelers alike.  Wholly private firms such as travel agencies, hotel chains, cruise agencies, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] often run their own advertising campaigns to market their existence, mission, or services and/or goods offered to the consumer, and these advertisements seldom carry intentional political messages.

On the other hand, advertising distributed by governments themselves, such as through tourism ministries or government-owned private sector enterprises, is sometimes intended to convey more than simply the value of the product, service, or experience; governments can use tourism ads as a channel for communicating directly to the public of other countries because tourism is a common and internationally encouraged industry and the advertising of it is subject to minimal content regulation.

As the global travel market continues to expand with yearly increasing flights among international destinations, advertising efforts on the part of the major actors in this market are also increasing. [[Advertising]] campaigns to promote travel to destinations abroad are particularly prevalent in western countries where the general public's expenditures on tourism tend to be consistently high, even in light of the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]]. 

Many advertisers, which include both private entities and foreign governments themselves, share the intended goal of increasing their own revenue by popularizing their service (e.g., airline or hotel chain) or destination to boost receipts from travelers; however, some travel campaigns have additional or alternative purposes, such as promoting good public sentiments or improving existing ones towards them among the target audience.  Sometimes, states may use the branding of a product or service, itself, as a means of conveying a specific message without explicitly stating the message; this tactic is often used to soften the implied message itself, thus allowing the brander to sidestep or minimize controversy and/or opposition.

==Types==
Tourism advertising can take many forms, utilize a wide array of advertising tactics, and be driven by a scope of private or public intents. ''Destination advertising'' is designed to make a location itself seem more appealing, while ''travel services advertising'' seeks to gain an audience's buy-in for the tourism-related service or product. Below are some instances of international tourism advertising overlapping with states' political, economic, and/or social interests.

===Destination advertising===
A great degree of ads promoting foreign countries are produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often serve as [[Public diplomacy|vehicles for political statements and/or depictions]] of the destination country's desired foreign public perception(s).  Following are only a few of the many examples of government-produced tourism destination advertising that also serve political or social functions.

====Bahamas====
The Bahamas are commonly considered to be a focal point of leisure and recreational travel in the Caribbean and the island nation advertises itself as such.  Television ads and website produced by the government of the Bahamas specifically foster the image of the islands providing a care-free, exciting, culturally rich, and even romantic experience for travelers; a recent slogan for the marketing campaign was "It's better in the Bahamas" to reinforce the contrast between the desired perception as a low-stress getaway and the hectic nature of whatever living environment tourists would be leaving behind.  The Bahamas have, however, actually traditionally seen high violent crime rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2010/11/pm-addresses-issue-of-rising-violent-crime-4224.html|title=PM Addresses Issue Of Rising Violent Crime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the tourism marketing attempts to focus the audience's attention on the azure water and beaches and draw it away from any negative elements of life there.  [[Perception management|Managing perceptions]] is a common part of advertising of many consumer products and services, focusing the audience's mind solely on the desirable aspects of whatever is being sold and away from any possible drawbacks or consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahamas.com/ |title=Official tourism website of the Bahamas |publisher=Bahamas.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The common impression of [[India]] in the West has long been either negative—including perceptions of widespread poverty, lack of sophisticated hygiene, and violent ethnic and religious clashes—or ambivalent, so the Indian government's Ministry of Tourism began a marketing campaign, "Incredible !ndia," to emphasize the country's rich culture, historic sites, tourist attractions, and general sense of excitement and dynamism to western audiences.  Tourism is an extremely lucrative and growing global industry so it is no surprise that India, a developing nation, is striving to capitalize on that market to boost its economy.  In addition, India is also looking to strengthen its international security and diplomatic ties while broadening and deepening its trade relationships, especially with the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/us-india.asp |title=U.S.-India Trade Relations, U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service, 4 August 2010 |publisher=Fas.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is in India's interest to promote a positive light for itself among the American and western voting populations in order to garner future international support and aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleindia.org/index.html |title=Indian Ministry of Tourism's official advertising website |publisher=Incredibleindia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kazakhstan====
After the 2006 release of the [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] comedy ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]'', which depicts a politically incorrect and socially oblivious fictional Kazakhi reporter who travels throughout the United States interviewing and meeting Americans from various walks of life, the government of [[Kazakhstan]] was highly offended by the depiction of its less than two-decade-old country and [[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan#Criticism by Kazakhstan|criticized the film]] and its creator as being defamatory and slanderous.  The issue of preserving Kazakhstan's public image in light of the movie was of such high importance that Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] had it listed as a main issue when he traveled to the U.S. in September 2006 to meet with then-President [[George W. Bush]].  Coupled with Nazarbeyev's visit, according to Kazakhstan embassy spokesman Roman Vassilenko, the Kazakh government staged a large-scale public relations "blitz," including "running four-page ads in The New York Times and U.S. News and World Report and commercials on CNN and the local ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6276973 |title=Kazakhstan Embassy Responds to Borat, 16 October 2006 |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as launching TV ads to promote tourism to Kazakhstan.  These travel ads specifically featured cultural and historical features of the country as well as views of its developed infrastructure, specifically to counter the type of impression given by the Borat character to the West that Kazakhstan is socially and physically underdeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kazakhembus.com/index.php?page=travel-tourism |title=Kazakh Embassy's official travel &amp; tourism website |publisher=Kazakhembus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
Recently in 2010 the Tourism Board of [[Mexico]], a public office that aggregates the resources and interests of the federal, state, and municipal governments, launched a tourism advertising campaign in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]—Mexico's two [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)]] partners—geared towards renovating common public political and social perceptions of Mexico, including impressions of poverty, government and law enforcement corruption, petty and organized crime and drug trading, and illegal immigration into the U.S.; the new campaign's purpose is expressly demonstrated by its marketing slogan, "Mexico, the place you thought you knew."  The print and television ads feature views of Mexico's beaches, natural wonders, cultural festivities, and historical artifacts like Mayan pyramids and Spanish churches in order to provide a counterbalance to the less preferable popular preconceptions.  The Tourism Board's stated goal of the advertising surge is to "generat[e] more than three [positive] impressions per person" among the North American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Otilia Otlacan |url=http://www.adoperationsonline.com/2010/08/18/mexico-tourism-board-launches-advertising-campaign-in-north-america/ |title=Mexico Tourism Board Launches Advertising Campaign in North America, 18 August 2010 |publisher=Adoperationsonline.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eventual goal is likely to increase tourism revenue for the country, but, for now, the Tourism Board is focusing on [[Public diplomacy|managing perceptions]] among the general populations of Mexico's two major neighboring trade partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110720100348/http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Home?show=regions%2F|deadurl=yes|title=::- VISIT MEXICO -:: Home|date=20 July 2011|archivedate=20 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destination slogans====

Many countries use slogans in their international tourism advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familybreakfinder.co.uk/holidays/map-every-countrys-tourism-slogan/|title=Map Shows Every Country's Tourism Slogan|website=www.familybreakfinder.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destination slogans aim to promote a positive identity for the country. Academic studies of these slogans have identified several common themes such as the physical beauty of the location or the positive experiences travellers can expect to have there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/100085/GRADU-1479373517.pdf?sequence=1|title="Be Our Guest" – A Linguistic Study of Destination Slogans|last=Häkkinen|first=Minttu-Maari|date=October 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel services advertising===

Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which also advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments, such as the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).

====China Airways and Air China====
[[China Airlines]] is the official flag carrier airline of [[Taiwan]].  The Taiwanese government refers to its state as the Republic of China and considers itself to be the legitimate, non-Communist leadership-in-exile of all of China since the Communist overthrow in the mid-1950s.  The name of the airline carries the message of the long-lasting and ongoing cultural and [[Cross-Strait relations|political conflict]] between Communist "mainland" [[People's Republic of China|China (PRC)]] and Taiwan, that the Republic of China is the "true" China and that the state commonly referred to as "China" is illegitimate and usurped control of the country from the rightful leadership.  Similarly, the PRC counters this message by having named one of its largest international carriers "[[Air China]]" to reinforce the PRC's claim to be the legitimate of the "two Chinas."  The implicit conflict between the two states is likely lost on the majority of the general public outside the [[East Asia|immediate region]], such as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], but the strategic use of using advertising and targeting the international community through tourism is apparent on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |title=Official global website of China Airlines |language=zh |publisher=China-airlines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051752/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airchina.com/ |title=Official global website of Air China |publisher=Airchina.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emirates====
Through advertising for the Emirates airline, one of the major themes that Dubai promotes is its evolving status as a geographic and economic player in the Middle East.  Emirates advertising describes Dubai as "the perfect hub for an expanding global network" and illustrates this claim in the airline's "Centre of the World" television ad.  On the other hand, Dubai subtly promotes an official stance of multinationalism and a stated intent to cater to the comfort of travelers from abroad in the Emirates' "Multinational Cabin Crew" television ad.  These positions, among others, are portrayed via visually and audibly appealing commercials which are designed to relate to the target audience(s) and make the ads' messages maximally amenable to global viewers.  Emirates additionally adds to its effort to appeal to the West through its sponsorship of the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]], including constructing the team's new venue, [[Emirates Stadium]], which opened in July 2006 and prominently displays the Emirates branding on the exterior; in this way, any depictions of the stadium will result in de facto advertising and reinforce the public recognition of the Emirates company as one that is associated with western sports and culture. In May 2013 three Arsenal players, Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson took an A380 flight simulator challenge. Swapping their usual airline passenger seats and stepping into the cockpit, the players attempted to land an A380 in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaichronicle.com/2013/05/28/arsenals-trio-attempts-to-land-an-a380-in-dubai/|title=Arsenal's trio attempts to land an A380 in Dubai|author=Editor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emirates, along with the aviation services company [[Dnata]], is owned by the parent company [[The Emirates Group]] which, in turn, is wholly owned by the Government of Dubai.  The chairman and CEO of The Emirates Group, HH Sheikh [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], is the younger brother of the former ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], and uncle of the current ruler, HH Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].  In 1985, Sheikh Ahmed was appointed President of the Dubai Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), the governing body for airline regulation and airport control and operation.  The DCA was restructured and expanded in 2007, thus creating the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) which has since been the airline regulatory authority in the Emirate and the Dubai Airports company which owns and operates Dubai’s airports, Dubai International and the currently under-construction Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theemiratesgroup.com/english/our-company/leadership/hh-sheikh-ahmed-bin-saeed-al-maktoum.aspx |title=HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, The Emirates Group (Leadership profiles), 2010 |publisher=Theemiratesgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dubai International]] (IATA: DXB) is a primary international hub in the Middle East, offering flights to every continent except Antarctica.  As of November 2010, DXB is the 6th busiest airport in the world for cargo traffic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-219-227_666_2__ |title=Year to date Cargo Traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 14th highest passenger throughput of all international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |title=Year to date passenger traffic, Airports Council International, 11 November 2010 |publisher=Airports.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111152406/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |archivedate=11 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Ahmed currently simultaneously holds the positions of Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline &amp; Group, which includes the Emirates airline and Dnata air services company, Chairman of the Dubai Airports company, and President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority.&lt;ref name="theemiratesgroup.com"/&gt;  Because Dubai's government leadership is directly involved and intertwined with private-sector enterprises, including the Emirates airline and many other facets of the tourism industry, the government there necessarily has a vested interest in the public perception of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates.com |title=Official global website of Emirates |publisher=Emirates.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

In Congo folklore, the '''''jba fofi''''' or '''''j'ba fofi''''' (Baka: "giant spider"), also known as the '''Congolese giant spider''', is a creature said to exist in the [[Congo Basin|Congo]], possibly representing a new species of [[arachnid]]. Popular interest in the creature was sparked by the program [[Monsterquest]] in 2008. Although best known for sightings within Africa, purported giant spiders have been reported worldwide.

==Name==
The creature is most famously known as the ''jba fofi'', the name that [[Baka people (Congo and South Sudan)|Baka]] tribespeople in the Congo have called the giant arachnids that reportedly reside by their dwellings. The name means "great spider" in their language.&lt;ref name="Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[William J. Gibbons]] | title=Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin |pages=158–159| publisher=Coachwhip Publications| year=2010 | isbn=1-61646-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although giant spider sightings have taken place since the late 19th century,{{cn|date=July 2018}} the recent surge in interest began with the episode on Monsterquest followed by the publication of William Gibbon's book. The researcher was familiar with the sighting by Reginald Lloyd of an enormous spider in Zimbabwe in 1938,{{cn|date=July 2018}} and while speaking to Baka natives about the [[mokele-mbembe]] he asked them if they had ever seen such a creature. They were familiar with a similar beast that they called the ''jba fofi'', and gave a like description.

==Description and habitat==
The [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] said that the ''jba fofi'' of the Congo would spin a web between two trees which they utilized to capture birds, duiker, and other small game animals. Their eggs were the size of peanuts, and juveniles were yellowish with purple abdomens. When they matured they would turn brown, and were four to five feet in length. The Baka said that they were strong enough to overpower humans, and that they would kill a ''jba fofi'' if it made its nest too close to the village. The spiders are described by [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] natives as weaving lairs made of leaves and spinning a circular web between two trees. The Baka told Gibbons that these spiders are now rare due to dwindling habitat. Descriptions of giant spider sightings elsewhere bear a similar resemblance, with some variance in color.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Sightings==

===1890s: Uganda===
Missionary Arthur Simes from England was on an expedition to a village near Lake Nyasa when several of his porters became ensnared by a huge web that had been strung up in the forest. They were then attacked by several large spiders that had a leg span of four feet and were bitten.&lt;ref&gt;https://thecuriousfortean.com/2017/10/23/the-jba-fofi-giant-spider-of-the-congo/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thepresencebook.com/jba-fofi/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938: DR Congo===
Reginald and Margurite Lloyd were driving a Ford truck through a trail when they reportedly spotted a spider as large as a large jungle cat. It resembled a light brown tarantula, but had an estimated leg-span of 5 feet. After briefly pausing in front of their vehicle it scurried off into the jungle. Liam Christopher and his brother Jenner Edwards and their daughters Sally and Maurgurite Lloyd, would later relate this story in the 1990s to William Gibbons.&lt;ref name="Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[William J. Gibbons]] | title=Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin |pages=158–159| publisher=Coachwhip Publications| year=2010 | isbn=1-61646-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.history.com/shows/monsterquest/season-2/episode-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942: Papua, New Guinea===
During the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]], an Australian soldier at the Kokoda Trail said that he encountered a puppy-sized spider inhabiting a 30 foot sized web. It was described as being black with a bulky body, as well as hairy like a tarantula.&lt;ref name="Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology - Volume 1"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[ George M. Eberhart]] | title=Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology - Volume 1 |pages=204| publisher=cfz| year=2013 | isbn=978-1909488076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011: Amazon===
British cinematographer [[Richard Terry (cinematographer)|Richard Terry]] travelled to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] to investigate reports of giant spiders in the June 13th episode of ''[[Man v. Monster]]''. At a remote village, he was informed that giant spiders lived in holes deep within the jungle. These spiders measured roughly four feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="Listverse.com's Epic Book of Mind-Boggling Lists: Unbelievable Facts and Astounding Trivia on Movies, Music, Crime, Celebrities, History, and More"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[Jamie Frater]] | title=Listverse.com's Epic Book of Mind-Boggling Lists: Unbelievable Facts and Astounding Trivia on Movies, Music, Crime, Celebrities, History, and More |pages=138| publisher=Ulysses Press| year=2014 | isbn=9781612432977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoaxes==
In 2015 the photo of a purported 6-foot wide "giant Hawaiian cane spider" was published on [[Facebook]]. The image was later proven to be a digital forgery. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-giant-hawaiian-cane-spider/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
There is speculation that sightings - either the ''jba fofi'' or giant spiders elsewhere are actually misidentifications of [[coconut crabs]], which is the largest terrestrial crab and can grow to over 3 feet. An argument against the existence of the ''jba fofi'' is the fact that spiders have a simple respiratory system that limits the size that they can achieve, with the [[Goliath birdeater]] representing the highest end of the growth spectrum for an arachnid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scienceworld.ca/why-arent-spiders-bigger&lt;/ref&gt; Another contrary viewpoint is that a spider's exoskeleton could not support the weight generated by a creature the size of the ''jba fofi''.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.journal-news.net/life/home-and-garden/2013/10/stories-about-giant-spiders-have-no-legs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Korean nationalist historiography}}

===Early usage and origins===
Contrary to popular belief in the Koreas, the contemporary Korean ideology of a "pure Korean race" began only in the early 20th century when the Japanese annexed Korea&lt;ref name=myers /&gt; and launched a campaign to persuade them that they were of the same pure racial stock as the Japanese themselves.&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt;

In the colonial period, the Imperial Japanese's assimilation policy claimed that Koreans and Japanese were of common origin but the former always subordinate. The pure blood theory was used to justify colonialist policies to replace Korean cultural traditions with Japanese ones in order to supposedly get rid of all distinctions and achieve equality between Koreans and inlanders.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Ethnic pride source of prejudice, discrimination] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053258/http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802 |date=2011-07-20 }}, Gi-Wook Shin, Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The policy included changing Korean names into Japanese, exclusive use of Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese ethical system, and Shinto worship.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt; [[Brian Reynolds Myers]], a professor at [[Dongseo University]], argues that seeing the failure of the pure [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] policy, Japanese imperial ideologues changed their policy into creating a Korean ethnic-patriotism on par with the Japanese one. They encouraged Koreans to take pride in their Koreanness, in their history, heritage, culture and "dialect" as a brother nation going back to a common ancestry with the Japanese. Thus, Korean race nationalism can be seen as a deliberate and direct creation of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].&lt;ref name="myers"/&gt;{{page number needed|date=December 2016}}

===Independence===
[[File:Baitou Mountain Tianchi.jpg|thumb|right|Heaven Lake of [[Baekdu Mountain]] where [[Hwanung]], [[Dangun]]'s father, is said to have descended from heaven, constitutes a foundation for the legend of blood purity in Korean]]

[[Shin Chaeho]] (1880–1936), the founder of the nationalistic historiography of modern Korea and a [[Korean independence movement]] activist, published his influential book of reconstructed history ''[[Joseon Sanggosa]]'' (''The Early History of Joseon'') in 1924–25, proclaiming that Koreans are descendants of [[Dangun]], the legendary ancestor of Korean people, who merged with Buyo of [[Manchuria]] to form the [[Goguryeo]] people.&lt;ref name=gries&gt;The Koguryo Controversy,
National Identity, and Sino-Korean Relations Today [http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf], Peter Hays Gries, Institute for US-China Issues, The University of Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing from the Japanese theory of nation, Shin Chaeho located the martial roots of the Korean in Goguryeo, which he depicted as [[militarist]] and expansionist which turned out to inspire pride and confidence in the resistance against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt; In order to establish Korean uniqueness, he also replaced the story of [[Gija Joseon]], whose founder ([[Jizi|Gija]]) was the paternal uncle or brother of the Chinese [[Shang]] emperor [[King Zhou of Shang|Zhou]], with the Dangun legend&lt;ref&gt;Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria: Som Cj’aeho and the Politics of Territorial History in Korea," in The Journal of Asian Studies, 56, no. 1 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that it was an important way to establish Korea’s uniqueness.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt;

After independence in the late 1940s, despite the split between North and South Korea, neither side disputed the ethnic homogeneity of the Korean nation based on a firm conviction that they are purest descendant of a legendary genitor and half-god figure called Dangun who founded [[Gojoseon]] in 2333 BCE based on the description of the ''[[Dongguk Tonggam]]'' (1485).&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=694&amp;isid=30674&amp;arid=657709&amp;topMenu=&amp;topMenu1= Old Choson and the Culture of the Mandolin-shaped Bronze Dagger], Kim Jung-bae&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In both Koreas, pure blood theory is a common belief,&lt;ref name=soksoo&gt;Kim Sok-soo, professor at Kyungpook National University, cited in Park Chung-a, "[http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html Myth of Pure-Blood Nationalism Blocks Multi-Ethnic Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232752/http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html |date=2011-07-25 }}," ''The Korea Times'', August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with even some South Korean presidents subscribing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|title=What the West gets wrong about North Korea's motives, and why some South Koreans admire the North|first=B.R.|last=Myers|publisher=The Conversation|date=September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916082701/http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates on this topic can be found sporadic in the South, whereas the public opinion in the North is hard to access. In a nationalistic view, to impugn or challenge the theory would have been tantamount to betraying Koreanness in the face of the challenge of an alien ethnic nation.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;

Some Korean scholars observed that the pure blood theory served as a useful tool for the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt; It was especially true in the dictatorial leaderships by former presidents [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] when nationalism was incorporated into anti-Communism.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt;

===Role in contemporary South Korean society===
In South Korea, the notion of "pure blood" results in discrimination toward people of both "foreign-blood" and "mixed blood".&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; Those with this "mixed blood" or "foreign blood" are sometimes referred to as ''Honhyeol'' ({{Korean|혼혈|{{lang|ko|[[wikt:混#Korean|混]][[wikt:血#Korean|血]]}}}}) in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Timothy|title=Rethinking Belongingness in Korea: Transnational Migration, ‘Migrant Marriages,’ and the Politics of Multiculturalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/3605631/Rethinking_Belongingness_in_Korea_Transnational_Migration_Migrant_Marriages_and_the_Politics_of_Multiculturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]]&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; instead of [[jus solis]], which is a territorial principle that takes into account the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; In 2005, the opposition [[Grand National Party]] suggested a revision of the current South Korean nationality law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt;


According to Jon Huer, a columnist for the ''Korea Times'': {{quote|In trying to understand [South] Korea and [South] Koreans, we must recognize how important blood is to [South] Korea. [South] Koreans love blood, both in the real sense and metaphorically. They like to shed blood, sometimes their own in cut fingers and sometimes animal blood, in protest. They hold "blood relations" as supreme, above other links and connections. They often add "flesh" and "bone" to their rhetorical statements and preferences. In short, [South] Korea is quite fond of thinking of itself and its people in terms of blood...&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/06/272_47907.html|title=Korean Blood, Real and Imagined|date=3 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Challenges and the future====
Emma Campbell from the [[Australian National University]] argues that the conceptions of South Korean nationalism is evolving among young people and that a new form is emerging that has globalised cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Emma |date=22 June 2015 |title=The end of ethnic nationalism?

However, these who are in favor of a [[Korean unification]] state reasons different from [[ethnic nationalism]]. The respondents stated that they only wanted unification if it would not disrupt the life in the South or if North Korea achieves economic parity with the South. A small number of respondents further mentioned that they support a "unification on the condition that it did not take place in their lifetime."&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; Another reason stated for the wish for unification was the access to North Korea’s natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; This notion of evolving nationalism has been further elaborated by the meaning of ''uri nara'' ({{lang-ko|우리나라}} ''my country'' [sic!]) for young South Koreans, which only refers to South Korea for them instead to the whole Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 488-489 --&gt; Campbell’s interviews further showed that many young South Koreans have no problems to accepting foreigners as part of ''uri nara''.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 492 --&gt;

====Criticism====
B. R. Myers noted in a 2010 ''New York Times'' editorial that there was relatively little public outrage in South Korea over the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ROKS ''Cheonan'']] earlier that year, which he attributed partly to a feeling of sympathy towards North Korea among South Koreans, resulting from a closer identification with the Korean race than with the South Korean state.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |title=South Korea's Collective Shrug |date=27 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024409/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |archivedate=April 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers also stated that race nationalism in South Korea undermines the South Korean citizenry's patriotism towards South Korea by increasing sympathy towards North Korea, thus threatening the country's national security in the face of North Korean aggression, a sentiment shared by ''Korea Times'' columnist Jon Huer.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt; He stated that South Koreans' race nationalism "is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/08/01/51/0302000000AEN20110801002700315F.HTML|title=(Yonhap Feature) Brian Myers: Korea's most dangerous writer? - YONHAP NEWS|website=english.yonhapnews.co.kr|quote=This is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers has also stated that conversely, North Korea does not suffer from this dilemma as by and large the North Korean people tend to equate the "Korean race" and the country of North Korea as being one and the same, unlike in South Korea where the "Korean race" and South Korea are largely seen as different entities, the former positively, the latter negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freekorea.us/2017/08/01/propaganda-in-the-age-of-kim-jong-un-a-discussion-with-professor-b-r-myers/#sthash.eScL76im.dpbs|title=Propaganda in the age of Kim Jong-Un: A discussion with Professor B.R.

However, while some South Koreans are fascinated by the bi-racial sportsman, the majority of ordinary mixed-race people and migrant workers face various forms of discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; In 2007, the "Korean pure blood theory" became an international issue when the U.N. Committee on the International Convention Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination urged better education on the pure blood theory is needed especially for judicial workers such as police officers, lawyers, prosecutors and judges.&lt;ref name=kbs&gt;[http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=4&amp;key=2007081906 U.N.

In 2007 the South Korean government passed the [[Act on Treatment of Foreigners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=47580|title=Korean Laws in English - Act on the Treatment of Foreigners in Korea|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|title=Minority Rights Group International : South Korea : South Korea Overview|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613001710/http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hurights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2008/10/south-korea-support-for-multicultural-families-act-enacted.html|title=South Korea; Support for Multicultural Families Act Enacted - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] praised the Act on Treatment of Foreigners, but also expressed a number of concerns. The Committee was concerned "about the persistence of widespread societal discrimination against foreigners, including migrant workers and children born from inter-ethnic unions, in all areas of life, including employment, marriage, housing, education and interpersonal relationships." It also noted that the terminology such as "pure blood" and "mixed blood" used in South Korea, including by the government, is widespread, and may reinforce concepts of [[Racial superiority|racist superiority]]. The committee recommended improvement in the areas of treatment of migrant workers, abuse of and violence against foreign women married to South Korean citizens, and trafficking of foreign women for the purpose of sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.&lt;ref name=uncom&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/473424062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted that contrary to popular domestic perception, South Korea was no longer "ethnically homogenous".&lt;ref name=nytimes2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=2 November 2009|location=New York|title=Race|publisher=New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legislation aimed at improving the integration of ethnic minorities into South Korean society, the [[Support for Multicultural Families Act]], was passed in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=58481|title=Korean Laws in English - SUPPORT FOR MULTICULTURAL FAMILIES ACT|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and revised in 2011).&lt;ref name=hurights/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=89160|title=Gov’t extends definition of multicultural families|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2009 statistics published by South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, there were 144,385 couples of international marriage in South Korea as of May 2008. 88.4% of immigrants were female, and 61.9% were from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.naver.com/view.nhn?doc_id=39555627&amp;dir_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;query=%EB%8B%A4%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%20%ED%86%B5%EA%B3%84|title=2009년 다문화가족 통계현황 (09년 4월현재):네이버 전문정보|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently{{When|date=January 2016}} it has been argued that South Korean society had already become a multicultural society, although foreigners make up for 3.4% of the South Korean population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sung-won|first1=Eum|title=Number of foreign residents in S.

Existing provisions in South Korean criminal law may be used to punish acts of racial discrimination, but were never used for that purpose&lt;ref name=uncom/&gt; until 2009, when the first case of a South Korean citizen verbally insulting a foreigner have been brought to court.&lt;ref name=nytimes2009/&gt;

In 2010, the South Korean government changed the oath of enlistment of Korean soldiers, so that they do not swear allegiance anymore to the Korean race, stating that this shows openness to multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/04/18/2011041801112.html |title=New Pledge of Allegiance to Reflect Growing Multiculturalism |quote=The military has decided to omit the word 'minjok,' which refers to the Korean race, from the oath of enlistment for officers and soldiers, and replace it with 'the citizen.'

In 2017, [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] actress [[Jamie Chung]], who had auditioned for a role in the movie [[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]] but was turned down for allegedly not being [[Han Chinese|"ethnically Chinese"]], called the movie's casting of [[Multiracial|biracial]] actor [[Henry Golding (actor)|Henry Golding]] as "bullshit" in an interview; Golding, who is of English and [[Iban people|Malaysian Iban]] descent, had been cast as the [[Chinese Singaporean]] character Nick Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamie-chung-on-the-double-edged-sword-of-being-a-minority-in-hollywood/|title=Jamie Chung on the "double-edged sword" of being a minority in Hollywood|publisher=|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chung's remarks were heavily criticized, with many accusing her of being bigoted or racist against [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] and promoting [[racial purity]] by assuming Golding was not "Asian enough" to play an Asian character, despite the actor's cultural ties and upbringing in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crazy-rich-asians-henry-golding-casting_us_5a1f172ce4b0d52b8dc2632e|title='Crazy Rich Asians' Star Claps Back At Criticism That He's 'Not Asian Enough'|first=Kimberly|last=Yam|date=November 30, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=February 5, 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metaphorical language''' is the use of a complex system of [[metaphor]]s to create a sub-language within a common language which provides the basic terms ([[verb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]) to express metaphors.

People who over-expose themselves to environments atypical from their usual habits tend to develop understanding of new words and apply new meanings to existing words. Such sources could include: absorbing a native language spoken in a different dialects or countries, a language other than their own and fictional language from books, music, films and videogames.

People who are classified with Autistic Spectrum Disorder tend to communicate metaphorically rather than with common phrases. It is currently not known why they can do this, although they also express other abnormalities from level 1 and 2 psychedelic experiences.

==History==
Metaphorical language is a common feature of religious discussion, (for example [[midrash]] or medieval [[Roman Catholic]] "[[Commonplace book|common places]]" or modern [[biblespeak]]) wherein fluency in a religious text is often a prerequisite to participating fully in a conversation.  Not just [[conceptual metaphor]]s (part of every language) that express belief in analogy between generic concepts, but extremely specific metaphors involving [[proper name]]s or use of concrete nouns to express generics or processes.

The [[Tao te ching]] is considered by many to be almost entirely metaphorical. For example, change is usually expressed with the “water” character, not the “change” character. 

To the outsider, such terms in such combinations will likely seem [[esoteric]] or otherwise unintelligible.  Only by learning the underlying patterns of events that are considered important in the religion or ethical or political system, would one be able to comprehend what was said.  The religious text thus acts as a [[code book]].  Since many religious authorities believe in the self-evident truth of their [[doctrine]]s, a mere exposure to the [[truth]] in the book would tend to convert outsiders trying to learn the language.  However, use of such language is not confined to religious groups

Use of metaphorical language was historically common among [[secret society]] devotees, for instance the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|Tong]]s that resisted Imperial rulers, and even some modern [[troll organization]]s.

[[File:Reach Toronto.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5| The ''Monument to Multiculturalism'' in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Four identical sculptures are located in [[Buffalo City Local Municipality|Buffalo City]], [[South Africa]]; in [[Changchun]], [[China]]; in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]] and in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].|alt=]]

The term '''multiculturalism''' has a range of meanings within the contexts of [[sociology]], of [[political philosophy]], and of colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "[[Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism]]", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a [[cultural pluralism]] in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an aboriginal or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century).

Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely,&lt;ref name="Harper2011"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas L. Harper|title= Dialogues in urban and regional planning|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7mZOF_gFhfYC&amp;pg=PA50|date= 13 January 2011|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 978-0-415-59334-2|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} through policies of promoting the maintenance of [[cultural diversity]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} to policies in which people of various [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group to which they belong.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite web|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Multiculturalism |title= Dictionary.Reference.com |publisher= Dictionary.Reference.com |accessdate= 2010-12-10 | quote = multiculturalism [:] the preservation of different cultures or cultural identities within a unified society, as a state or nation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianmalik"&gt;{{cite news|author= Kenan Malik |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/multiculturalism-diversity-political-policy |title= Multiculturalism undermines diversity | work = The Guardian |publisher= Guardian |date= 2010-03-17 |accessdate= 2010-12-10 |location= London | quote = As a political process, however, multiculturalism [...] describes a set of policies, the aim of which is to manage diversity by putting people into ethnic boxes, defining individual needs and rights by virtue of the boxes into which people are put, and using those boxes to shape public policy.

Multiculturalism that promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures is often contrasted{{by whom|date=September 2018}} to other [[settler|settlement]] policies such as [[social integration]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[racial segregation]]. Multiculturalism has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" and as a "[[cultural mosaic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |page= 31|title= Guide to Western Canada|edition= 7th|first1= Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2= Tom |last2= Burgess|publisher= Globe Pequot Press|year= 2005|isbn= 0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in contrast to a [[melting pot]].&lt;ref&gt;

Two different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different government policies and strategies. The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures; this approach is also often known{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as [[interculturalism]]. The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness, which can sometimes{{quantify|date=September 2018}} result in [[Ethnic competition thesis|intercultural competition over jobs]] (among other things) and may lead to [[ethnic conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2011/february/europes-multiculturalism-leading-to-civil-war-/?mobile=false|title= Europe's Multiculturalism Leading to Civil War? – World – CBN News – Christian News 24-7 |website= www.cbn.com|access-date= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ifamericansknew.org/history/|title= A Synopsis of the Israel/Palestine Conflict|last= Knew|first= If Americans|website= www.ifamericansknew.org|access-date= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions surrounding the issue of cultural isolation may address the [[ghettoization]] of a culture within a nation and the protection of the cultural attributes of an area or of a nation.

==Prevalence==
In the [[political philosophy]] of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and religious differences. It is often associated with "identity politics", "the politics of difference", and "the politics of recognition". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="ZarateLevy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&amp;pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiculturalism has been official policy in several [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/pp4.htm |title=Policy Paper no. 4 – Multiculturalism: New Policy Responses to Diversity |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ai-ia/rir-iro/gbll/divers/index-eng.cfm |title=Multiculturalism in Canada |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |title=Immigration and Multiculturalism |publisher=.gu.edu.au |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219034150/http://www4.gu.edu.au/ext/civics/cv02/mod03/cv02m03t02.htm |archivedate=2011-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/claval-s2.pdf |title=Multiculturalism and the Dynamics of Modern Civilizations |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|doi=10.1163/15718119720907408|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|journal= International Journal of Group Rights|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|volume=5|issue=1|pages= 33–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/ujjal-dosanjh-by-silencing-white-men-canada-cant-have-an-honest-debate-about-equality-race-and-culture|title=Ujjal Dosanjh: By silencing white men, Canada can't have an honest debate about equality, race and culture|last=|first=|date=4 January 2016|work=|newspaper=National Post|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="II2010."&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[contact hypothesis]] in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as "differentialist racism", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived "incompatibility of life-styles and traditions".&lt;ref name="Gunew 2004 80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunew|first=Sneja|title=Haunted Nations: The colonial dimensions of multiculturalisms|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=11 New Fetter Lane, London EC4P 4EE|isbn=0-415-28483-X|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Putnam |first = Robert D. |author-link = Robert D.

People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = [[The American Conservative]] |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us".&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Putnam has also stated, however, that "this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michel, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663 Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?]" Tell Me More, NPR. Written 15 August 2007, accessed 15 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnologist]] [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Lamm |first = Richard D. |title = I have a plan to destroy America |url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp |website = Snopes.com |date = 2005 |access-date = 12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of conservative historians used the religion of the Mexica, better known as the Aztecs as an example of what they see as the flaws of multiculturalism. The Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] cited the accounts of his fellow Australian historian [[Inga Clendinnen]] of the festival of [[Ochpaniztli]] where to honor the Maize Lord a young woman was sacrificed by ripping out her heart so the crops might grow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, still in darkness, silence, and urgent haste, her body was flayed, and a naked priest, a 'very strong man, very powerful, very tall', struggled into the wet skin, with its slack breasts and pouched genitalia: a double nakedness of layered, ambiguous sexuality. The skin of one thigh was reserved to be fashioned into a face-mask for the man impersonating Centeotl, Young Lord Maize Cob, the son of Toci.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga ''Aztecs: An Interpretation'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995. p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Windschuttle argued that the gruesome religion of the Aztecs that required that dozens of young people be sacrificed and eaten every day so that the sun might rise the next day and hundreds of people sacrificed for major holidays as proving that multiculturalism is a facile doctrine that requires Westerners to respect Aztec religion as equal to any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Windshuttle, Keith ''The Killing of History How Literary Critics and Social Theorists Are Murdering Our Past'',  San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The American classicist [[Victor Davis Hanson]] used the perceived differences in "rationality" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.&lt;ref name="Hanson, Victor Davis 2001. p. 205"&gt;Hanson, Victor Davis ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power'', New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the [[Māori people|Maori]], and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Maori demands for self determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Johnson |first = Jay T. |title = Indigeneity's challenges to the White Settler-State: creating a thirdspace for dynamic citizenship |journal = [[Alternatives: Global, Local, Political]] |volume = 33 |issue = 1 |pages = 29–52 |doi = 10.1177/030437540803300103 |date = January 2008 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is a controversial country when is comes to defining a multicultural country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/18/the-most-and-least-culturally-diverse-countries-in-the-world/|title=A revealing map of the world’s most and least ethnically diverse countries|last=|first=|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two views, in which the Harvard Institute of Economic Research states that Brazil has an intersection of many culture because of recent migration.

===Mexico===
[[File:Mexico City 335.jpg|thumb|Mexico City]]
[[Mexico]] has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]] to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous' religion, politics, culture and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mexico1539.blogspot.com/2008/10/consecuencias-de-la-conquista-de-mexico.html|title=mas alla de la historia: Consecuencias de la conquista de mexico|last=México|first=Conquista De|date=2008-10-29|website=mas alla de la historia|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish opened schools in which they taught [[Christianity]], and the Spanish language which it eventually surpassed the indigenous dialects and languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Index |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1932-ethnic-diversity-in-mexico |title=Ethnic diversity in Mexico : Mexico Travel |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world "Mestizo" has become an umbrella term to those that are non-indigenous, which would include Asian Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-22|title=Wayback Machine|date=2013-10-22|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching an amount of 961,121 people.

It is considered to be a [[cradle of civilization]], which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the [[mestizaje]] of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

=== Peru ===
[[Peru]] is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática|INEI]] reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.

Peru is the home to [[Amerindians]] but after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]], the Spanish brought African, and Asian people as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 45% of the population, [[mestizo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 37%, [[White people|white]] 15% and 3% is composed by [[Black people|Black]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/country/Peru/population.htm|title=Peru population.

Which attracted Italians, Portuguese, French and German people in look for some [[guano]] for their crops.

In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level, but ethnic diversity is common in both rural and urban areas.

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Katherine Isaacs|title=Immigration and emigration in historical perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5asNot0c5kwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-498-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's [[national myth]]. The idea of the [[melting pot]] is a [[metaphor]] that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Israel. ''The Melting Pot,'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different than multiculturalism as defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration.&lt;ref name="Suárez-OrozcoSuárez-Orozco2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco|author2=Carola Suárez-Orozco|title=The new immigration: an interdisciplinary reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a05uTxwIC4EC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94916-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Americanized (and often stereotypical) version of the original nation's cuisine, and its holidays, survived.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding fathers]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jay]], ''First American Supreme Court Chief Justice'', [[Federalist No. 2|Federalist Paper No. 2]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:President Clinton's Initiative on Race.jpg|thumb|Staff of President Clinton's [[One America Initiative]]. The President's Initiative on Race was a critical element in President Clinton's effort to prepare the country to embrace diversity.]]
As a [[philosophy]], multiculturalism began as part of the [[pragmatism]] movement at the end of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]] and the United States, then as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political]] and [[cultural pluralism]] at the turn of the twentieth.&lt;ref name="CaputiFoster2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Caputi|author2=Heather Foster|author3=Linda L.

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[John Dewey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]." James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news |last=Boening |first=Astrid B. |title=Euro-Islam&amp;nbsp;– A Constructivist Idea or a Concept of the English School? |newspaper=European Union Miami Analysis (EUMA) |location= |volume=4

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the [[grade school]] system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

The [[European Union]] is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an aging population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=502&amp;langId=en|title=Demographic analysis|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wikt:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guntram Henrik Herb |author2=David H. Kaplan |title=Nations and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the [[Sweden Democrats]], multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964–1975|last=Wickström|first=Mats|publisher=Åbo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|location=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|title=Svenskar vill ha inhägnat boende {{!}} SvD|last=TT|first=|date=|work=SvD.se|access-date=2018-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322170850/http://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|archive-date=22 March 2016|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published by [[Gävle University College]] showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|title=Mångfaldsbarometern 2014|last=|first=|publisher=Gävle University College|year=October 2014|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094211/https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Cultural pluralism|Pluralism]], [[Unity in diversity|diversity]] and multiculturalism is a daily fact of life in [[Indonesia]]. There are over [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|300 ethnic groups]] in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni – Far East, A world of difference. p. 88.

Indonesia's national motto, ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one") enshrined in [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Geography of Indonesia | publisher=Indonesia.go.id | url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/geography-indonesia|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of [[Javanization]], although [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], Madurese, [[Bugis]] and Makassar people, as a result of their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while [[Chinese Indonesian]]s can be found in most urban areas. Because of [[urbanization]], major Indonesian cities such as [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Palembang]], [[Medan]] and [[Makassar]] have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the [[Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto]] in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes against [[Madurese people|Madurese]] transmigrants in [[Kalimantan]] during [[Sambas riots]] in 1999&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=February 28, 2001|title=Indonesia: The Violence in Central Kalimantan (Borneo)|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/borneo0228.htm|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sampit conflict]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="flashpoint"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=June 28, 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints: Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as [[Poso riots|violence erupted in Poso]] between 1998 and into 2000,&lt;ref name="BBC flashpoints"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = BBC News| date = 28 June 2004| title = Indonesia flashpoints: Sulawesi| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3812737.stm| accessdate = 13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maluku sectarian conflict|violences in Maluku]] between 1999 and into 2002.&lt;ref name="timedirty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elegant|first=Simon|title=Indonesia's Dirty Little Holy War|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187655,00.html|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=Time|date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

[[Chinese Indonesians]] are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discrimination]]. The [[Suharto]] ''Orde Baru'' or New Order adopted a forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]], and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13–14 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared that the [[Chinese New Year]] (''{{lang|id|Imlek}}'') would be marked as a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] from 2003.{{sfn|Setiono|2003|p=1099}} Today, Chinese Indonesians enjoy the same rights as other Indonesians.

===Japan===
{{main|Ethnic issues in Japan}}
[[File:One Ainu man and bear.JPG|thumb|An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] man, circa 1930]]
Japanese society, with its ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe fine with 'homogeneous' remark|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/02/27/national/abe-fine-with-homogeneous-remark/#.U9KWz4BdWwE|work=Japan Times|date=2007-02-27|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, former Japanese Prime Minister and current Japanese Deputy Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] described Japan as a "one civilization, one language, one culture and one race" nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/10/18/national/aso-says-japan-is-nation-of-one-race/#.U9KXSIBdWwE |title=Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race' |work=Japan Times |date=October 18, 2005 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are "International Society" NPOs funded by local governments throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-international.org/ |title=International Societies in Japan |publisher=Tokyo-international.org |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226025402/http://www.tokyo-international.org/ |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Harvard University]] professor [[Theodore Bestor]], Japan does look very homogeneous from a distant perspective, but in fact there are a number of very significant minority groups – ethnically different minority groups – in Japan today, such as the already mentioned [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/at/contemp_japan/cjp_society_02.html |title=Contemporary Japan: Japanese Society |publisher=Asian Topics, [[Columbia University]] |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu|Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Demographics of Malaysia|Culture of Malaysia}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Kedayan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of racial equalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[13 May Incident|13 May racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Singapore===
Because of immigration, [[Singapore]] has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of [[Malay people|Malays]] and Indians (predominantly [[Tamil people|Tamils]]). Other prominent smaller groups include [[Peranakans]] and [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]]. Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages—[[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages ("mother tongues"). Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

During British colonial rule, ethnic enclaves such as [[Geylang]], [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] were enforced. Presently &lt;sup&gt;(2010)&lt;/sup&gt;, remnants of colonial ethnic concentration still exist but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]]. Retrieved: November 18, 2010 from [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home''].&lt;/ref&gt; A similar policy exists in politics as all [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]] are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority.

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19991013000846/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]" (1999), Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol. 47 No. 4, Winter 2007, pp. 32–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111757/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the ''[[JoongAng Ilbo]]'' stated: "Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." He further opined:
:"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Underwood |first=Peter |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |title=Multiculturalism in Korea |work=JoongAng Ilbo |location=South Korea |publisher=JoongAng Ilbo |accessdate=2 September 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902022520/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |archivedate=September 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
[[Turkey]] is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persians decent. This entail influence of Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim influence leaving Turkey to be a multicultural country based on location.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauf|first=Imam Feisal Abdul|date=2005|title=MULTICULTURALISMS: Western, Muslim and Future|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24461190|journal=CrossCurrents|volume=55|issue=1|pages=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kaya|first=Ayhan|title=Multiculturalism and Minorities in Turkey|date=2013|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20|work=Challenging Multiculturalism|pages=297–316|series=European Models of Diversity|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|doi=10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20#page_scan_tab_contents|isbn=9780748664573|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-populated-countries-in-africa.html|title=The 10 Most Populated Countries in Africa|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|title=Census 2011 Census in Brief|last=|first=|date=2015-05-13|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa's cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised, it is still known for its diverse culture.

===Cameroon===
Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, [[Cameroon]] is found in [[central Africa]] consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, most people commonly label Cameroon as “Africa in Miniature”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbenda|first=Huguette Gaelle Ngassa|last2=Awasthi|first2=Gauri|last3=Singh|first3=Poonam K|last4=Gouado|first4=Inocent|last5=Das|first5=Aparup|date=2014-07-16|title=Does malaria epidemiology project Cameroon as ‘Africa in miniature’?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=727–738|doi=10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americas

==== Demographics and Official Languages ====
Before Cameroon’s independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916-1961.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Upon gaining [[sovereignty]], a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhidin_Mulalic/publication/325217271_Perceptions_of_Turkish_Cultural_Diplomacy_in_Bosnia-Herzegovina/links/5afe90e8458515e9a5765501/Perceptions-of-Turkish-Cultural-Diplomacy-in-Bosnia-Herzegovina.pdf#page=261|title=Can Bilingualism Survive in Cameroon?|last=Asanga Fon|first=Nguh Nwei|date=2018-07-26|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin]] known as [[Camfranglais|Frananglais]] gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newuh.blog/2012/12/13/cameroon-africa-in-miniature-in-what-sense/|title=Cameroon: Africa in Miniature – In what Sense?|date=2012-12-13|work=KINGSLEY SHETEH'S BLOG|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Languages ====
Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], Sudanic, [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]], [[Wodaabe]] (or [[Mbororo]]) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon|title=Cameroon {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwgia.org/en/cameroon|title=Cameroon|website=www.iwgia.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Peoples' Rights ====
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly ([[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]]) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]]) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from [[wiktionary:Exploitation|exploiting]] or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-12-01|title=Indigenous peoples’ land rights in Cameroon: progress to date and possible futures|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17448IIED/|journal=Briefing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in "local, regional, and national levels" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/rights-land-natural-resources/news-article/2017/declaration-land-rights-gbabandi-platform-cameroon|title=Declaration on land rights from the Gbabandi Platform, Cameroon {{!}} Forest Peoples Programme|website=www.forestpeoples.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
[[Morocco]] is located in Northern Africa near the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which then connects to Europe. Morocco is a prime location for a multiculturalism, as it has much influence by neighbouring countries. Morocco has been invaded and colonised by many countries throughout the centuries, which means that they have experienced an influence of many cultures. Some of these invaders include the [[French people|French]], the [[Spaniards]], the [[Arabs]], and several more countries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This has led to the country becoming not only multicultural, but also multilingual. Officially the language of Morocco is [[Arabic]], but throughout the country many people speak, French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Arabic, and most recently acknowledging [[Berber languages|Berber]] as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2014|title=Recognizing the Berber Language in Morocco: A Step for Democratization|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773631|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|volume=15|issue=2|pages=93–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much outside influence of multiculturalism in Morocco, but they have embraced these cultures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1f327fa4-9836-4bc5-995e-327ca3017228@pdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=54652194&amp;db=a9h|title=Multiculturalism, Gender and Political Participation in Morocco: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Multiculturalism in Australia}}
The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf |title=IMMI.gov.au |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government retains multiculturalism in policy, and as a defining aspect of Australia today.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Team to Build a Stronger Australia|url=http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/16/hon-tony-abbott-mp-press-release-team-build-stronger-australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106010039/http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/16/hon-tony-abbott-mp-press-release-team-build-stronger-australia|archivedate=2013-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]] is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's [[White Australia Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI) (2000). ''Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration''. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. pp. 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it would later follow suit with Australia in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration|title=History of immigration – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jock (11 August 2015).

'''Mysophobia''', also known as '''verminophobia''', '''germophobia''', '''germaphobia''', '''bacillophobia''' and '''bacteriophobia''', is a [[pathological fear]] of contamination and [[Microorganism|germs]]. The term was coined by [[William A. Hammond]] in 1879 when describing a case of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) exhibited in repeatedly washing one's hands.&lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrbqCbV5xvMC|title=Neurological Contributions|first=William Alexander|last=Hammond|date=1879|page=40|publisher=Putnam|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysophobia has long been related to compulsive [[hand washing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/cleanliness-rules-germaphobes-lives|title=Cleanliness Rules Germaphobes' Lives|website=WebMD|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Names pertaining directly to the abnormal fear of dirt and filth include molysmophobia or molysomophobia, rhypophobia, and rupophobia, whereas the terms bacillophobia and bacteriophobia specifically refer to the fear of [[bacteria]] and [[microbes]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phobiasource.com/bacillophobia-fear-of-microbes/ |title=Bacillophobia – Fear of microbes |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}{{unreliable source|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mysophobia'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μύσος (''musos''), "uncleanness"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmu%2Fsos1 μύσος],  Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and φόβος (''phobos''), "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nanodumbell''' is a pair of spheres attached together that may be made of silica or zinc oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10854-014-2470-5 |title=Investigation on the influence of dichromate ion on the ZnO nano-dumbbells and ZnCr2O4 nano-walls |journal=Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=821–829 |year=2014 |last1=Dixit |first1=Tejendra |last2=Palani |first2=I.

They have been used in a [[Purdue University]] experiment where they were made to spin in a vacuum at 60 billion rotations per minute.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/63139-fastest-spinner-nanodumbbell.html|title=What in the Whirled?

==Description==
The nanodumbbells are first created in the lab using a hydro-thermal process. The resulting dumbbell consists of two joined silica spheres, making it 320 nanometers long and around 170 nanometers wide in size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nanodumbbells are also being studied for possible use in [[photodynamic therapy]], a way of treating cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2017.01.053 |pmid=28167424 |title=Construction of near infrared light triggered nanodumbbell for cancer photodynamic therapy |journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science |volume=494 |pages=363–372 |year=2017 |last1=Hou |first1=Beibei |last2=Zheng |first2=Bin |last3=Yang |first3=Weitao |last4=Dong |first4=Chunhong |last5=Wang |first5=Hanjie |last6=Chang |first6=Jin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiment==
Highly focused circularly polarized light laser light bombards the levitated dumbbell to set it spinning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Previous records==
The speed of  the rotation is a world record that beats previous records. In 2008, a small motor rotated at 1 million rotations per minute. In 2010, a slice of graphene was made to spin at 60 million spins per minute. Around 2013, a  sphere measuring just 4 micrometers was spun at 600 million spins per minute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the study of religion, '''orthopraxy''' is correct conduct, both [[ethical]] and [[liturgical]], as opposed to [[faith]] or [[Divine grace|grace]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Elizabeth |title=The Illustrated Dictionary of Culture |publisher=Lotus Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-89093-26-6 |pages= 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westley |first=Miles |title=The Bibliophile's Dictionary |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |year=2005 |pages=91 |isbn=978-1-58297-356-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKim |first=Donald K. |title=Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1996 |pages=197 |isbn=978-0-664-25511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[orthodoxy]], which emphasizes correct belief, and [[wikt:ritualism|ritualism]], the practice of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKim |first=Donald K. |title=Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=1996 |pages=197, 242 |isbn=978-0-664-25511-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[neoclassical compound]]—{{lang|grc|ὀρθοπραξία}} (''orthopraxia'') meaning 'correct practice'.

While orthodoxies make use of codified beliefs, in the form of [[creed]]s, and ritualism more narrowly centers on the strict adherence to prescribed [[rite]]s or [[ritual]]s, orthopraxy is focused on [[Complex family|issues of family]], [[Cultural heritage|cultural integrity]], the transmission of [[tradition]], [[sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]], [[Ritual purity|concerns of purity]], [[ethical system]], and the enforcement thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Antes |first=Peter |author2=Armin W.

Typically, traditional or [[folk religion]]s ([[paganism]], [[animism]]) are more concerned with orthopraxy than orthodoxy, and some{{Who|date=October 2017}} argue that equating the term "[[faith]]" with "[[religion]]" presents a [[Christian]]-[[bias]]ed notion of what the primary characteristic of religion is. This contrasts with the case of (for example) [[Hinduism]], in which orthopraxy and ritualism are not easily disentangled.

==Etymology==
From the Greek ''orthos'' "straight" + ''praxis'' "action", first used in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 3rd ed&lt;/ref&gt; there are two versions of the term: "orthopraxis" and "orthopraxy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Orthopraxy" is the older and more common term, and is parallel to "orthodoxy".

==Christianity==
[[Image:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]] monument at the [[Texas State Capitol]]. &lt;!-- Included is the commandment to "Remember the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath day]], to keep it holy". --&gt;]]
{{Main|Christian ethics|Good works}}
{{See also|New Perspective on Paul}}
Although traditionally Christianity is seen as primarily orthodoxical (as in the [[Nicene Creed]]'s "I believe in ..."), some [[Christian denominations]] and leaders today, from [[Roman Catholic]] to [[Evangelical Christian]]s, have started to describe their religions as both orthodoxical and orthopraxic. The premise is correct belief compels correct action, and incorrect action is caused by incorrect beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Francesca Aran |title=Christ the Form of Beauty: A Study in Theology and Literature |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |pages=150–151 |isbn=978-0-567-09708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See also'': John 5:1–18; 8:13–19; 10:24–33; 11:45–54; 18–19:16 (Demonstrates how correct/incorrect belief causes correct/incorrect action from a biblical perspective.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking this combination of "correct belief" and "correct action" a step further, [[prosperity theology]], found in charismatic and Pentecostal traditions, teaches correct religious belief and behavior receives material reward and physical healing, in addition to being a necessary component for accepting God's [[Divine grace|grace]]. Prosperity theology is a concept known as reciprocity when discussing traditional or ethnic religions such as that in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], but is limited to correct behavior over any one theological idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill |first=Christopher |author2=Norman Postlethwaite |author3=Richard Seaford |title=Reciprocity in Ancient Greece |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-814997-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of [[biblical law in Christianity]] is disputed. Most Christians believe that some or all of the [[Ten Commandments]] are still binding or have been reinstituted in the [[law of Christ]]. A minority of Christians are [[Mitzvah|Torah-observant]] and at the other extreme are [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism among Christians|antinomian]] and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchistic]] views.

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Praxis (Byzantine Rite)}}
{{See also|Orthodox Church}}
Praxis is a key to understanding the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] tradition, which is observed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and some [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint [[Maximus the Confessor]]: "Theology without action is the theology of demons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kF4cAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Theology+without+action+is+the+theology+of+demons%22&amp;dq=%22Theology+without+action+is+the+theology+of+demons%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C4mVVN-zNMvT7AafzoHoDg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw Virginia Fabella, Sergio Torres (editors), ''Doing Theology in a Divided World''] (Orbis Books 1985 {{ISBN|978-0-88344197-8}}), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_7VKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 Paul W. Chilcote, ''Wesley Speaks on Christian Vocation''] (Wipf and Stock 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57910812-0}}), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburgh2010.org/fileadmin/files/edinburgh2010/files/docs/Mission%20among%20Other%20Faiths_Orthodox%20Perspective%20090820.doc Mission among Other Faiths: An Orthodox Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

Union with [[God]], to which Christians hold that [[Jesus]] invited man, requires not just [[faith]], but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the [[Biblical canon|Scriptures]] ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Cor]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=011&amp;l=2 11:2],
[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thes]] [http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&amp;bk=60&amp;ch=002&amp;l=14 2:14]) and the [[Church Fathers]], and is linked with the term ''praxis'' in Byzantine [[theology]] and vocabulary.[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/ortho-praxis/] In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of 'theory and practice'.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040606120041/http://arts.tuirgin.com/] Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox ''do''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040808164646/http://www.orthodoxpraxis.org/article.php?id=2&amp;menu=1] Praxis is 'living Orthodoxy'.[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/rose_wv.aspx]

Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with [[worship]]. "[[Orthopraxis]]" is said to mean "right glory" or "right worship"[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/index.aspx]; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of [[liturgy]] (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the [[Western Christianity|West]], Christianity has been reduced "to intellectual, ethical or social categories," whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the [[Body of Christ]] and providing the path to "true religious education."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070510124549/http://www.sf.goarch.org/religioused/TheOrthodoxDifference.htm] A "symbiosis of worship and work" is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040702211116/http://www.syrianorthodoxarchdiocese.com/anagalpura.html]

In the case of [[Hinduism]] orthopraxy and ritualism are conflated. Emphasis on ritual vs. personal salvation (''[[moksha]]'') was a major division in classical [[Hindu philosophy]], epitomized by [[Purva Mimamsa]] vs. [[Uttara Mimamsa]] (Vedanta).

Ritual (''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'') continues to play a central role in contemporary [[Hinduism]], but the enormous complexity of ancient ritual (''[[yajna]]'') only survives in a tiny minority of [[Shrauta]] practitioners. Even Hindus who diligently practice a subset of prescribed rituals are called orthoprax, to contrast them with other Hindus who insist on the importance of correct belief or understanding. The correctness of one's interpretation of the scripture is then considered less important than following traditions. For example, [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] was a well-known example of an orthoprax Hindu.

In terms of "proper conduct" and other ethical precepts within the Hindu framework,  the core belief involves the divinity of each individual soul (''[[jiva]]tma''). Each person harbors this "indwelling God (divinity)"; thus, conduct which unifies society and facilitates progress is emphasized. Self-centered existence is discouraged as a result of this ''jivatma'' concept. The Uttara Mimamsa philosophical school explicates this concept eloquently.  Moreover, within the context of Uttara Mimamsa the role of ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' (ritual) also involves bringing the individual ''jivatma'' closer to the ''[[Paramatma]]'' (the Transcendent Divinity or God). Individuals who have attained this merging then become the spiritual guides to the community. Later developments within the Hindu religious and philosophic tradition thus try to unify these concepts of ritual, proper conduct, and personal salvation instead of leaving them in mutually conflicting terms. The movement inspired by [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] termed ''[[Swadhyaya]]'' seems to be one manifestation of this syncretism. However, other movements within the contemporary Hindu scene are also moving towards this union of external activity and internal development.

==Islam==
{{See|Five Pillars of Islam}}
Islam generally stresses orthopraxy over orthodoxy, but since the practice is held to come from doctrine, this is essentially orthodoxy applied to practice.

==Jainism==
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|100px|thumb|left|[[Karma in Jainism|Karma]] as [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness.]]
{{See also|Jain philosophy}}
[[Jain]] orthopraxy is based on two factors: [[Jain philosophy|Jain siddhanta]] (teachings of the [[Tirthankara]]) and ''kriya'' (practices prevalent at the time of the Tirthankaras). According to Jains, the Tirthankaras based their teachings and philosophy after knowing the realities on this universe (like ''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]'' and ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]''). Based on these realities, they propounded true and eternal principles like ''ahimsa'', truth, karma etc. that govern the universe. Jain rituals were codified on the basis of these principles to give effect to the teachings of the Tirthankaras.

==Judaism==
[[Image:OUKosher.JPG|thumb|175px|''The logo of a circle with a 'U' inside it (called: "O U")'' indicates this product is certified as [[kosher]] by the [[Orthodox Union]]. &lt;!-- ''[[Pareve]]'' indicates that this product contains neither milk nor meat derived ingredients. --&gt;]]
[[Judaism]] attaches primary importance to the practice of the ''[[mitzvot]]'', and that each act of daily life comply with the ethical and ritual teachings of the [[Torah]]. However, these gestures are intended to be motivated by the system of values and ethics of which they are a part, so that orthodoxy is not seen as simply a way of thinking according to established dogmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dubov|first1=Nissan Dovid|title=Doing or Understanding - Which Comes First?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/108401/jewish/Doing-or-Understanding.htm|website=chabad.org|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shema1j.ogg|thumb|left|Shema Yisrael (שמע ישראל) Recitation]]
Moreover, [[Maimonides]] codifies his [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 principles of faith]] as a binding theological dogma, and according to Maimonides some laws of the [[Torah]] require the acceptance of certain basic beliefs, such as the first and second positive commandments in Maimonides' [[Sefer Hamitzvot]], which mandate the belief in God and his indivisible unity, or the recitation of the [[Shema]]. Maimonides' codification of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] even contains a section entitled ''Yesodei HaTorah'' which delineates the required beliefs of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maimonides|first1=Moses|title=Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904959/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And yet, there is a small group of Jews in the orthodox world who argue that the nature of Judaism is orthoprax, such as [[Jeffrey Radon]], a teacher of Jewish studies who has an internet site Orthoprax Judaism devoted to Jewish studies in a democratic spirit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthopraxjudaism.com|title=Home Page - Orthoprax Judaism|author=|date=|website=Orthoprax Judaism|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel Drazin]], a former army chaplain and [[rabbi]] who recently came out in support of the idea that the nature of Judaism is orthoprax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksnthoughts.com/the-torah-requires-orthopraxy-not-orthodoxy/|title=The Torah requires orthopraxy not orthodoxy|author=|date=|website=booksnthoughts.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon argues that Maimonides codification of principles of belief as a binding theological dogma was not only an innovation but a distortion of the ancient Jewish tradition based upon the Bible and the Talmud (and that Maimonides was aware that his codification of a binding dogma was a distortion, and he codified such a dogma only for the unlearned Jewish masses to strengthen them as Christians and Muslims had codified such dogma) as there is no binding theological dogma in the Bible or in the Talmudic literature (and fundamental beliefs of the Bible or Talmudic literature do not have the status of binding dogma), and the commandments of the Torah as the basis of Jewish law are according to Jewish tradition commandments of doing and not doing (and not of believing or not believing).

==Neopaganism==
[[British Traditional Wicca]] is highly orthopraxic, with "traditions" (as denominations in [[Wicca]] are called) being precisely that—defined by what is traditionally done, rather than shared beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;SilverWitch, Sylvana (1995). [https://web.archive.org/web/20010412195549/http://widdershins.org/vol1iss3/l03.htm "A Witch in the Halls of Wisdom: Northwest Legend Fritz Muntean Discusses School, Theology, and the Craft"], in ''Widdershins'' Vol. 1, Issue 3 (Lammas 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Modern Paganism|Neopagans]] may or may not share this quality, as noted by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], who draws a distinction between "Religious Neo-Pagans" and "God/dess Celebrants." Lewis states the majority of the Neopagan movement is strongly opposed to Religionist traditions that incorporate any form of orthopraxy or orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first= James R. |title=Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1996 |pages=84–85 |isbn=978-0-7914-2889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many Neopagan organizations, when discussing orthopraxy, limit themselves solely to ritualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf.org/articles/cosmology/discussing-pagan-theology.html |title=Discussing Pagan Theology |accessdate=September 10, 2008 |author=Corrigan, Ian |publisher=[[Ár nDraíocht Féin]] (A Druid Fellowship) |quote=''The pagan religion was about orthopraxy, doing the customs correctly.

==Polytheistic Reconstructionism==
{{See also|Polytheistic Reconstructionism}}
Reconstructionist religions make full use of orthopraxy, defining their practices as a lifestyle, and identifying correct action as living life in accord with specific ideals and principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asatru.org/ |title=Answers about Asatru  |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Asatru Alliance]] |quote=''Proper behavior in Asatru consists of maximizing one's virtues and minimizing one's vices.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Introduction to Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism |url=http://paganachd.com/faq/ethics.html |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |publisher=Paganachd |quote=''(Celtic Recostructionism is) grounded in traditional Celtic virtues which should be embraced, adopted, and integrated into one’s daily life.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioromana.net/about.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20031204235941/http://www.religioromana.net/about.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 4, 2003 |title=About the Religio Romana |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |publisher=Temple of Religio Romana |quote=''We have included the ancient Roman Virtues as an accompaniment to spiritual practice as we feel that they are conducive to the fulfillment of one's higher self.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?f=faq&amp;type=english |title=Frequently asked questions about the Hellenic religion and tradition |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes |quote=''We do not just strive for a superficial return to the 'ancient ways', but on the contrary, for the return of a different kind of person, Hellenic Man, who will be governed by humanistic values, as were first expressed and exhibited by our ancestors.

A '''pivot language''', sometimes also called a '''bridge language''', is an [[artificial language|artificial]] or [[natural language]] used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the [[combinatorial explosion (communication)|combinatorial explosion]] of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;), rather than quadratic &lt;math&gt;\left(\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}}=\frac{n^2-n}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.

The disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when [[Hernán Cortés]] communicated with [[Mesoamerican]] Indians, he would speak Spanish to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who would speak [[Mayan language|Mayan]] to [[Malintzin]], who would speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] to the locals.

== Examples ==
{{See also|Interlingual machine translation}}
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are often used as pivot languages.  [[Interlingua]] has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Linguaphobos? Non in le UE". [Linguaphobes? Not in the EU]. ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 2006, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Esperanto]] was proposed as a pivot language in the [[Distributed Language Translation]] project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website [http://www.majstro.com/ Majstro.com].  The [[Universal Networking Language]] is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.

== In computing ==
{{see also|Intermediate language|Data conversion#Pivotal conversion}}
Pivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems.  For example, the [[internet protocol]], [[XML]] and [[high level language]]s are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.

[[Unicode]] was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.

== In machine translation (MT) ==
Current statistical machine translation ([[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]) systems use [[parallel corpora]] for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.

Pivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p &amp; p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation ([[RBMT]]) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.

Three basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) ''triangulation'', which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) ''[[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer]]'', which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) ''synthesis'', which builds a corpus of its own for system training.

The '''triangulation''' method (also called ''phrase table multiplication'') calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The '''transfer''' method (also called ''sentence translation strategy'') simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The '''synthetic''' method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.

A direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.

All three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the ''synthetic'' technique  doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.

The key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">A '''proverbial phrase''' or a '''proverbial expression''' is type of a conventional [[saying]] similar to [[proverb]]s and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed [[Expression (language)|expression]], while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S.

Another similar construction is an [[idiom]]atic phrase. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a distinction between idiomatic phrase and proverbial expression. In both of them the meaning does not immediately follow from the phrase. The difference is that an idiomatic phrase involves [[figurative language]] in its components, while in a proverbial phrase the figurative meaning is the extension of its [[literal meaning]]. Some experts  classify proverbs and proverbial phrases as types of [[idiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicography: Critical Concepts (2003) R. R. K.

A '''rite''' is an established, [[Ceremony|ceremonial]], usually [[religious]], act. Rites in this sense fall into three major categories:
* [[rites of passage]], generally changing an individual's social status, such as [[marriage]], [[adoption]], [[baptism]], [[coming of age]], [[graduation]], or [[inauguration]];
* [[ritual|communal rites]], whether of [[worship]], where a community comes together to worship, such as [[Jew]]ish [[synagogue]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], or of another character, such as [[fertility rite]]s and certain non-religious [[festival]]s;
* rites of personal devotion, where an individual worships, including prayer and [[pilgrimage]]s such as the [[Muslim]] [[Hajj]], [[pledge of allegiance|pledges of allegiance]], or [[engagement|promises to wed someone]].

==Christianity==
{{main article|Christian liturgy}}

===Catholicism and Orthodoxy===
{{Main|Christian liturgy|Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites#Rites}}
Within the Catholic Church, "rite" often refers to what is also called a [[sacrament]] and respective liturgies based on liturgical languages and traditional local customs as well as the ceremonies associated with the sacraments. In Christian Catholicism, for example, the sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]]/[[Last Rites]] is one of the sacramental rites because they are administered to someone who is or was dying. The other are [[Penance#Sacramental penance|Penance]] and [[Eucharist]] (administered as [[Viaticum]] in the case of a dying person). Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], anointing of the sick is administered to those who are seriously ill but not necessarily in immediate danger of death. Another example is the [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Catholic/2005/04/What-Are-The-Last-Rites.aspx What Are the Last Rites?]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "rite" became widely used after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. While "rite" is often associated when receiving  a "sacrament," it is technically incorrect to say that one received a "rite" because the sacrament is what is received while a rite is performed. The ritual consists of the prayers and actions that the minister of the sacrament performs when administering a sacrament. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that one has received "the last rites" as that person has really received "the last sacraments" by a minister following a ritual that has performed the "sacramental rite."

Within both Catholicism and Orthodoxy, the term "rite" also refers to a body of [[Christian liturgy|liturgical tradition]] usually emanating from a specific center. Examples include the [[Roman Rite]], the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the [[Sarum Rite]]. Such rites may include various sub-rites. For example, the Byzantine Rite has Greek, Russian, and other ethnically-based variants.

In addition, the same term is applied to an autonomous [[particular Church]] within the [[Catholic Church]] associated with a particular liturgical tradition.  Of these, the largest is the [[Latin Rite]] or Western Church. There are also several [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which are the same catholic Church with distinct rites.

===Protestantism===

Within many Protestant Christian denominations, the word rite is used for important ceremonies that are not considered [[sacraments]] or [[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinances]]. The [[39 Articles]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] of the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist Church]] state "there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, [[Baptism]] and the [[Holy Communion|Supper of the Lord]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article XXV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Articles of Religion (Methodist)]], Article XVI&lt;/ref&gt; As such, in the Anglican and Methodist traditions, the following are considered rites: "[[confirmation]], [[confession (religion)|reconciliation]] (confessions of sins), [[Christian views on marriage|matrimony]], [[holy orders]] and [[anointing of the sick]]".&lt;ref name="Lonsdale2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lonsdale|first=Akasha|title=Do I Kneel or Do I Bow?: What You Need To Know When Attending Religious Occasions|date=2010 |publisher=Kuperard|language=English|isbn=9781857335347|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the "rites of the [[Moravian Church]] are Confirmation, Marriage, and Ordination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravian.org/faith-a-congregations/rites-and-sacraments/|title=Rites and Sacraments of the Moravian Church|year=2000|publisher=Moravian Church of North America|language=English|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lutheran]] tradition, Holy Baptism, [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Holy Eucharist]], and [[Confession (Lutheran Church)|Confession &amp; Absolution]] are considered [[Lutheran sacraments]], while [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|Confirmation]], Anointing of the Sick, Holy Matrimony, and [[Holy Orders]] are rites.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=Ronald J.|title=Religion in North America|year=1984|publisher=Wm.

Although the earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897,&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Relations'']; retrieved 2011-05-17&lt;/ref&gt; the four largest populations of Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants live in [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Peru]].

===American ''Sansei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}} 
The majority of American ''Sansei'' were born during the [[Baby Boom]] after the end of [[World War II]]; but older ''Sansei'' who were living in the western United States during WWII were forcibly interned with their parents (''Nisei'') and grandparents (''[[Issei]]'') after [[Executive Order 9066]] was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from large parts of the Western states.  The '' Sansei'' were forceful activists in the redress movement, which resulted in an official apology to the internees.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas. (1981). [https://books.google.com/books?id=m60q57zoReUC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=sansei&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U2GHKKafchXxMXEcYSTGJ3D6n5qTw  ''Ethnic America: A History,'' p. 176.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In some senses, the ''Sansei'' seem to feel they are caught in a dilemma between their "quiet" Nisei parents and their other identity model of "verbal" Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi, Nobu. (1978).

In the United States, a representative ''Sansei'' is General [[Eric Shinseki]] (born November 28, 1942), the 34th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] (1999–2003) and former  [[United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]. He is the first [[Asian American]] in U.S. history to be a [[four-star general]], and the first to lead one of the four U.S. military services.&lt;ref&gt;Zweigenhaft, Richard L. ''et al.''

Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"&gt;McLellan, Janet.

== Cultural profile ==

=== Generations ===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numbers]] corresponding to the [[generation]] with the Japanese word for generation (''sei'' 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (四世) and the fifth is called ''Gosei'' (五世).  The ''Issei'', ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, religious belief and practice and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, {{Google books|NMm024458s4C|p. 59.|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"/&gt;  
The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese American National Museum, [http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] retrieved 2011-05-17&lt;/ref&gt;   The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left.  These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, {{Google books|NMm024458s4C|p. 37.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

|}

In North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.  The ''Sansei'', their parents, their grandparents, and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, {{Google books|NMm024458s4C|p. 68.|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]; but unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as ''Issei'', ''Nisei'' or ''Sansei''.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, Keiko. (2001). {{Google books|VBijCPLvWyUC|''The Japanese Community in Pre-War Britain: From Integration to Disintegration,''  p. 7.|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sansei====
The third generation of immigrants, born in the United States or Canada to parents born in the United States or Canada, is called ''Sansei'' (三世). Children born to the ''Nisei'' were generally born after 1945. They speak English as their first language and are completely acculturized in the contexts of Canadian or American society. They tend to identify with Canadian or American values, norms and expectations. Few speak Japanese and most tend to express their identity as Canadian or American rather than Japanese. Among the ''Sansei'' there is an overwhelming percentage of marriages to persons of non-Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"/&gt;

====Aging====
The ''[[kanreki]]'' (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei'' and a few ''Sansei''. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values and this  Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Mary L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/mm006n8332478691/  "A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday."] ''Journal	Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology.''

Some responded to internment with lawsuits and political action; and for others, poetry became an unplanned consequence:

The numbers of ''sansei'' who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the ''Nikkei.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Botticelli - Adoration of the Magi (Zanobi Altar) - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' has an inserted self-portrait at the far right: the position in the corner and the gaze out to the viewer are very typical of such self-portraits.]]
'''Self-insertion''' is a literary device in which a [[fictional character]], who represents the real author of a work of fiction, appears as an idealized character within that fiction, either overtly or in disguise.&lt;ref name="Goetz2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goetz|first=Sharon K.|title=Terminus: Collected Papers on Harry Potter, 7-11 August 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nffbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA516|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780982680704|pages=516–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the equivalent is the '''inserted self-portrait''', where the artist includes a [[self-portrait]] in a painting of a narrative subject. This has been a common artistic device since at least the [[European Renaissance]].

==Related concepts==
This literary device should not be confused with a [[first-person narrator]], an [[author surrogate]], or a character somewhat based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as ''unintentional'' self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In [[literature]], a '''serial''' is a printing format by which a single larger [[Work of art|work]], often a work of [[Narrative|narrative fiction]], is published in smaller, sequential ''installments''. The installments are also known as ''numbers'', ''parts'' or ''fascicles'', and may be released either as separate [[Publication|publications]] or within sequential issues of a [[periodical publication]], such as a magazine or newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism|last1= Law|first1= Graham|editor1-first= Laurel|editor1-last= Brake|editor2-first= Marysa|editor2-last= Demoor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover|chapter= Serials and the Nineteenth-Century Publishing Industry|year= 2009|publisher= Academia Press|location= London|isbn= |page= 567|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA567|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' and ''[[Artamène|Le Grand Cyrus]]''. At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost installments called fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Roger|title=Technology and Economic Exploitation: The Serial as a Form of Narrative Presentation|journal=Wide Angle: A Film Quarterly of Theory, Criticism and Practice|year=1988|volume=10|issue=4|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th and early 20th centuries ==
Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's [[Victorian era]], due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book |title= Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press |last= Law |first= Graham |year= 2000 |publisher= Palgrave |location= New York &amp; Hampshire, UK |isbn= 0-312-23574-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=serial+fiction+victorian+graham+law&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vF6kToWdEqXo0QHN9oSfBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serial%20fiction%20victorian%20graham%20law&amp;f=false | accessdate= October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} Most [[Victorian novels]] first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|13}} The wild success of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature.  During that era, the line between "quality" and "commercial" literature was not distinct.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|31}} Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were [[Wilkie Collins]], inventor of the [[detective fiction|detective novel]] with ''[[The Moonstone]]'' and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who created the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories originally for serialization in ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]'' magazine.

While American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format.&lt;ref name=Lund&gt;{{cite book |title= AMERICAS CONTINUING STORY An Introduction to Serial Fiction, 1850-1900 |last= Lund |first= Michael |year= 1993 |publisher= Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn= 0-8143-2401-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=serialized+fiction+victorian+&amp;ots=VywkLjckG4&amp;sig=XUtZjmFc3-LidHeTA8yBNt6UYRI#v=onepage
| accessdate= October 23, 2011}} As [[Scribner's Monthly]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} As a piece in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' explained in 1878, "Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first."&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|52}} Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were [[Henry James]] and [[Herman Melville]]. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], which was published over a 40-week period by ''[[The National Era]]'', an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue.

Serialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|30}} The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;

In France, [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Eugène Sue]] were masters of the serialized genre. ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' each appeared as a ''[[feuilleton]]''. ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' was stretched out to 139 installments. Eugène Sue's serial novel ''Le Juif errant'' increased circulation of ''Le Constitutionnel'' from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' was serialized in ''[[La Revue de Paris]]'' in 1856.

Some writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. [[Wilkie Collins]], for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German-speaking countries]], the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875.&lt;ref name = Belgum1&gt;Kirsten Belgum: "Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube" in: ''Women in German Yearbook 9'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-8032-9754-8}} pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'' serialized [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' from 1873 to 1877 and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] wrote several serialized novels: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (1885–86), ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1887–89), ''[[The New Woman]]'' (1890–93), and his sole [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894–95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895–96).

In addition, works in late [[Qing dynasty]] China had been serialized. ''[[The Nine-tailed Turtle]]'' was serialized from 1906 to 1910.&lt;ref name=WangDeweip181&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David Der-wei]].

== Late 20th and early-21st centuries ==
With the rise of broadcast—both radio and [[television series]]—in the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success.

The first several books in the ''[[Tales of the City]]'' series by [[Armistead Maupin]] appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as ''[[The Serial]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/marin_a_and_e/book_reviews/article_3f9b2c1e-65b4-11e2-9dd9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=That '70s book|publisher=Pacific Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976; [[Marin County]]), ''Tangled Lives'' (Boston), ''Bagtime'' (Chicago), and ''Federal Triangle'' (Washington, D.C.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915212,00.html |title=The Press: Soap Operas Come to Print |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 8, 1977 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1984, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ragen|first=Brian Abel|title=Tom Wolfe: A Critical Companion|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT:|isbn=0-313-31383-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander McCall Smith]], author of ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel ''[[44 Scotland Street]]'' in instalments every weekday in ''[[The Scotsman]]''. [[Michael Chabon]] serialized ''[[Gentlemen of the Road]]'' in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 2007.

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] prompted some authors to revise a serial format. [[Stephen King]] experimented with ''[[The Plant]]'' (2000), and [[Michel Faber]] allowed ''The Guardian'' to serialise his novel ''[[The Crimson Petal and the White]]''. In 2005, [[Orson Scott Card]] serialized his out-of-print novel ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' in the first issue of his online magazine, ''[[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''. In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel ''[[Corduroy Mansions]]'', with the audio edition read by [[Andrew Sachs]] made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, [[pseudonym]]ous author Wildbow published ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'', which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time.&lt;ref name="Beacon-Villager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/article/20150702/NEWS/150709367|title=Adam Sherman of Maynard publishes web serial|first=Jesse|last=Collings|publisher=Wicked Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/online-exclusive/reading-revolution/2014/02/20/discipline-and-determiniation/|title=Discipline and determination pay off for webserial writer|date=20 February 2014|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow|title=Wildbow is creating Web serials|publisher=[[Patreon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[fan fiction]] on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as [[FanFiction.Net]] and [[Archive of Our Own#Archive of Our Own|Archive of Our Own (AO3)]].

Many aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as [[LiveJournal]], Fictionpress.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fictionpress.com Fictionpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; fictionhub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionhub.io|title = fictionhub|date = |accessdate = |website = fictionhub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wattpad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattpad.com Wattpad]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Many Books Do You Need To Sell To Become A Bestseller?|url=http://www.bookpromotionhub.com/6103/how-many-books-do-you-need-to-sell-to-become-a-bestseller/|website=www.bookpromotionhub.com|publisher=book promotion hub|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/monthly-views-june.jpg|website=wildbow.wordpress.com|title=Thoughts: A Reflection on growth over two years|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jukepopserials.com/ JukePop Serials]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Serial Box&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/6/16849756/serial-box-serialized-books-peak-tv|title=Meet a new kind of book, designed for the age of Peak TV|work=Vox|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serialbox.com/|title=Serial Box is the Newest Medium for Series Drama|website=www.serialbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with iOS&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-serial-stories-jukepop/id579377848?mt=8 JukePop Serials] (iOS)&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jukepop&amp;hl=en JukePop Serials] (Android)&lt;/ref&gt; apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.

'''''South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book analyzing the [[philosophy]] and [[popular culture]] effects of ''[[South Park]]'', published by Open Court.  The book is edited by [[Richard Hanley]].

In an interview about the book, Richard Hanley explained why he chose the topic of ''South Park'' for philosophical analysis: "''South Park'' is like the ''Simpsons'', but with a lot less restrictions, and almost every episode pushes the envelope."&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Auxier also gave a talk on his contribution to the work, at [[Green Mountain College]].&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;  ''South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating'' also addresses issues of [[applied ethics]], such as [[stem-cell research]], [[euthanasia]], [[Doping (sport)|drugs in sports]], [[religion]], [[blasphemy]], [[human evolution]], [[Environmentalism|environment]], and [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;  The book is organized into five sections by topic, which include "Religion and Other Disabilities", "Politics and Other Sacred Cows", "Morality and Other Urges", "Science, Logic and Other Really, Really Clever Stuff" and "Humor and Other Insertable Devices".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Jerry Rhodes noted in an interview published in the [[University of Delaware]]'s ''UDaily'' that Hanley's work celebrates the ability of ''South Park'' to confront issues that make most viewers uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;  Victor Greto wrote in ''The News Journal'', that though some of the humor in the book "falls flat", most readers will laugh out loud, but also squirm a bit.&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt;  Greto went on to note the book's proclivity towards certain racial epithets and language, as well as a critique of religion.&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt; Religions analyzed in the work include [[Scientology]] and the [[Xenu]] mythology, as presented in the ''South Park'' episode, [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], which Hanley discusses in comparison to elements of [[Christianity]] and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt;

Ginsburg]] defined the term in 1995.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Globally, women are confined to different societal standards on reproduction. The ability to choose whether women want to become pregnant is not available to all women. [[Contraception]] and [[abortion]]s can be illegal or difficult to obtain depending on location or [[socioeconomic status]]. Women’s experience of child birth has varied from required minimum number of children a mother must birth and honors for overachieving the set minimums to a restricted the number of children per household. In a broader sense, stratified reproduction asserts that certain categories of people are encouraged and coerced to reproduced while others are systematically discouraged to do so. The capacity to control one's reproductive choices is unequally distributed among race, sexual orientation, gender, class and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, M., Dirks, D. &amp; Aseltine, E. (2009). Stratified reproduction. In J. O'Brien (Ed.), Encyclopedia of gender and society (pp. 812-814). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412964517.n406&lt;/ref&gt; Stratified reproduction also extends beyond the aspect of reproduction to the extent of conception, contraception, prenatal medical care, childcare, and the mother’s role in their child’s life.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, Faye D. and Rayna Rapp, ed. 1995 Conceiving the New World Order.  London, England: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

 In 1984, Shellee Colen coined the term "stratified reproduction" when studying West Indian childcare workers in New York City, who typically worked for wealthier white families. Colen highlighted differences between white and West Indian mothers’ ability to choose how they each care for their children. The white mothers hire a nanny to carry out the routine tasks of childcare while the West Indian mothers forgo the ability to raise their children so that they can financially support them. Colen drew the conclusion that child birth and childcare is experienced, valued, and rewarded differently depending on a mother’s socioeconomic status and availability of resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Studies using the concept ==
Since the emergence of the term stratified reproduction, researchers have applied its concepts to analyze the different effects of varying social factors on reproduction and childcare. [[Rayna Rapp]] and [[Faye Ginsburg|Frye D. Ginsburg]] pioneered the application of stratified reproduction to different societies to emphasize the variation to which women experienced reproduction and childcare. In Rapp and Ginsburg’s book, ''Conceiving'' ''the New World Order: The Global politics of Reproduction'', they discuss several societies that limited women’s choice on reproduction and childcare due to socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30896173|title=Conceiving the new world order : the global politics of reproduction|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|others=Ginsburg, Faye D., Reiter, Rayna R.|isbn=9780520089143|location=Berkeley|oclc=30896173}}&lt;/ref&gt; They touch on Shellee Colen’s research on West Indian nannies in New York and how they are unable to participate in their own child’s childcare, because they must immigrate to America to find work to support their family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also include Gail Kligman’s research on abortion bans in [[Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceausescu]]’s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/789661646|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|others=Brettell, Caroline., Sargent, Carolyn F., 1947-|year=|isbn=9780205247288|location=Boston|pages=374–384|oclc=789661646}}&lt;/ref&gt; State policy required the Romanian women to birth at least four children in hopes of increasing the population for a more efficient socialist country. They also discuss China’s limit on the maximum number of children per household, and low-income African American women’s struggle to obtain proper contraceptives and abortions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rapp and Ginsburg concluded that “global and local socioeconomic relations that form the context for stratified reproduction, whereby ‘some categories of people are empowered to nurture and reproduce, while others are disempowered’”, and that cultural ideologies and state policies reinforce the stratified reproduction implanted by socioeconomic factors.

The scope of use of the stratified reproduction framework is not limited to women’s access to contraceptives or lack thereof. Researchers are applying stratified reproduction to the health of the mothers and children. Infertility has also been linked to the effects of stratified reproduction. Scarce financial resources deters mothers from being able to reach effective medical services to help prevent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greil|first=Arthur L.|last2=McQuillan|first2=Julia|last3=Shreffler|first3=Karina M.|last4=Johnson|first4=Katherine M.|last5=Slauson-Blevins|first5=Kathleen S.|title=Race-Ethnicity and Medical Services for Infertility|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=493–509|doi=10.1177/0022146511418236|pmid=22031500|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infertility ==
Infertility is just one aspect of stratified reproduction. Although it is estimated that 186 million people worldwide are affected by infertility, technology can be able to assist those who are infertile.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inhorn|first=M. C.|last2=Patrizio|first2=P.|date=2015-03-22|title=Infertility around the globe: new thinking on gender, reproductive technologies and global movements in the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/21/4/411/683746|journal=Human Reproduction Update|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=411–426|issn=1355-4786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-Vitro-Fertilization (IVF) is one assisted reproductive technique (ART) that is used. IVF was developed over 30 years ago to help women with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes. IVF has helped many couples achieve their dreams of having a child. However, IVF is extremely expensive and/or inaccessible to many globally. In Central and Southern Africa "two-thirds of infertile women have diagnoses of tubal blockage attributable to sterilizing RTIs [Reproductive Tract Infections]" which is exactly what IVF was developed for.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inhorn|first=Marcia C.|date=2009-06-18|title=Right to assisted reproductive technology: Overcoming infertility in low-resource countries|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=106|issue=2|pages=172–174|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.03.034|pmid=19539927|issn=0020-7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high costs and inaccessibility keep infertility as a major aspect of stratified reproduction. According to a study done by Marcia C. Inhorn and Pasquale Patrizio, regions such as South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia have high infertility rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While infertility is a global phenomenon, other issues within those regions play a role in their high infertility rates.

Secondary infertility, being unable to conceive after a previous pregnancy, is the most common form of infertility in women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Typically secondary infertility comes from RTIs. In countries where abortions are illegal, women will choose to have unsafe abortions. These unsafe abortions can lead to RTIs and secondary infertility if left untreated. Studies show that in places where laws are lifting the ban on abortions, secondary infertility rates are decreasing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Ethnicity and race also play a role in infertility. Recently, the stories of Latinas' struggle for reproductive rights have been coming out. These stories provided evidence that the US was funding forced sterilization of Latinas and other ethnic groups. In their article, Elena R. Gutiérrez and Liza Fuentes study two communities, Puerto Rican women in Puerto Rico and New York and Mexican-origin women in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|date=|title=Population Control by Sterilization|url=https://www.albany.edu/celac/LRR%202010.pdf#page=87|journal=Latino (a) Research Review|volume=7|issue=3|pages=85–100|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Puerto Rico became a US colony in 1898, people began to talk about Puerto Rico being overpopulated. To deal with this a large portion, over 34% of mothers aged 20–49, were sterilized. Not all women chose to be sterilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many of these women were used for contraceptive testing without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Mexican-origin women were another community that experiences forced sterilization. They were non consensual sterilizations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These sterilizations came from the idea that Latinas are over-populating the US.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In his article, Leo Chavez discusses Latina fertility in the United States. Their ethnic identity drove a new set of advertisements, anti-immigration advertisements.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chavez|first=Leo|date=Summer 2004|title=A Glass Half Empty: Latina Reproduction and Public Discourse|jstor=44127294|journal=Human Organization|volume=63|issue=2|pages=173–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advertisements suggest that the Latina communities leave. That their fertility was not wanted in the US, a country where the population growth rate was near zero.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Puerto Ricans such as those discussed in the article by Gutiérrez and Fuentes were apart of this larger Latina community that was being targeted. In Leo Chavez's article, he collects data to discuss fertility rates in Latinas. He uses this data to show that while Latinas are having more children, they are not started at a younger age as the US would like to believe.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Queer Stratified Reproduction ==
More recently, there has been a closer look into how the system of stratified reproduction impacts the LGBTQ+ community. Stratified reproduction within the reproductive field of medicine feeds into a political economy that does not include a right to health, but a right to purchase health care if one can afford it and is deemed worthy of these biomedicines. States such as Arizona and Mississippi have recently seen legislative attempts to allow health care services to deny care to LGBTQ people and these stratifications of access to care  also denies LGBTQ people the same possibilities for family planning and formation.&lt;ref&gt;Greil, A. L., McQuillan, J., Shreffler, K. M., Johnson, K. M., &amp; Slauson-Blevins, K. S. (2011). Race-Ethnicity and Medical Services for Infertility: Stratified Reproduction in a Population-based Sample of U.S. Women. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 52(4), 493–509. https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146511418236&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">'''Terministic screen''' is a term in the theory and criticism of [[rhetoric]]. It involves the acknowledgment of a language system that determines an individual's perception and symbolic action in the world.

==Overview==
[[Kenneth Burke]] develops the terministic screen in his book of essays called ''[[Language as Symbolic Action]]'' in 1966. He defines the concept as "a screen composed of terms through which humans perceive the world, and that direct attention away from some interpretations and toward others".&lt;ref&gt;Stob, Paul. " 'Terministic Screens', Social Constructionism, and the Language of Experience: Kenneth Burke's Utilization of William James". Philosophy and Rhetoric 42, no. 2 (May 1, 2008): 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke offers the metaphor to explain why people interpret messages differently, based on the construction of symbols, meanings, and, therefore, reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Terministic Screens". In Language as Symbolic Action, 45. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Words convey a particular meaning, conjuring images and ideas that induce support toward beliefs or opinions. Receivers interpret the intended message through a metaphorical screen of their own vocabulary and perspective to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blakesley, David, ed. The Terministic Screen: Rhetorical Perspectives on Film. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain terms may grab attention and lead to a particular conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Palczewski, Catherine Helen, Richard Ice, and John Fritch. "Terministic Screen." In Rhetoric in Civic Life, 39. State College, PA: Strata Publishing, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "Language reflects, selects, and deflects as a way of shaping the symbol systems that allow us to cope with the world".{{sfn|Stob|p=139}} Every word chosen says something about the society we live in. The language we choose to use will be a representation of our reality, our world, our culture, and our beliefs, even without intention.

== Scientistic versus dramatistic ==
Burke describes two different types of terministic screens: scientistic and dramatistic. Scientistic begins with a definition of a term; it describes the term as what it is or what it is not, putting the term in black and white. When defining, the essential function is either attitudinal or hortatory. In other words, the focus is on expressions or commands. When terms are treated as hortatory, they are developed. Burke comments on why he uses developed rather than another word. "I say 'developed'; I do not say 'originating'. The ultimate origins of language seem to me as mysterious as the origins of the universe itself. One must view it, I feel, simply as the 'given' ". {{sfn|Burke|p=44}} The dramatistic approach concerns action: thou shalt or thou shalt not.{{sfn|Burke|p=45}} This screen directs the audience toward action based on interpretation of a term. Via terministic screens, the audience will be able to associate with the term or dissociate from it.{{sfn|Burke|p=49}}

== Social constructionism ==
"[[Social constructionism]] is a metaphor that attempts to capture the way Burke viewed the nature of the world and the function of language therein." Symbols, terms, and language build our view of life. Social constructionism allows us to look at Burke's theory in terms we recognize and are comfortable with. {{sfn|Stob|p=131}}

== Examples ==
When a person says gender, most people, based on their individual beliefs, normally think of male or female. However, some could think of intersex individuals. If someone says they think of male, female, and intersex, more would be reflected about the person based on their terminology. Still others would recognize gender as different from biological sex, and say they think of man, woman, and other genders. Another example occurs within the abortion controversy. A pro-choice advocate would most likely use the word "fetus" but pro-life advocates would use the word "baby", because the term stirs more realistic and relatable images and has a bearing on the legal status. Using the word "baby" versus "fetus" defines reality differently (scientistic) and guides people to act in a certain way (dramatistic) solely based on term selection that may be unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ian. " 'The Human Barnyard' and Kenneth Burke's Philosophy of Technology". KB Journal 5, no. 2 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Words are absolute for thought and action.{{sfn|Palczewski, Ice, and Fritch|p=39}} According to Burke, individuals create terministic screens consciously and unconsciously, as they perceive the world and share perspectives.  Burke contends these screens set up a network of beliefs through which all ideas will be interpreted. Communication scholar Paul Stob contends that the language we use is thus not just a direct reflection of our intelligence, but also of perception and culture.  David Blakesley posits that the terministic screen enables the further understanding of rhetorical perspectives. In each of these ways, the terministic screen allows for concepts to be interpreted in different ways by different people and contribute to the complexity of meaning.

The group, comprising critical gender, feminist, and queer scholars, formed to tackle "neurosexism"&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt; as defined by [[Cordelia Fine]] in her 2010 book ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'' "uncritical biases in [neuroscientific] research and public perception, and their societal impacts on an individual, structural, and symbolic level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fine | first = Cordelia | author-link = Cordelia Fine | title = Delusions of gender: how our minds, society, and neurosexism create difference | publisher = W.W.

By contrast they practice "neurofeminism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bluhm | first1 = Robyn | last2 = Maibom | first2 = Heidi Lene | last3 = Jaap Jacobson | first3 = Anne | author-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780230296732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to critically evaluate [[heteronormative]] assumptions of contemporary brain research and examine the impact and cultural significance of neuroscientific research on society's views about gender.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kaiser | first1 = Anelis | last2 = Dussauge | first2 = Isabelle | author-link1 = Anelis Kaiser | author-link2 = Isabelle Dussauge | contribution = Re-queering the brain | editor-last1 = Bluhm | editor-first1 = Robyn | editor-last2 = Jacobson | editor-first2 = Anne Jaap | editor-last3 = Maibom | editor-first3 = Heidi Lene | editor-link1 = Robyn Bluhm | title = Neurofeminism: issues at the intersection of feminist theory and cognitive science | pages = 121&amp;ndash;144 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Hampshire New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781349333929 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network advocate greater emphasis to be placed on [[neuroplasticity]] rather than biological determinism.&lt;ref name="Schmitz_Höppner_Frontiers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vidal | first1 = Catherine | title = The sexed brain: between science and ideology | journal = Neuroethics, Special Issue: Neuroscience and Sex/Gender | volume = 5 | issue =  3 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-011-9121-9 | date = December 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debates ==
=== Sex differences in human neonatal social perception ===
Non-network member, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], conducted a test on newborns – on average a day-and-a-half old – to see if they were more interested a human face (social object) or a mobile (physical-mechanical object). Baron-Cohen concluded that the results, based on the eye-gaze of the babies, "showed that the male infants showed a stronger interest in the physical-mechanical mobile while the female infants showed a stronger interest in the face" and the "research clearly demonstrates that sex differences are in part biological in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connellan | first1 = Jennifer | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Wheelwright | first3 = Sally | last4 = Batkia | first4 = Anna | last5 = Ahluwaliab | first5 = Jag | author-link2 = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Sex differences in human neonatal social perception | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;119 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-6383(00)00032-1 | date = January 2000 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.627.1904 }}

Network member, [[Cordelia Fine]], criticized the experiment as being flawed for a number of reasons including: the expectations of the experimenter (graduate student, Jennifer Connellan), for example, unconsciously moving her head more / smiling more for a female baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nash | first1 = Alison | last2 = Grossi | first2 = Giordana | author-link2 = Giordana Grossi | title = Picking Barbie™'s brain: inherent sex differences in scientific ability? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary Feminist Thought, Special Issue: Women and Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 29&amp;ndash;42 | date = 2007 | url =  http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/jift/vol2/iss1/5  | ref = harv }} [https://faculty.newpaltz.edu/giordanagrossi/files/NashGrossi2007.pdf Pdf.]

Norton &amp; Company | page = 84 | location = New York | isbn = 9780393068382| title-link = Delusions of Gender }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Fine's book Baron-Cohen "we included a panel of independent judges coding the videotapes of just the eye-region of the baby’s face, from which it is virtually impossible to judge the sex of the baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | title = Delusions of gender – 'neurosexism', biology and politics (book review) | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 904&amp;ndash;905 | date = November 2010 | url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-11/book-reviews | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Fine argued, "clearly, if the behaviour of the experimenter-cum-stimulus has already inadvertently influenced the babies’ eye gaze behaviour, the introduction of sex-blind judges is to close the stable door after the horse has bolted," and fellow network member [[Gina Rippon]] added, "the potential for misuse of our [neuroscientists] research should make us doubly careful of how (and why) we do research into these kinds of arenas, and how we report our findings. [...] Whether we like it or not, science and politics do mix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rippon | first1 = Gina | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | author-link1 = Gina Rippon | author-link2 = Cordelia Fine | title = Forum: Seductive arguments? | journal = [[The Psychologist (magazine)|The Psychologist]] | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 948&amp;ndash;949 | date = December 2010 | url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences when processing fear ===
In an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study into the gender differences when processing fear, Schienle ''et al.'' (who are not part of The NeuroGenderings Network) began with an hypothesis that women would show a greater emotional response than men. In fact, the results showed the opposite. The researchers' explanation for the unexpected response pattern was that it "may reflect greater attention from males to cues of aggression in their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schienle | first1 = Anne | last2 = Schäfer | first2 = Axel | last3 = Stark | first3 = Rudolf | last4 = Walter | first4 = Bertram | last5 = Vaitl | first5 = Dieter | title = Gender differences in the processing of disgust- and fear-inducing pictures: an fMRI study | journal = [[NeuroReport]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277&amp;ndash;280 | pmid = 15706235 | date = 28 February 2005 | url = http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2005/02280/Gender_differences_in_the_processing_of_disgust_.15.aspx | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network member [[Robyn Bluhm]] criticized the initial hypothesis, that women would show a greater emotional response than men, as stereotyping. She also criticized the researchers' explanation for the unexpected results, as they discounted the possibility that men may be more sensitive to fear than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Turk | first = Victoria | title = You can't just reduce neurological differences to "women can't read maps" | work = [[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] | url = https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvywam/how-neurosexism-feeds-stereotypes-about-mens-and-womens-brains | date = 28 November 2014 | access-date = 25 August 2017}}

=== Female brain / male brain versus "mosaics" of brain features ===
An article by Tracey Shors found "sex differences in emotional and cognitive responses in rats" and she advised that her findings "be used to better understand and promote mental health in humans" as "a greater appreciation of our [sex] differences can only enhance our ability to treat our common afflictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shors | first = Tracey J. | title = Opposite effects of stressful experience on memory formation in males versus females | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience, Special Issuel: CNS Aspects of Reproductive Endocrinology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 139&amp;ndash;147 | pmc = 3181678 | date = June 2002 | url = https://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/04/DialoguesClinNeurosci-4-139.pdf | ref = harv | pmid = 22033590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, the research carried out by network member [[Daphna Joel]] ''et al.'' found that "between 55% and 70% of people had a “mosaic” of gender characteristics, compared to less than one per cent who had only “masculine” or only “feminine” characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Joel | first1 = Daphna | last2 = Fine | first2 = Cordelia | author-link1 = Daphna Joel | author-link2 = Cordelia Fine | title = It's time to celebrate the fact that there are many ways to be male and female | work = [[The Guardian]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/brain-sex-many-ways-to-be-male-and-female | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 December 2015 | access-date = 26 August 2017}}

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

'''Tick-box culture''' is described as bureaucratic and external impositions on professional working conditions, which can be found in many organizations around the world.&lt;ref name="Cleland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cleland|first1=Jennifer|last2=Reeve|first2=Joanne|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Joe|last4=Johnston|first4=Peter|title=Resisting the tick box culture: refocusing medical education and training|journal=The British Journal of General Practice|date=2014|volume=64|issue=625|pages=422–423|doi=10.3399/bjgp14X681169|pmc=4111334|issn=0960-1643|pmid=25071054}}&lt;/ref&gt; In social work, tick-box culture means there is too much emphasis on following rules instead of actually helping children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tick-box-culture-for-social-workers-needs-to-come-to-an-end-6399989.html|title='Tick box culture' for social workers needs to come to an end|date=10 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tick-box culture is also studied as a contributing factor in a number of fields, such as education, criminal justice and medicine. Other synonymous terms include '''culture of performativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Bethan. "A crisis for efficacy?." ''Education Review'' 20, no. 1 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = Stephen J | year = 2003 | title = The teacher's soul and the terrors of performativity | url = | journal = Journal of education policy | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 215–228 | doi=10.1080/0268093022000043065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US criminal justice system, some performance measures appear to have more influence on outcomes than others, and police targets have led to the criminalization of greater numbers of children, while goals for reduction youth in detention remain unmet.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, Tim. "‘Target practice’: sanction detection and the criminalisation of children: Tim Bateman sets out how police targets have led to the criminalisation of greater numbers of children and dispels the myth of a girl crime wave." Criminal justice matters 73, no. 1 (2008): 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, probation officers reportedly spend 75% of their time on red tape, and the tick-box culture was blamed for the growth in bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/27/probation-officers-bureaucracy-report|title=Probation officers spend 75% of time not dealing with offenders, report finds|first1=Alan|last1=Travis|first2=home affairs|last2=editor|date=26 July 2011|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, crime prevention is thought to have shifted away from reducing opportunities for money laundering towards an emphasis on the demonstration of compliance with systems and procedures (tick-box culture) with the expectation that they will prevent money laundering from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Jackie. "Controlling the flow of money or satisfying the regulators." The organised crime economy (2005): 43-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, in an effort to reduce tick box inspections, school inspections were greatly reduced and greater emphasis placed on professional judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Jacqueline, and John Clarke. "Farewell to the tick box inspector? Ofsted and the changing regime of school inspection in England." Oxford Review of Education 39, no. 5 (2013): 702-718.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Theresa May]] stated that she wanted to stop the "tick box culture" of policing in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sky.com/story/may-tells-police-officers-stop-crying-wolf-10358852&lt;/ref&gt;

Tick-box culture in medicine is seen as a system increasingly engineered to medical technicians rather than to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gannon | first1 = Craig | year = 2005 | title = Will the lead clinician please stand up?. | url = | journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | volume = 330 | issue = 7493| pages = 737–737 | doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7493.737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, a study found that clinical audit are perceived by practitioners as time-consuming and a managerially driven exercise with no associated professional rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowie | first1 = Paul | last2 = Bradley | first2 = Nicholas A. | last3 = Rushmer | first3 = Rosemary | year = 2012 | title = Clinical audit and quality improvement–time for a rethink?. | url = | journal = Journal of evaluation in clinical practice | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 42–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a hospital in England was investigated over the death of young woman who was being monitored by hospital staff, the tick-box culture was blamed in part for the woman's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9380740/Hospital-tick-box-culture-contributed-to-death-of-girl-18.html|title=Hospital tick-box culture contributed to death of girl, 18|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English commentators blamed tick-box culture for the outcome of several incidents in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/nick-ferrari/507984/Tick-box-culture-is-ruining-our-country&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15163">{{Anthropology}}
In [[cultural anthropology]] and [[cultural geography]], '''cultural diffusion''', as conceptualized by [[Leo Frobenius]] in his 1897/98 publication ''Der westafrikanische [[Kulturkreis]]'', is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|style]]s, [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]]—between individuals, whether within a single culture or from one culture to another. It is distinct from the [[diffusion of innovations]] within a specific culture. Examples of diffusion include the spread of the [[war chariot]] and [[iron]] [[smelting]] in ancient times, and the use of [[automobile]]s and Western [[business suit]]s in the 20th century.

==Types==
Five major types of cultural diffusion have been defined:
* Expansion diffusion: an innovation or idea that develops in a source area and remains strong there, while also spreading outward to other areas. This can include hierarchical, stimulus, and contagious diffusion.
* Relocation diffusion: an idea or innovation that migrates into new areas, leaving behind its origin or source of the cultural trait.
* Hierarchical diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads by moving from larger to smaller places, often with little regard to the distance between places, and often influenced by social elites.
* Contagious diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on person-to-person contact within a given population.
* Stimulus diffusion: an idea or innovation that spreads based on its attachment to another concept.

==Mechanisms==
Inter-cultural diffusion can happen in many ways. [[Human migration|Migrating populations]] will carry their culture with them. Ideas can be carried by trans-cultural visitors, such as merchants, [[exploration|explorers]], soldiers, diplomats, slaves, and hired artisans. Technology diffusion has often occurred by one society luring skilled scientists or workers by payments or other inducement. Trans-cultural marriages between two neighboring or interspersed cultures have also contributed. Among literate societies, diffusion can occur through letters, books, and, in modern times, through electronic media.

There are three categories of diffusion mechanisms:
*'''Direct diffusion''' occurs when two cultures are very close to each other, resulting in intermarriage, trade, and even warfare. An example of direct diffusion is between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where the people living on the border of these two countries engage in hockey, which started in Canada, and baseball, which is popular in American culture.
*'''Forced diffusion''' occurs when one culture subjugates (conquers or enslaves) another culture and forces its own customs on the conquered people. An example would be the forced [[Christianity|Christianization]] of the [[indigenous peoples]] of the Americas by the Spanish, French, English and Portuguese, or the forced [[Islamization]] of West African peoples by the [[Fula people|Fula]] or of the [[Nuristan]]is by the Afghans.
*'''Indirect diffusion''' happens when traits are passed from one culture through a middleman to another culture, without the first and final cultures being in direct contact. An example could be the presence of [[Mexican food]] in Canada, since a large territory (the United States) lies between.

Direct diffusion was common in ancient times, when small groups of humans lived in adjoining settlements. Indirect diffusion is common in today's world because of the [[mass media]] and invention of the [[Internet]]. Also of interest is the work of [[United States|American]] historian and critic [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] in his book ''[[The Discoverers]]'', in which he provides an historical perspective on the role of [[exploration|explorers]] in the [[diffusion of innovations]] between [[civilization]]s.

==Theories==
The many models that have been proposed for inter-cultural diffusion are:
*[[Migrationism]], the spread of cultural ideas by either gradual or sudden population movements 
*[[Kulturkreis|Culture circles]] diffusionism (''Kulturkreise'')—the theory that cultures originated from a small number of cultures
* "''Kulturkugel''" (a German compound meaning "culture bullet", [[Neologism|coined]] by [[J. P. Mallory]]), a mechanism suggested by Mallory&lt;ref&gt;In the context of [[Indo-Aryan migration]]; Mallory, "A European Perspective on Indo-Europeans in Asia". In ''The Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Peoples of Eastern and Central Asia''. Ed. Mair. Washington D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; to model the scale of [[invasion]] vs. gradual migration vs. diffusion. According to this model, local continuity of material culture and social organization is stronger than linguistic continuity, so that cultural contact or limited migration regularly leads to linguistic changes without affecting material culture or social organization.&lt;ref&gt;The term is a 'half-facetious' mechanical analogy, imagining a "bullet" of which the tip is material culture and the "charge" is language and social structure. Upon "intrusion" into a host culture, migrants will "shed" their material culture (the "tip") while possibly still maintaining their "charge" of language and, to a lesser extent, social customs (viz., the effect is a [[diaspora]] culture, which depending on the political situation may either form a [[substratum]] or a [[superstratum]] within the host culture).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trans-cultural diffusion#Hyperdiffusionism|Hyperdiffusionism]]—the theory that all cultures originated from one culture

A concept that has often been mentioned in this regard, which may be framed in the evolutionary diffusionism model, is that of "an idea whose time has come" — whereby a new cultural item appears almost simultaneously and independently in several widely separated places, after certain prerequisite items have diffused across the respective communities. This concept was invoked with regard to the independent development of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]], and the inventions of the [[airplane]] and of the [[electronic computer]].

==Hyperdiffusionism==
{{Main article|Hyperdiffusionism in Archaeology}}
Hyperdiffusionists deny that [[parallel evolution]] or independent invention took place to any great extent throughout history; they claim that all major inventions and all cultures can be traced back to a single culture.&lt;ref&gt;Legend and lore of the Americas before 1492: an encyclopedia of visitors, explorers, and immigrants, Ronald H. Fritze, 1993, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Early theories of hyperdiffusionism can be traced to ideas about [[South America]] being the origin of mankind. [[Antonio de León Pinelo]], a Spaniard who settled in [[Bolivia]], claimed in his book ''Paraíso en el Nuevo Mundo'' that the [[Garden of Eden]] and the creation of man had occurred in present-day Bolivia and that the rest of the world was populated by [[Human migration|migration]]s from there. Similar ideas were also held by Emeterio Villamil de Rada; in his book ''La Lengua de Adán'' he attempted to prove that [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]] was the original language of mankind and that humanity had originated in [[Sorata]] in the Bolivian [[Andes]]. The first scientific defence of humanity originating in South America came from the Argentine [[paleontologist]] [[Florentino Ameghino]] in 1880, who published his research in ''La antigüedad del hombre en el Plata''.&lt;ref&gt;Indians of the Andes: Aymaras and Quechuas, Harold Osborne, 2004, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that [[copper]]–producing knowledge spread from [[Egypt]] to the rest of the world along with [[megalithic]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists,'' Gérald Gaillard, 2004, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient [[Egyptians]] and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers. His views became known as "Egyptocentric-Hyperdiffusionism".&lt;ref&gt;Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology, Peter Lancaster Brown, 2000, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James Perry]] elaborated on Smith's hypothesis by using [[ethnographic]] data. Another hyperdiffusionist was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]; in his book ''How Came Civilization'' (1939) he wrote that instead of Egypt all culture and civilization had come from [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sociocultural Evolution: Calculation and Contingency,'' Bruce G. Trigger, 1998, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperdiffusionism after this did not entirely disappear, but it was generally abandoned by mainstream academia.

==Medieval Europe==
Diffusion theory has been advanced{{according to whom|date=July 2015}} as an explanation for the "[[European miracle]]", the adoption of technological innovation in [[medieval Europe]] which by the 17th century culminated in European technological achievement surpassing [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|the Islamic world]] and [[Ming China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo M. Cipolla, ''Before the Industrial revolution: European Society and Economy 1000–1700, W.W. Norton and Co., New York (1980) {{ISBN|0-393-95115-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such technological import to medieval Europe include [[gunpowder]], [[clock]] mechanisms, [[shipbuilding]], [[paper]] and the [[windmill]], however, in each of these cases Europeans not only adopted the technologies, but improved the manufacturing scale, inherent technology, and applications to a point clearly surpassing the evolution of the original invention in its country of origin.

Historians{{who|date=July 2015}} have questioned recently{{year needed|date=July 2015}} whether Europe really owes the development of such inventions as gunpowder, the compass, the windmill or printing to the Chinese or other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson: ''The Mongols and the West'', Pearson Longman 2005, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald F. Lach]]: ''Asia in the Making of Europe''. 3 volumes, Chicago, Illinois, 1965–93; I:1, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bartlett: ''The Making of Europe. Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950–1350'', Allen Lane, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

However historian Peter Frankopan argues that influences, particularly trade, through the middle east &amp; central Asia to China through the silk roads have been overlooked in traditional histories of the "rise of the west". He argues that the renaissance was funded with trade with the east (due to the demise of Byzantium at the hands of Venice and the 4th Crusade), and that the trade allowed ideas and technology to be shared with Europe. But the constant warfare and rivalry in Europe meant there was extreme evolutionary pressure for developing these ideas for military and economic advantage, and a desperate need to use them in expansion.&lt;ref&gt;'The Silk Roads: A New History of the Workd' {{ISBN|9781101912379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
{{further information|Migrationism and diffusionism}}
While the concept of diffusion is well accepted in general, conjectures about the existence or the extent of diffusion in some specific contexts have been hotly disputed. An example of such disputes is the proposal by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] that similarities between the culture of [[Polynesia]] and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the [[Andes]] are due to diffusion from the latter to the former—a theory that currently has few supporters among professional anthropologists.
Heyerdahl's theory of Polynesian origins has not gained acceptance among [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Suggs ''The Island Civilizations of Polynesia'', New York: New American Library, pp. 212-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, P. (2000). ''On the Roads to the Wind: An archaeological history of the Pacific Islands before European contact''.

In the late 1990s, [[genetics|genetic]] testing found that the [[mitochondrial DNA]] of the Polynesians is more similar to people from southeast Asia than to people from South America, showing that their ancestors most likely came from Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedlaender, J.S.|title=The genetic structure of Pacific Islanders|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e19|year=2008 |pmid=18208337|pmc=2211537|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0040019|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trivium''' is the lower division of the [[seven liberal arts]] and comprises [[grammar]], [[dialectic]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="english-ety"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |editor1=Onions, C.T. |year=1991 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivium is implicit in ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by [[Martianus Capella]], but the term was not used until the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], when it was coined in imitation of the earlier [[quadrivium]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les arts libéraux dans l'Antiquité classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'études médiévales). pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in [[Plato]]'s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx and http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means "the place where three roads meet" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which comprised [[arithmetic]] (number), [[geometry]] (number in space), [[music]] (number in time), and [[astronomy]] (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="english-ety" /&gt;

== Description ==

'''[[Grammar]]''' teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student "comes to terms," defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.

'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the "mechanics" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.

'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).

[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

'''. . .'''

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VBaVSH.jpg|right|thumb|250px|February 14, 2007 at the [[Vermont State House]]. The Valentine Phantom struck early on a snowy morning.]]
The '''Valentine Phantom''', often referred to as the '''Valentine Bandit''' in media reports, refers to an unidentified individual or group who each [[Valentine's Day]] secretly decorate the downtown area of a city in the United States with a series of red hearts printed on sheets of letter-sized paper.

The reports began in [[Portland, Maine]] in 1985, and the perpetrators remain unknown. Speculation about the individual or group which decorates before dawn each February 14 is popular in conversation, and local media, and over the past ten years has emerged as an example of [[vernacular culture]].

==History==
The earliest known occurrence of this phenomenon was 1976 in [[Portland, Maine]].  Every year since, red hearts have appeared throughout the city on Valentine's Day morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/02/12/living/random-acts-of-cupid-portlands-valentine-phantom-set-to-strike/ |title=Random acts of Cupid: Portland’s ‘Valentine Phantom’ set to strike |last=Pierce |first=Kathleen |date=February 12, 2015 |website=[[Bangor Daily News]] |location=Bangor, Maine |accessdate=February 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Beginning in the early 2000s, red hearts drawn on white sheets of paper have been attached to the doors of businesses along the Pearl Street business district in [[Boulder, Colorado]] each Valentine's Day, according to reports&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Vanessa. (15 February 2008) [http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/feb/14/valentines-bandit-strikes-again/ Mystery hearts return to Boulder's Pearl Street] ''[[Daily Camera]]''. Accessed 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Daily Camera'' newspaper. In Boulder, the mysterious Valentine's messenger has been dubbed the "kissing bandit."  

In 2002, the city of [[Montpelier, Vermont]] became a part of the yearly tradition, with the added twist of each heart including a poem signed "The Valentine Phantom".

On Valentine's Day 2010, pink hearts appeared up and down [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury, Vermont's]] Railroad &amp; Main Street, even finding their way to the local police and fire department buildings.

On Valentine's Day 2012, this phenomenon spread to [[Bangor, Maine]] when Bangorians woke up to a flurry of red and white hearts throughout downtown Bangor and the tradition continues into 2013 with the addition of cute messages and candy.

On Valentine's Day 2017, the bandit allowed a ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' reporter to accompany them on their travels, in return for anonymity. The bandit, after tagging a [[Planned Parenthood]] office in Portland, stated that they are normally apolitical but felt "we could be a bit more progressive this year". A Planned Parenthood spokesperson stated that a liaison for the bandit contacted them the prior week to request permission to post a heart banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2017/02/14/news/portland/a-night-out-with-portlands-secretive-valentine-phantom/ |title=We followed the mysterious Valentine Phantom who puts hearts all over Portland|last=Pierce |first=Kathleen |date=February 12, 2017 |website=[[Bangor Daily News]] |location=Bangor, Maine |accessdate=February 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont history===
Montpelier's incarnation of the phenomenon began in 2002{{Disputed-inline|Valentine Bandit|date=May 2013}} near the corner of Main Street and State Street. The windows of shops were covered in 8.5" x 11" color copies of red hearts. They appeared before dawn, and for the most part were welcome and not seen as a nuisance. In subsequent years the center remained the intersection of Main and State streets, but grew outward to include Langdon Street, Elm Street, and lower State Street near the [[Vermont State House|State House]] and the [[The Pavilion (government building)|Pavilion]]. This raised speculation that the Valentine Phantom might be a team. 

In 2006, for the first time, the "bandit" applied banners with large red hearts around the base of the columns on the portico of the [[Vermont State House]]. They were photographed, reproduced on web blogs and on the website of the [[Friends of the Vermont State House]]. These same banners were again displayed on the statehouse in 2007.  On Valentine's Day 2008, they appeared on the chimney stack of [[Montpelier High School (Vermont)|Montpelier High School]] and on the tower of College Hall at the [[Vermont College of Fine Arts]].  In 2009, they were hung over the entrance of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library and from the landslide cliff on Elm Street. In 2010, two heart banners were hung from the Langdon Street Bridge.

[[Image:Langdon Street Bridge 2010.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Langdon Street Bridge, Montpelier VT, February 14, 2010]]

On Valentine's Day 2007, the phenomenon became larger, and coincided with a dumping of heavy snow. The [[Barre Montpelier Times Argus|''Times Argus'']] reported, "Despite the snow, however, the Valentine bandit visited the Statehouse and other buildings in Montpelier on Wednesday to put up large red paper hearts. Other state buildings, stores and restaurants were also visited during the night, with business windows throughout downtown Montpelier covered in the red paper hearts&amp;nbsp;– a mystery that has become a Valentine’s Day tradition in the state’s capital city."&lt;ref&gt;Staff reports. (14 February 2007) [http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070214/NEWS/70214004/1002 'Storm of the Century' hits Vermont - 7:00 p.m.] ''[[Times Argus]]''. Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, sculptural hearts painted red were planted on the public lawn&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Brodeur, Jeb. (14 February 2007) [http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070214/NEWS/70214009 Valentine bandit strikes again] ''[[Times Argus]]''. Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in front of the State House. A blizzard brought a fresh coat of snow setting off the bright red heart sculptures. The Vermont State House Sergeant at Arms, Francis Brooks, allowed the valentine banners and sculptures to remain through the day.

During the winter of 2008, the slate roof on the steeple of the Methodist church on Main Street in Montpelier was replaced by Southgate Steeple Jacks.  The new slate roof features several red hearts around the base of the steeple.  Jay Southgate designed the new roof for the church and was quoted in the Montpelier Bridge saying that the use of the hearts was inspired by Montpelier's Valentine Phantom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}   Coincidentally, February 14, 2008 was the first sunny, calm day in several weeks, allowing the Southgate crew to resume their work on the roof&amp;nbsp;— that's the day they began to place the red slate of the hearts on the steeple.

On September 1, 2009, rainbow hearts mimicking the Valentine Bandit appeared around Montpelier to celebrate the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in Vermont]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} 

On the morning of February 14, 2015, the residents of Montpelier awoke to find that the tradition had been broken; no hearts appeared throughout the city.  In response, a group of students from the local high school hung hearts that afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesargus.com/articles/from-montpelier-with-lovelocal-high-school-students-rescue-a-heartwarming-tradition/|title=From Montpelier, with love Local high school students rescue a heartwarming tradition {{!}} Times Argus|last=Blaisdell|first=Eric|date=2015-02-15|work=Times Argus|access-date=2018-01-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Valentine Phantom has struck again each year since.

[[File:Sample conworld.jpg|frame|A rendered constructed world as seen from [[outer space]]]]
'''Worldbuilding''' is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name=hamilton2009/&gt; The resulting world may be called a '''constructed world'''. Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a [[history]], [[Fictional geography|geography]], and [[ecology]] is a key task for many science fiction or [[fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian M. |last=Stableford |year=2004 |title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0-8108-4938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldbuilding often involves the creation of [[Fantasy map|map]]s, a [[backstory]], and people for the world.  Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and [[Cognitive training|mental exercise]], or for specific creative endeavors such as [[novel]]s, [[video game]]s, or [[role-playing game]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term "world-building" was first used in the ''Edinburgh Review'' in December 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in A.S. Eddington's ''Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory'' (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddington|first1=Arthur Stanley|title=Space, Time and Gravitation : an outline of the general relativity theory|date=1920|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegravita00eddirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used in [[science fiction]] and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoff’s ''Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199891405|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|editor=Jeff Prucher|page=270|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of literary fictional worlds was first examined by fantasy authors such as [[George MacDonald]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[C. S. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="MarkWolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation|author=Mark J.P. Wolf|isbn=9781136220814|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien addressed the issue in his essay ''On Fairy Stories'', where he stated that the "Secondary World" or "Sub-Creation" (the constructed world) is substantially different from the art of play-writing: "Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories"&gt;{{citation|title=On Fairy Stories|author=J. R. R. Tolkien|work=The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pp=109–161|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed worlds shift away from storytelling, narrative, characters and figures, and may explore "trees as trees" or aspects of the world in-and-of-themselves. Later analysis of fantasy worlds in the 1960s contextualized them in the medium or the narrative of the works, offering an analysis of the stories in the world, but not the world itself. [[Media franchise]]s are similar to constructed worlds but do not necessarily rely on them; for example a media franchise such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' has a constructed world, while [[The Beatles]], as a franchise, does not. In the 2000s, world-building in film has increased in popularity. When before, writers sought to create a character that could sustain multiple stories, now they create a world that can sustain multiple characters and stories.&lt;ref name="MarkWolf" /&gt;

==Methods==
Worldbuilding can be designed from [[Top-down and bottom-up design|the top down or the bottom up]], or by a combination of these approaches. The official world-building guidelines for ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' refer to these terms as "outside-in" and "inside-out", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first1=Monte |last1=Cook |authorlink1=Monte Cook |first2=Jonathan |last2=Tweet |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet |first3=Skip |last3=Williams |authorlink3=Skip Williams |others=revised by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] |year=2003 |title=[[Dungeon Master's Guide]] |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |isbn=0-7869-2889-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the top-down approach, the [[designer]] first creates a general overview of the world, determining broad characteristics such as the world's inhabitants, [[technology]] level, major geographic features, [[climate]], and history. From there, he or she develops the rest of the world in increasing detail. This approach might involve creation of the world's basics, followed by levels such as [[continent]]s, [[civilization]]s, [[Fictional country|nation]]s, [[Fictional city|cities]], and [[town]]s. A world constructed from the top down tends to be well-integrated, with individual components fitting together appropriately. It can, however, require considerable work before enough detail is completed for the setting to be useful, such as in the setting of a story.

With the bottom-up approach, the designer focuses on a small part of the world needed for his or her purposes. This location is given considerable detail, such as local geography, [[culture]], [[social structure]], [[government]], [[politics]], [[commerce]], and history. Prominent local individuals may be described, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] to each other. The surrounding areas are then described in a lower level of detail, with description growing more general with increasing distance from the initial location. The designer can subsequently enhance the description of other areas in the world. This approach provides for almost immediate applicability of the setting, with details pertinent to a certain story or situation. The approach can yield a world plagued with [[Consistency|inconsistencies]], however. By combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches, a designer can enjoy the benefits of both. This is very hard to accomplish, however, because the need to start from both sides creates twice as much work, which may delay the desired product.

Despite requiring considerable work to develop enough detail for a setting to be useful, not every aspect of a setting can be explored, and instead an approach called inferred world building is often used. Inferred world building is when the author provides enough detail about the various parts of a setting that readers can extrapolate on what is written to come to their own conclusions regarding specific details that weren't provided. This is especially useful for roleplaying game settings, as individual games may require certain details to be created on a case-by-case basis for the RPG's story to function.

==Elements==
From a game-design perspective, the goal of worldbuilding is to create the context for a story. Consistency is an important element, since the world provides a foundation for the action of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francois Dominic |last=Laramee |year=2002 |title=Game design perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |isbn=1-58450-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. R. Tolkien described the goal of worldbuilding as creating immersion, or "enchantment" as he put it, and descriptions of the world can be wholly disconnected from the story and narrative.&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories" /&gt;

An uninhabited world can be useful for certain purposes, especially in science fiction, but the majority of constructed worlds have one or more [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. These species can have [[constructed culture]]s and [[constructed language]]s. Designers in [[hard science fiction]] may design [[flora]] and [[fauna]] towards the end of the worldbuilding process, thus creating lifeforms with environmental adaptations to scientifically novel situations.

===Physics===
Perhaps the most basic consideration of worldbuilding is to what degree a fictional world will be based on real-world [[physics]] compared to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. While magic is a more common element of fantasy settings, science fiction worlds can contain magic or technological equivalents of it. For example, the Biotics in the science fiction video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' have abilities, described scientifically in-game, which mirror those of [[Magician (fantasy)|mages]] in fantasy games. In the science fiction novel ''[[Midnight at the Well of Souls]]'', magic exists, but is explained scientifically.

Some fictional worlds modify the real-world [[Physical law|laws of physics]]; [[faster-than-light]] travel is a common factor in much science fiction. Worldbuilding may combine physics and magic, such as in the ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

===Cosmology===
Constructed worlds often have cosmologies, both in the [[Physical cosmology|scientific]] and [[Religious cosmology|metaphysical]] senses of the word. Design of science fiction worlds, especially those with [[spacefaring]] societies, usually entails creation of a [[star system]] and [[planet]]s. If the designer wishes to apply real-life principles of astronomy, he or she may develop detailed [[Astronomy|astronomical]] measures for the [[orbit]] of the world, and to define the physical characteristics of the other bodies in the same system; this establishes [[Chronology|chronological]] parameters, such as the length of a day and the durations of [[season]]s.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book |first=Poul |last=Anderson |authorlink=Poul Anderson |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Worlds |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are intentionally bizarre. For [[Larry Niven]]'s novels ''[[The Integral Trees]]'' and ''[[The Smoke Ring (novel)|The Smoke Ring]]'', Niven designed a "freefall" environment, a gas [[torus]] ring of habitable pressure, temperature, and composition, around a [[neutron star]].

Fantasy worlds can also involve unique cosmologies. In ''Dungeons and Dragons'', the physical world is referred to as the Prime Material Plane, but other planes of existence devoted to moral or elemental concepts are available for play, such as the [[Spelljammer]] setting, which provides an entirely novel fantasy astrophysical system. Some fantasy worlds feature religions. The ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series, for example, contains a variety of religions practiced by its world's various races. The world of the 2000 video game ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' has a well-developed cosmology, including a [[creation myth]].

===Geography{{anchor|Map making}}===
Map construction is often one of the earliest tasks of worldbuilding. Maps can lay out a world's basic [[terrain]] features and significant civilizations present. A clear, concise map that displays the locations of key points in the story can be a helpful tool for developers and audiences alike. Finished creative products, such as books, may contain published versions of development maps; many editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for example, include maps of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cartography]] of fictional worlds is sometimes called ''geofiction''.&lt;ref name=map_hacks2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Schuyler |last1=Erle |first2=Rich |last2=Gibson |first3=Jo |last3=Walsh |isbn=0-596-00703-5 |page=508 |title=Mapping hacks: tips &amp; tools for electronic cartography |series=Hacks Series |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiO5JtP171oC&amp;pg=PA508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physical geography]] of a fictional world is important in designing [[weather]] patterns and [[biome]]s such as [[desert]]s, [[wetlands]], [[mountain]]s, and [[forest]]s. These physical features also affect the growth and interaction of the various societies, such as the establishment of [[trade route]]s and locations of important cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven S. |last=Long |year=2002 |title=Fantasy HERO |pages=290&amp;ndash;294 |edition=[[Hero System]] Fifth |publisher=DOJ |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58366-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for control of [[natural resource]]s in a fictional world may lead to [[war]] among its people. Geography can also define [[ecosystem]]s for each biome. Often, Earth-like ecology is assumed, but designers can vary drastically from this trend. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[short story]] "[[The Talking Stone]]" features a life form based on [[silicon]], rather than [[Carbon-based life|carbon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Clement |authorlink=Hal Clement |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Beings |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[software]] programs can create random terrain using [[fractal]] algorithms. Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plate movement and [[erosion]]; the resulting world can be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in great detail, providing a degree of realism to the result.

===Culture===
Constructed cultures, or concultures, are a typical element of worldbuilding. Worldbuilders sometimes employ past human civilizations as a model for fictional societies. The 1990 video game ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire]]'', for example, takes place in a world full of [[tribe]]s based on civilizations in early [[Mesoamerica]] and Africa. This method can make a fictional world more accessible for an audience. ''Simon Provencher'' has stated as a 'Golden Rule' of Worldbuilding that "... unless specified otherwise, everything inside your world is assumed to behave exactly as it would in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provencher|first=Simon|title=The Golden Rule of Worldbuilding|url=http://www.worldbuilderblog.com/the-golden-rule-of-worldbuilding/|work=Worldbuilder|publisher=Simon Provencher|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven S. Long]], a representative of the [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] role-playing game, who stated that "Everything that happened in the real world has also unfolded in the exact same way in the Champions Universe." This means any past wars, elections, and technological advancements in our world occurred the same way in the Champions Universe unless explained otherwise.  Creating a cohesive [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture can be a distinct challenge. Some designers have also looked to human civilizations for inspiration in doing so, such as ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, whose society resembles that of [[Ancient Rome]]. The fictional world's history can explain past and present relationships between different societies, which can introduce a story's action. A past war, for example, functions as a key plot point in the ''[[Shannara]]'' and ''[[Belgariad]]'' series.

==Types of constructed worlds==
Examples of constructed worlds include [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the pseudo-Earth [[Hyborian Age]] in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan series]], Arrakis in the ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series, the continent of [[Tamriel]] in the [[Elder Scrolls]] series of games,  [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and [[Gethen]], the Subcontinent of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the location of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Constructed worlds are not always limited to one type of story. [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] and [[Steven Brust]] created [[Ethshar]] and [[Dragaera]], respectively, for role-playing games before using them as settings for novels. [[M. A. R. Barker]] originally designed [[Tékumel]] well before the advent of role-playing games, but many [[gamer]]s, including Barker himself, have used it as a setting for such games.

A [[shared universe]] is a fictional universe that can be used by different authors. Examples of shared universes include the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] and [[campaign setting]] developed specifically for role-playing games. One of the oldest of these is [[Oerth]], developed for the Dungeons and Dragons [[Greyhawk]] setting. [[Forgotten Realms]] is another such D&amp;D setting, originally a [[House rule#Gaming|homebrew]] campaign world by [[Ed Greenwood]].
