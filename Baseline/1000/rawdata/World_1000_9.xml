There are multiple claims to the world's '''biggest ball of twine''' record in the United States.  As of 2014, the ball of [[twine]] with the largest circumference is located in [[Cawker City, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/twisted-the-battle-to-be-the-worlds-largest-ball-of-twine/379828/?single_page=true The Battle to Be the World's Largest Ball of Twine; ''The Atlantic Magazine'', September 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest ball of sisal twine built by a community==
In [[Cawker City, Kansas]], Frank Stoeber created a ball that had 1.6 million feet (490,000 m) of twine and {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} when he died in 1974. Cawker City built an open-air gazebo over Stoeber's ball where every August a "Twine-a-thon" is held and more twine is added to the ball. By 2006, the twine ball had reached 17,886 pounds (8,111 kg, 8.9 US tons), a circumference of {{convert|40|ft|m}}, and a length of {{convert|7801766|ft|km mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/8543 |title=World's Largest Ball of Twine |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;  In 2013, its weight was estimated at 19,973 pounds.  In August 2014, the ball measures {{convert|41.42|ft|m}} in circumference, {{convert|8.06|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|10.83|ft|m}} in height, and is still growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansas.com/news/state/article2288865.html ''Cawker City wins the ball game with massive sphere of twine''; The Wichita Eagle; September 28, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic2014"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/twisted-the-battle-to-be-the-worlds-largest-ball-of-twine/379828/?single_page=true ''Twisted: The Battle to Be the World's Largest Ball of Twine''; The Atlantic; September 9, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest ball of sisal twine built by a single person==
[[Image:Twineball.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Twine ball in [[Darwin, Minnesota]] (2006)]]
[[Darwin, Minnesota]], is the home of a ball of [[baler twine]] rolled by Francis A. Johnson. It is {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter and weighs {{convert|17,400|lb|kg ST}}. Johnson began rolling the twine in March 1950, and wrapped four hours every day for 29 years. It is currently housed in an enclosed gazebo across from the town park on Main Street at ({{coord|45.096332|-94.410276|type:landmark_region:US-MN_scale:500}}) to prevent the public from touching it.  The town celebrates "Twine Ball Day" on the second Saturday in August every year. An adjacent volunteer-run, free to visit museum and gift shop has information on the history of the ball, as well as selling a variety of souvenirs.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Balls of String|work=ABC Evening News|date=1993-12-28|author=Charles Murphy|publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=145726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WLTB-RSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Twine balls|publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com|date=|author1=Doug Kirby |author2=Ken Smith |author3=Mike Wilkins  |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/MNDARtwine.html|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Darwin's Twine Ball Museum |url=http://www.dasselenterprisedispatch.com/twine-ball-darwin.html |publisher=Dassel-Cotako Enterprise Dispatch |accessdate=January 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107005243/http://www.dasselenterprisedispatch.com/twine-ball-darwin.html |archivedate=January 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye To Eye: On The Road Again|work=CBS|date=2008-11-12|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4597446n}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the long-standing holder of the "biggest ball of twine" title in the Guinness Book of World Records, holding the title from its completion in 1979 until 1994, and was referenced by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] in his 1989 song "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota."&lt;ref name="atlantic2014"/&gt;

==Heaviest twine ball==
In [[Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin]], James Frank Kotera claims to have made the heaviest ball of twine ever built. He started it in 1979 and is still working. Kotera estimates, by measuring the weight of each bag of twine that he winds on, that the ball weighs 8,770&amp;nbsp;kg (19,336 pounds), making it the heaviest ball of twine ever built. The ball is housed in an open-air enclosure in Kotera's lawn. The ball has a smaller companion, "Junior", that is made of string.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/10970 |title=JFK's Twine Ball: World's Largest? |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest nylon twine ball==
In [[Branson, Missouri]], a ball of [[nylon]] twine built by J. C. Payne of [[Valley View, Texas|Valley View]], Texas, is on display in [[Ripley's Believe It or Not]] museum. The ball, which measures 41.5 feet (12.6 m) in circumference, was certified as the world's largest ball of twine by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in 1993. It is, however, the lightest of the four contenders, weighing 12,000 pounds.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F2231E0A85F7B73&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title= Texans have a ball, but unraveled twine king unimpressed |work=San Antonio Express |date=December 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/23134 |title=World's Largest Ball of Twine, Branson, Missouri |publisher=RoadsideAmerica.com |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s album ''[[UHF - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff]]'' has a song called "The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota". Although ostensibly about the ball in Darwin, Minnesota, Yankovic takes artistic license with the statistics.
** In a case of [[life imitating art]], postcards that read "Greetings from the Twine Ball, wish you were here," a fictitious invention of Yankovic's, are now an attraction in Darwin.  The Twineball Inn was a restaurant (not a motel) that has since closed.
**Yankovic refers to the ball itself, and thus his previous work, in the video for "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]", wherein a [[Trivial Pursuit]] card which includes the question "In what city is the largest ball of twine built by one man?" appears on screen.
*The ''[[Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road]]'' [[adventure game]] by [[LucasArts]] includes a stop at a ''Biggest Ball of Twine'', which is about 50 feet (15 m) tall with a rotating restaurant on top - this fictional ball of twine is located at Central Dis, Minnesota. An exhibit in the museum at its base claims that its mass will eventually cause the Earth to gravitate towards the sun, destroying the planet.  When the characters look at the ball of twine, the following exchange takes place:
:: Sam: It's things like this that make me wish I were Canadian.
:: Docent: They've got one of these too, but half of it's French.
*In one episode of ''[[Time Squad]]'', [[George W. Bush]] tries to lift the spirits of Americans by building the biggest ball of twine.
*The Cawker City, Kansas ball of twine was the subject of [[Garry Trudeau]]'s comic strip, [[Doonesbury]], on July 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Garry. [http://www.gocomics.com//doonesbury/2012/07/16 Doonesbury]. July 16, 2012. Retrieved January 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 2001 Canadian film, [[Jet Boy (film)|Jet Boy]], one of the characters drives a car into what is billed as the world's largest ball of string to test whether or not the structure is hollow.
*In the 1996 movie ''[[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]'', starring [[John Travolta]] as an angel on holiday on Earth, his character requests to stop and visit the biggest ball of twine that was supposedly located somewhere in [[Iowa]].
*In the 1983 movie ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', Clark Griswold ([[Chevy Chase]]) tries to entice his reluctant kids back into the family station wagon with a promise to take them to see "the second-largest ball of twine on the face of the earth, which is only four short hours away."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/quotes National Lampoon's Vacation (IMDB)]. Retrieved January 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1943 story ''The Mystery Yarn'', part of Robert McCloskey's children's book ''[[Homer Price]]'', two male rivals for a lady's affection, both of whom have string balls that are nearly six feet in diameter, stage a public contest to unravel the balls; they agree among themselves that the loser will be required to desist as a rival; however, the lady outsmarts their plan.

The '''boundaries between the continents''' of [[Earth]] are generally a matter of [[geography|geographical]] convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of [[continent]]s is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the [[Americas]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]] are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an [[island]] cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.

There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

* between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (dividing [[Eurasia]]): along the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Urals]] (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] or along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]])
* between Asia and [[Africa]] (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and [[Eurasia]]): at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]
* between [[North America]] and [[South America]] (dividing the [[Americas]]): the [[Isthmus of Panama]]
While the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the [[isthmus]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Red Sea]], dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

* the delineation of [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Australasia]] (part of [[Oceania]]) in the [[Ceram Sea]], [[Arafura Sea]], [[Timor Sea]], [[Halmahera Sea]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]
* the delineation between Africa, Europe and Asia in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* the delineation between Asia and Europe in the [[Arctic Ocean]]
* the delineation between Europe and North America in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* the delineation between North and South America in the [[Caribbean Sea]]
* the delineation of Asia from North America in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]

==Europe and Africa==
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The Mediterranean sea, between Africa &amp; Europe]]
[[File:Makaronesia.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Atlantic Ocean around the boundary]]
The [[Europea]]n and [[Africa]]n mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, [[Morocco]] and the European portion of [[Spain]] are separated by only {{convert|8.1|mi|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.

The Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the [[Azores]] is {{convert|1368|km|abbr=on}} from Europe and {{convert|1507|km|abbr=on}} from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Madeira]] islands off the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is {{convert|520|km|abbr=on}} from Africa and {{convert|1,000|km|abbr=on}} from Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225123213/http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}; {{cite web|url=http://listofafricancountries.com |title=Countries of Africa |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean island nation of [[Malta]] is approximately {{convert|81|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] is {{convert|207|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily while just {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast;  similarly, [[Pantelleria]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily and just {{convert|71|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.

==Europe and Asia==
The boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early [[Greek geographers]].
In the modern sense of the term "continent", [[Eurasia]] is more readily identifiable as a "continent", and Europe has occasionally been described as a [[subcontinent]] of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Slomp |title=Europe: A Political Profile |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22european+subcontinent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYCYoz-m3V&amp;sig=zCy9OfV_frpcoJH0acUWF8JGX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWUNVKlrx9qgBPmZgbAM&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22european%20subcontinent%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Historical Europe-Asia boundaries 1700 to 1900.png|thumb|upright|Conventions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The red line shows the most common modern convention, in use since {{circa|1850}} (see [[#Modern definition|below]]).
{{legend|#fcf9ea|Europe}}
{{legend|#d2d0c5|Asia}}
{{legend|#edfb9d|historically placed in either continent}}]]
The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. 

Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Herodotus+Phasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g8qiTbXZNtCVOuPjjDU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Phasis&amp;f=false p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt;
As geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the [[Hellenistic period]],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strabo (''[[Geographica]]'' 11.7.4) even at the time of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], "it was agreed by all that the Tanais river separated Asia from Europe" ({{lang|grc|ὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
τῆς Εὐρώπης ὁ Τάναϊς ποταμός}}; c.f. Duane W. Roller, ''Eratosthenes' Geography'', Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14267-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Eratosthenes+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdGiTeTEEY7rObCruTU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eratosthenes%20Tanais&amp;f=false p. 57])
&lt;/ref&gt; this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;
W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;

Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738&amp;dq=Posidonius+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E8-iTdzLH8aZOuXPuTQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanais&amp;f=false p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178)) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]],  the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417143618/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22watershed+of+the+Caucasus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4bCdTeaeEpDsOeK6iOgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22watershed%20of%20the%20Caucasus%22&amp;f=false Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Moores, R. W. Fairbridge, ''Encyclopedia of European and Asian regional geology'', Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-412-74040-4}}, p. 34: "most Soviet geographers took the watershed of the Main Range of the Greater Caucasus as the boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

The modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]]-[[Sea of Marmara]]-[[Bosphorus]] (together known as the [[Turkish Straits]]), the [[Black Sea]], along the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Greater Caucasus]], the northwestern portion of the [[Caspian Sea]] and along the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the [[National Geographic Society]] and as described in the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=9th|year=2011|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0634-4}} "Europe" (plate 59); "Asia" (plate 74): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}} Azerbaijan: Geography and Georgia: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to [[Southwest Asia|Southwest or West Asia]],&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100270/Caucasus |title=Caucasus |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and to a lesser extent [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] as well as with the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;Thomas De Waal.

The Turkish city [[Istanbul]] lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of [[Russian Empire|imperial conquests]] in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with [[Ottoman Empire|imperial conquests]] in Europe. [[Kazakhstan]] is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its [[West Kazakhstan Province|West Kazakhstan]] and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Ural"&gt;{{Cite book | title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}} Kazakhstan: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] (more precisely, the [[Manych River]], the [[Kuma–Manych Canal]] and the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]]) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'' (2011) s.v. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324715/Kuma-Manych-Depression "Kuma-Manych Depression"]: "It is often regarded as the natural boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  [[Stavropol]], [[Krasnodar]], and even areas just south of [[Rostov-on-Don]] in Asia.

A lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* listed as part of [[Eastern Europe]]: [[Russian Federation]]
* listed as part of [[Central Asia]]: [[Kazakhstan]]
* listed as part of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Turkey]]
 
According to UNSD, the aforementioned "assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other [[United Nations]] organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]  and [[UNESCO]] include both countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
[[Cyprus]] is an island of the Mediterranean located close to [[Asia Minor]], so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the [[Middle East]], as in the [[World Factbook]] and the [[United Nations geoscheme]], but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

The Greek [[Aegean Islands|North Aegean Islands]] and the [[Dodecanese]] lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).

==Europe and North America==
Europe and North America are separated by the [[North Atlantic]].
In terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Norwegian islands of [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the [[Azores]] are protrusions of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the [[North American Plate]].  (Definitions of "continents" are a physical and [[cultural construct]] dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of [[plate tectonics]]; thus, defining a "continent" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of [[geologists|geology]].)

===Islands===
The geographical notion of a [[continent]] stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[:continent#Noun|continent]] on [[Wiktionary]]. "from Latin ''continent-, continens'' 'continuous mass of land, mainland'" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent?show=1&amp;t=1301917145 merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.
This most notably includes the [[British Isles]] (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the [[island state]]s of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]].

Russia's [[Vaygach Island]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]] extend northward from the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]] and are a continuation of that chain into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the [[Kara Sea]]. The Russian Arctic [[archipelago]] of [[Franz Josef Land]] farther north is also associated with Europe.

Europe ends in the west at the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although Iceland and the [[Azores]] archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. [[Greenland]] is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.

==Africa and Asia==
[[File:TransAfrica.PNG|thumb|
{{legend|#FF0000|African part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFA500|Asian part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFFF00|Rest of Asia}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|Rest of Africa}}]]

Historically in [[Greco-Roman geography]], "Africa" meant [[Ancient Libya]], and its eastern extent was taken to be around [[Marmarica]], at the ''[[Catabathmus Magnus]]'', placing [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in Asia entirely.
The idea of Egypt being an "African" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;{{CN|date=August 2016}} the term  ''Africa'' was classically reserved for what is now known as the [[Maghreb]], to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the [[exploration of Africa]] the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's "natural" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, [[William George Browne]] still titled his travelogue ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria''. Similarly, [[James Bruce]] in 1835 published ''Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia''. On the other hand,
as early as 1670  [[John Ogilby]] under the title ''Africa'' published ''"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"''.

The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the [[Isthmus of Suez]], the narrowest gap between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Gulf of Suez]], the route today followed by the [[Suez Canal]]. This makes the [[Sinai Peninsula]] geographically Asian, and [[Egypt]] a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an [[African country]] entirely and not partly Asian.

But when discussing the geopolitical region of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]], Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the [[Middle East]], while Egypt's western neighbor [[Libya]] is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the [[Maghreb]]. However, they are both members of the [[Arab League]] as well as the [[African Union]].

The [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Comoros]] are island nations in the [[Indian Ocean]] associated with Africa. The island of [[Socotra]] may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of [[Yemen]], an Asian country.

==North and South America==
[[File:Countries-Panama-provinces-2005-10-18-en.png|thumb|225px|right|Panama with the Panama Canal.]]
{{Further|Americas|Central America}}

===Mainland===
The border between North America and South America is at some point on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the [[Serranía del Darién|Darién Mountains]] watershed divide along the [[Colombia]]-Panama [[Colombia–Panama border|border]] where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within [[North America]] and/or [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/mapping/outline-map/?map=Panama |title=National Geographic Education |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas (list)|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|page=4}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New Geographical Dictionary (list and map)|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|year=1984|pages=856, 859}}&lt;br&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;br&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=3 March 2008 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
Often most of the [[Caribbean islands]] are considered part of North America, but [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] lie on the [[continental shelf]] of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan [[Isla Aves]] and the Colombian [[San Andrés and Providencia]] lie on the North American shelf.

==Asia and North America==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[Bering Strait]] and [[Bering Sea]] separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the [[Diomede Islands]] in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The [[Aleutian Islands]] are an island chain extending westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward Russia's [[Komandorski Islands]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost [[Near Islands]] group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the [[North Aleutians Basin]] and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to be considered a transcontinental state.

[[St. Lawrence Island]] in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the [[Rat Islands]] in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are separated by only {{convert|2.5|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=off}}.

==The Americas and Oceania==
The [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Malpelo Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean are possessions of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], respectively, and associated with South America. The uninhabited French possession of [[Clipperton Island]] {{convert|600|mi|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=off}} off the Mexican coast is associated with North America.

[[Easter Island]], a territory of [[Chile]], is considered to be in Oceania, though politically it is associated with South America.

The United States of America controls numerous territories in Oceania, including the state of [[Hawaii]] and the territories of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[American Samoa]].

==Asia and Oceania==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wallace Line|Wallace]], [[Lydekker line|Lydekker]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]] Lines, the principals on [[Wallacea]] ]]
The [[Malay Archipelago]] is usually divided between Asia and [[Australasia]], most commonly along the anthropologic Melanesian line or [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]. Indonesia controls the western half of [[New Guinea]], geographically part of Australasia. The eastern half of the island is part of [[Papua New Guinea]] which is considered to be part of Oceania. Indonesia is  commonly referred to as one of the [[Asia#SouthEast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. [[East Timor]], an independent state that was formerly a territory of Indonesia, which is geographically part of Asia, is classified by the [[United Nations]] as part of the "South-Eastern Asia" block. It is [[ASEAN Summit#East Timor|expected to join]] the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/east-timor-asean-bid/2006/07/22/1153166635002.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=East Timor ASEAN bid | date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been involved as an ASEAN Regional Forum member since independence, and has participated in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] since [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|2003]]. Occasionally, all of the [[Malay Archipelago]] is included in Oceania, although this is extremely rare, especially as most of the archipelago lies on the Asian continental shelf.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] includes [[List of islands of Australia#External Territories|island possessions in Oceania]] and islands closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

==Antarctica==
Antarctica along with its outlying islands have no permanent population. All land claims south of 60°S latitude are held in abeyance by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

The [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are closer to Antarctica than to any other continent. However, they are politically associated with the inhabited [[Falkland Islands]] which are closer to South America. Furthermore, Argentina, a South American country, maintains its [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the islands. The continental shelf boundary separates the two island groups.

The [[Prince Edward Islands]] are located between Africa and Antarctica, and are the territory of South Africa, an African country.  The Australian [[Macquarie Island]] and the New Zealand [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell Islands]], are all located between the [[Oceania]]n countries of Australia and New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Transcontinental country#New Zealand|discussion]] --&gt;

Australia's [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the French [[Kerguelen Islands]] are located on the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], on the Antarctic continental plate. The French [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and the Norwegian [[Bouvet Island]] are also located on the Antarctic continental plate, and are not often associated with other continents.

==History==

The history of CMMB (known as a committee of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Hospital Association]] until 1927) dates back to 1912, when a personal tragedy inspired CMMB’s founder Dr. Paluel J. Flagg to commit to medical [[missionary]] work, beginning with [[leprosy]] patients in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt;

For many decades, CMMB prioritized the shipping of medical supplies and equipment to missionaries and health partners around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Garesche, [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=lnq The Catholic Medical Mission Board and its Work], ''The Linacre Quarterly'', Volume 2, Number 4. September 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Fulton J. Sheen|Bishop Fulton J. Sheen]], television personality and national director of the [[Society of the Propagation of the Faith]], joined CMMB’s board and served for 26 years.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt; Another stalwart supporter of CMMB has been the surgeon [[Tom Catena]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Perry, [http://world.time.com/2012/04/25/alone-and-forgotten-one-american-doctor-saves-lives-in-sudans-nuba-mountains/ Alone and Forgotten, One American Doctor Saves Lives in Sudan’s Nuba Mountains], ''Time''.

In 2002, CMMB introduced ''Born To Live'',&lt;ref name="Born To live"&gt;Georgetown University, Berkley Center, [http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/first-nationwide-faith-based-initiative-to-fight-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-launched-in-kenya First Nationwide Faith-based Initiative to Fight Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Launched in Kenya]. October 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; a program designed for the prevention of  [[Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS#Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)|mother-to-child (PMTCT) transmission of HIV]] which affected nearly 60,000 women in Haiti, Kenya and South Sudan.
 
In 2003, CMMB launched ''Action for Family Health'' to help reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of children in five Central American and Caribbean countries, through a partnership with the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO), Catholic healthcare networks, and the respective Ministries of Health in each country,&lt;ref name="Berkley" /&gt; providing [[deworming]] medicines to children.&lt;ref&gt;PAHO, [http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=13723&amp;Itemid=4031 "A Call to Action: Addressing Soil-transmitted Helminths in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean"].

{{Democracy}}Criticism of [[democracy]] is grounded in democracy's contested definition—its purpose, process, and outcomes. Since [[Classical antiquity]] and through the modern era, democracy has been associated with "rule of the people," "rule of the majority," and free selection or election either through direct participation or elected representation respectively, but has not been linked to a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Democracy – Definition of Democracy by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political thinkers approach their critique of democracy from different perspectives. Many do not necessarily oppose democracy—"rule of the people"—but, rather, seek to expand or question its popular definition. In their work, they distinguish between democratic principles that are effectively implemented through undemocratic procedures; undemocratic principles that are implemented through democratic procedures; and variations of the same kind.

For instance, some critics of democracy would agree with [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous remark, "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206|title=Parliament Bill|last=|first=|date=11 November 1947|website=api.parliament.uk|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others, may be more prepared to describe existing democratic regimes as anything but "rule of the people."

Critics of democracy have tried to highlight democracy's inconsistencies, paradoxes, and limits by contrasting it with other forms of governments. They have characterized most modern democracies as democratic [[Polyarchy|polyarchies]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1972|isbn=0300015658|location=New Haven|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and democratic [[Aristocracy|aristocracies]];&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Principles of Representative Government|last=Manin|first=Bernard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521458919|location=Cambridge|pages=2, 67–93, 132–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have identified [[Fascism|fascist]] moments in modern democracies; they have termed the societies produced by modern democracies as [[Neo-feudalism|neo-feudal]];&lt;ref&gt;Thom Hartmann, "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while, yet others, have contrasted democracy with [[Nazism]], [[anarcho-capitalism]], [[theocracy]], and [[absolute monarchy]].

The most widely known critics of democracy include [[Plato]] and [[The Federalist Papers|the authors of the Federalist Papers]], who were interested in establishing a [[representative democracy]] in America instead of a [[direct democracy]].

Additional historical figures associated with the critique of democracy thought include [[Aristotle]], [[Montesquieu]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Hubert Lagardelle]], [[Charles Maurras]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]], and [[Elazar Menachem Shach]].

Leading contemporary thinkers in critical democratic theory include [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Robert A. Dahl]], [[Robert E. Goodin]], [[Bernard Manin]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[James S. Fishkin]], [[Ian Shapiro]], [[Jason Brennan]], [[Hélène Landemore]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]].

==Criticism of democracy's purpose==

===Benefits of a specialized society===
One such argument is that the benefits of a specialized society may be compromised by democracy. As ordinary citizens are encouraged to take part in the political life of the country, they have the power to directly influence the outcome of government policies through the democratic procedures of voting, campaigning and the use of press. The result is that government policies may be more influenced by non-specialist opinions and thereby the effectiveness compromised, especially if a policy is very technically sophisticated and/or the general public inadequately informed. For example, there is no guarantee that those who campaign about the government's economic policies are themselves professional economists or academically competent in this particular discipline, regardless of whether they were well-educated. Essentially this means that a democratic government may not be providing the most good for the largest number of people. However, some have argued that this should not even be the goal of democracies because the minority could be seriously mistreated under that purported goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kenneth J. |last1=Arrow |first2=Robert C. |last2=Lind |date=June 1970  |title=Uncertainty and the Evaluation of Public Investment Decisions|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=364–378 |id= |jstor=1817987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule of the aristocratic ===

====Nietzsche====

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as an opponent of [[Christianity]], saw western democracy as connected to it, claiming that "the ''democratic'' movement is Christianity's heir" and denounced the democratic man for being inherently unable to "feel any shame for being unable to rise above" his desire "to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nietzsche-friedrich_inevitability-of-democracy-1886.htm|title=Friedrich Nietzsche / The Inevitabilty of Democracy -- 1886|website=www.cooperative-individualism.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Nietzsche claimed that in a democracy "[w]hen the individual's highest and strongest instincts break forth with a passion, driving him far and above the average, beyond the lowlands of the herd conscience", "the moral perspective now considers how harmful or harmless an opinion, an emotional state, a will, a talent is to the community, to equality". "Exalted, self-directed spirituality, a will to solitude, even great powers of reason are felt as a danger". "Morality in Europe today is herd animal morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Good and Evil / On the Genealogy of Morals|last=Nietzche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Clap Publishing, LLC|year=2018|isbn=1635378443|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manin ====
&lt;blockquote href="The Republic (Plato)"&gt;The real difference between ancient democracies and modern republics lies, according to Madison, in "''the total exclusion of the people in their collective capacity'' from any share in the ''latter'', and not in the ''total exclusion of the representatives of the people'' from the administration of the ''former''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— [[Bernard Manin]], p. 2 (See: Madison, "Federalist 63," in ''[[The Federalist Papers]],'' p. 387; Madison's emphasis.)&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Bernard Manin]] is interested in distinguishing modern representative [[republic]]s, such as the United States, from ancient direct [[Democracy|democracies]], such as Athens.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin believes that both aspire to "rule of the people," but that the nature of modern representative republics lends them to "rule of the aristocratic." Manin explains that in ancient democracies, virtually every citizen had the chance to be selected to populate the government but in modern republics, only elites have the chance of being elected. He does not defend this phenomenon but rather seeks to describe it.

Manin draws from [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to suggest that the dominant form of government, representative as opposed to direct, is effectively aristocratic.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; He proposes that modern representative governments exercise political power through aristocratic elections which, in turn, brings into question democracy's "rule of the people" principle. As far as Montesquieu is concerned, elections favor the "best" citizens who Manin notes tend to be wealthy and upper-class. As far as Rousseau is concerned, elections favor the incumbent government officials or the citizens with the strongest personalities, which results in hereditary aristocracy. Manin further evinces the aristocratic nature of representative governments by contrasting them with the ancient style of selection by lot. Manin notes that [[Montesquieu]] believed that lotteries prevent jealousy and distribute offices equally (among citizens from different ranks), while [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] believed that lotteries choose indifferently, preventing self-interest and partiality from polluting the citizen's choice (and thus prevent hereditary aristocracy).

However, Manin also provides criticism of direct democracy, or selection by lot.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin reflects on Montesquieu's interrogation of the extent to which [[Athenian democracy|Athenian direct democracy]] was truly direct. Montesquieu finds that citizens who had reason to believe they would be accused as "unworthy of selection" commonly withheld their names from the lottery, thereby making selection by lot vulnerable to self-selection bias and, thus, aristocratic in nature. Manin does not dwell on direct democracy's potentially aristocratic elements, perhaps because he share's Montesquieu's belief that there is nothing alarming about the exclusion of citizens who may be incompetent; this exclusion may be inevitable in any method of selection.

Additionally, Manin is interested in explaining the discrepancy between 18th century American and French revolutionaries' ''declaration'' of the "equality of all citizens" and their ''enactment'' of (aristocratic) elections in their respective democratic experiments.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Manin suggests that the discrepancy is explained by the revolutionaries' contemporary preoccupation with one form of equality over another. The revolutionaries prioritized gaining the equal right to consent to their choice of government (even a potentially aristocratic democracy), at the expense of seeking the equal right to be face of that democracy. And it is elections, not lots, that provide citizens with more opportunities to consent. In elections, citizens consent both to the procedure of elections and to the product of the elections (even if they produce the election of elites). In lotteries, citizens consent only to the procedure of lots, but not to the product of the lots (even if they produce election of the average person). That is, if the revolutionaries prioritized consent to be governed over equal opportunity to serve as the government, then their choice of elections over lotteries makes sense.

====Michels====
A major scholarly attack on the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist [[Robert Michels]] who developed the mainstream political science theory of the [[iron law of oligarchy]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="hyland"&gt;James L. Hyland. ''Democratic theory: the philosophical foundations''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Manchester University Press ND, 1995. Pp. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Michels argued that [[oligarchy]] is inevitable as an "[[iron law of oligarchy|iron law]]" within any organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" and went on to state "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a [[façade]] legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable.&lt;ref name="hyland" /&gt; Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, [[Eduoard Berth]], [[Arturo Labriola]], and [[Enrico Leone (economist)|Enrico Leone]] and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of [[social democracy]] and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=418|title=World Fascism: a Historical Encyclopedia|author=Blamires, Cyprian|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc.|year=2006|volume=1|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=418–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maurras====
[[Charles Maurras]], an FRS member of the ''[[Action française]]'' movement, stated in a famous dictum "Democracy is evil, democracy is death." Maurras' concept of ''politique naturelle'' declared recognition of inescapable biological inequality and thereby natural hierarchies, and claimed that the individual is naturally subordinated to social collectivities such as the family, the society, and the state, which he claims are doomed to fail if based upon the "myth of equality" or "abstract liberty". Maurras criticized democracy as being a "government by numbers" in which quantity matters more over quality and prefers the worst over the best. Maurras denounced the principles of [[liberalism]] as described in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and in ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as based upon the false assumption of liberty and the false assumption of equality. He claimed that the [[parliamentary system]] subordinates the national interest, or common good, to private interests of a parliament's representatives where only short-sighted interests of individuals prevail.

====Lagardelle====
French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Hubert Lagardelle]] claimed that French revolutionary syndicalism came to being as the result of "the reaction of the [[proletariat]] against democracy," which he claimed was "the ''popular form'' of [[bourgeois]] dominance." Lagardelle opposed democracy for its universalism, and believed in the necessity of class separation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, as democracy did not recognize the social differences between them.

====Shach====
Israeli politician Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] promoted [[Halakha|Judaic law]] to be the natural governance for [[Jews]] and condemned democracy, he claimed that "Democracy as a machinery of lies, false notions, pursuit of narrow interests and deceit - as opposed to the [[Torah]] regime, which is based on seeking the ultimate truth." Shach criticized democracy for having no real goals, saying "The whole point of democracy is money. The one does what the other asks him to do in pursuit of his own interest, so as to be given what he himself asks for, and the whole purpose of the transaction is that each would get what they want."

== Criticism of democracy's process ==

===Political instability===
More recently, democracy is criticized for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tend to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the mass media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priority.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7646295.stm|title=Head to head: African democracy|last=Richburg|first=Keith|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anthony Downs argued that the political market works much the same way as the economic market, and that there could potentially be an equilibrium in the system because of democratic process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he eventually argued that imperfect knowledge in politicians and voters prevented the reaching of that equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Anthony|last2=|first2=|date=April 1957|title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=65|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1086/257897|jstor=1827369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Short-termism====
Democracy is also criticised for frequent elections due to the instability of coalition governments. Coalitions are frequently formed ''after'' the elections in many countries (for example [[India]]) and the basis of alliance is predominantly to enable a viable majority, not an ideological concurrence.

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Democratic institutions work on consensus to decide an issue, which usually takes longer than a unilateral decision.

[[M. S. Golwalkar]] in his book [[Bunch of Thoughts]] describes democracy as, "is to a very large extent only a myth in practice...The high-sounding concept of "individual freedom" only meant the freedom of those talented few to exploit the rest."

====Corruption====
This is a simple form of appealing to the short term interests of the voters.

Another form is commonly called [[Pork barrel]], where local areas or political sectors are given special benefits but whose costs are spread among all [[taxpayers]].

Mere elections are just one aspect of the democratic process. Other tenets of democracy, like relative equality and freedom, are frequently absent in ostensibly democratic countries.

Moreover, in many countries, democratic participation is less than 50% at times, and it can be argued that election of individual(s) instead of ideas disrupts democracy.

==== Potential incompatibility with former politics ====
The new establishment of democratic institutions, in countries where the associated practices have as yet been uncommon or deemed culturally unacceptable, can result in institutions that are not sustainable in the long term. One circumstance supporting this outcome may be when it is part of the common perception among the populace that the institutions were established as a direct result of foreign pressure.

Sustained regular inspection from democratic countries, however effortful and well-meaning, are normally not sufficient in preventing the erosion of democratic practices. In the cases of several African countries, corruption still is rife in spite of democratically elected governments, as one of the most severe examples, Zimbabwe, is often perceived to have backfired into outright militarism.

===Efficiency of the system===
Economist Donald Wittman has written numerous works attempting to counter criticisms of democracy common among his colleagues. He argues democracy is efficient based on the premise of rational voters, competitive elections, and relatively low political transactions costs. Economist Bryan Caplan argues that, while Wittman makes strong arguments for the latter two points, the first is vitiated by the insurmountable evidence for voter irrationality. The problem is not merely the voters' lack of information, but their poor judgement. For many voters, the difficulty of learning about a particular issue is too high compared to the likely costs of ignorance, but this ignorance does not lessen their enthusiasm for voting.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Bryan. [http://econjwatch.org/articles/from-friedman-to-wittman-the-transformation-of-chicago-political-economy ''"From Friedman to Wittman: The Transformation of Chicago Political Economy"''], Econ Journal Watch, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists, such as Meltzer and Richard, have added that as industrial activity in a democracy increases, so too do the people's demands for subsidies and support from the government. By the [[median voter theorem]], only a few people actually hold the balance of power in the country, and many may be unhappy with their decisions. In this way, they argue, democracies are inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Allan H.|last2=Richard|first2=Scott F.|date=October 1981|title=A Rational Theory of the Size of Government|journal=Journal of Political Economy|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|volume=89|issue=5|pages=914–927|doi=10.1086/261013|jstor=1830813|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1749&amp;context=tepper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a system could result in a wealth disparity or racial discrimination. Fierlbeck (1998) points out that such a result is not necessarily due to a failing in the democratic process, but rather, "because democracy is responsive to the desires of a large middle class increasingly willing to disregard the muted voices of economically marginalized groups within its own borders."&lt;ref&gt;Shrag, P. (1956), "india elected anarchy." ''nehru'', 289(1734), 50-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The will of the democratic majority may not always be in the best interest of all citizens.

=== Susceptibility to propaganda ===

====Lack of political education====
{{See also|Low information voter|Low-information rationality|Deliberative democracy|Meritocracy}}
Voters may not be educated enough to exercise their democratic rights prudently. Politicians may take advantage of voters' irrationality, and compete more in the field of [[public relations]] and tactics, than in ideology. While arguments against democracy are often taken by advocates of democracy as an attempt to maintain or revive traditional hierarchy and autocratic rule, many extensions have been made to develop the argument further.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In Lipset's 1959 essay about the requirements for forming democracy, he found that almost all emerging democracies provided good education. However, education alone cannot sustain a democracy, though Caplan did note in 2005 that as people become educated, they think more like economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|last2=Lipset|first2=Seymour M.|date=June 1957|title=Political Sociology|url=http://csi.sagepub.com/content/6/2/79.extract|journal=Current Sociology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=79–99|doi=10.1177/001139215700600201|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Andrés Sepúlveda]] disclosed that he manipulated public opinion to rig elections in Latin America. According to him with a budget of $600,000 he led a team of hackers that stole campaign strategies, manipulated [[social media]] to create false waves of enthusiasm and derision, and installed [[spyware]] in opposition offices to help [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], a right-of-center candidate, win the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-hack-an-election/|title=How to Hack an Election|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/political-cyberhacker-andres-sepulveda-reveals-how-he-digitally-rigged-elections-across-latin-a6965161.html|title=Man claims he rigged elections in most Latin American countries over 8 years|date=2 April 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limited responsiveness and representation ===
Robert A. Dahl defines democracies as systems of government that respond nearly fully to each and every one of their citizens. He then poses that no such, fully responsive system exists today.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, this does not mean that ''partially'' democratic regimes do not exist—they do. Thus, Dahl rejects a democracy dichotomy in favor of a democratization spectrum. To Dahl, the question is not whether a country is a democracy or not. The question is to what extent a country is experiencing democratization at a national level. Dahl measures this democratization in terms of the country's endorsement and reception of public contestation. And polyarchy, or "rule of the many people," is the only existing form of democratizeable government; that is, it is within polyarchies that democratization can flourish. Countries do not immediately transform from hegemonies and competitive oligarchies into democracies. Instead, a country that adopts democracy as its form of government can only claim to have switched to polyarchy, which is conducive to, but does not guarantee, democratization. Dahl's polyarchy spectrum ends at the point in which a country becomes a full polyarchy at the national level and begins to democratize at the subnational level, among its social and private affairs. Dahl is not deeply concerned about the limits of his polyarchy spectrum because he believes that most countries today still have a long way before they reach full polyarchy status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Revolution? Authority in a Good Society|last=Dahl|first=Robert A.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Dahl, whatever lies beyond full polyarchy is only possible, and thus only a concern, for advanced countries like the Western Europe.

== Criticism of democracy's outcome ==

===Mob rule===
{{Main|Ochlocracy}}
[[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists 5 forms of government from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only [[Utopia|Kallipolis]], an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a [[justice|just]] form of government.

Plato rejected [[Athenian democracy]] on the basis that such democracies were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that democracies are unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such democracies were typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such democracies were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.

According to Plato, other forms of government place too much focus on lesser virtues and degenerate into other forms from best to worst, starting with [[timocracy]], which overvalues honour, then [[oligarchy]], which overvalues wealth, which is followed by democracy. In democracy, the oligarchs, or merchant, are unable to wield their power effectively and the people take over, electing someone who plays on their wishes (for example, by throwing lavish festivals). However, the government grants the people too much freedom, and the state degenerates into the fourth form, [[tyranny]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michels, Robert. [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/MicPoli.html ''Political Parties – A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy,''] Jarrold &amp; Sons. London, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oppression by the majority====
{{Further|Tyranny of the majority}}
The [[constitutions]] of many countries have parts of them that restrict the nature of the types of laws that [[legislatures]]
can pass.  A fundamental idea behind some of these restrictions, is that the majority of a population and its elected legislature can often be the source of minority persecutions, such as with [[racial discrimination]]. For example, during the mid-1930s and mid-1970s in the democratic country of Sweden, the government forcibly sterilized thousands of innocent women. They were sterilized due to "'mental defects', or simply because they were of mixed race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/Paul.Treanor/democracy.html|title=Why democracy is wrong|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second example is when, in 2014 in Pakistan, "a Christian couple were burnt alive in a brick kiln by a mob for their alleged burning of the pages of Quran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/capitalism-and-democracy-have-failed-to-protect-the-rights-of-minorities/|title=The Khilafah|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by little police retaliation and a statement from the President of Pakistan stating that his government would protect the rights and interests of the Christian community. Some countries throughout the world have judiciaries where judges can serve for long periods of time, and often serve under appointed posts. This is often balanced, however, by the fact that some trials are decided by [[juries]]. While many, like Wittman, have argued that democracies work much the same way as the free market and that there is competition among parties to prevent oppression by the majority, others have argued that there is actually very little competition among political parties in democracies due to the high cost associated with campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jlecono1&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Competition and Democracy|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|year=1958|publisher=HeinOnline|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John T. Wenders, a professor of Economics at the [[University of Idaho]], writes:

{{quote|"Freedom and democracy are different. In words attributed to Scottish historian Alexander Tytler: 'A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury.' Democracy evolves into kleptocracy. A majority bullying a minority is just as bad as a dictator, communist or otherwise, doing so. Democracy is two coyotes and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy Would Doom Hong Kong|first=John T.|last=Wenders|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|date=January 1, 1998|accessdate=April 27, 2014|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/democracy-would-doom-hong-kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, some political scientists question the notion that majority rule is an "uncontested good."&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, K. (1998) ''Globalizing Democracy: Power, Legitimacy and the Interpretation of democratic ideas.'' (p. 13) Manchester University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; If we base our critique on the definition of democracy as governance based on the will of the majority, there can be some foreseeable consequences to this form of rule. For example, Fierlbeck (1998: 12) points out that the middle class majority in a country may decide to redistribute wealth and resources into the hands of those that they feel are most capable of investing or increasing them. Of course this is only a critique of a subset of types of democracy that primarily use majority rule.

US President [[James Madison]] devoted the whole of [[Federalist No. 10]] to a scathing critique of democracy and offered that republics are a far better solution, saying: "...democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against tyranny of the majority, stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] intended to address this criticism by combining democracy with [[republicanism]]. A [[constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysongovernm01lowegoog#page/n70/mode/2up ''"Democracy and the Constitution,"''] Essays on Government, Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co. New York, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; would limit the powers of what a simple majority can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Madison]], [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa10.htm Federalist No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclical theory of government====
[[Machiavelli]] put the idea that democracies will tend to cater to the whims of the people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZzHJlvXD-YC|title=Alexis de Tocqueville and the Art of Democratic Statesmanship|last1=Danoff|first1=Brian|last2=Hebert|first2=Louie Joseph|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7391-4529-6|page=88|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who follow false ideas to entertain themselves, squander their reserves, and do not deal with potential threats to their rule until it is too late. He put forth a cyclical theory of government where monarchies tend to decay into aristocracies, which then decay into democracies, which subsequently decay into anarchy, then tyranny, then return to monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJtAAAAQBAJ|title=The Foundations of Evolutionary Institutional Economics: Generic Institutionalism|last=Wäckerle|first=Manuel|date=August 15, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-81076-0|page=302|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVZ3TjL0-UC|title=Models of Democracy|last=Held|first=David|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754729|page=40|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the timeline of France before, during, and after the Revolution until the last Bourbon Monarch.

However Machiavelli's definition of democracy was narrower than the current one. He hypothesized that a hybrid system of government incorporating facets of all three major types (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) could break this cycle. Many modern democracies that have [[separation of powers]] are claimed to represent these kinds of hybrid governments. However, in modern democracies there is usually no direct correlation with Machiavelli's idea, because of weakening of the separation of powers, or erosion of the original function of the various branches. For example, the modern United States executive branch has slowly accumulated more power from the legislative branch, and the Senate no longer functions as a quasi-aristocratic body as was originally intended, since senators are now democratically elected.

===Political Coase theorem===
Some have tried to argue that the [[Coase theorem]] applies to political markets as well. [[Daron Acemoglu]], however, provides evidence to the contrary, claiming that the Coase Theorem is only valid while there are "rules of the game," so to speak, that are being enforced by the government. But when there is nobody there to enforce the rules for the government itself, there is no way to guarantee that low transaction costs will lead to an efficient outcome in democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|authorlink=Daron Acemoglu|date=2003|title=Why Not A Political Coase Theorem? Social Conflict, Commitment, And Politics|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=31|issue=4|pages=620–652|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2003.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIBA Women's World Ranking''' is the [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national women's [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

==Calculation==
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events' weights===
FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition ranking points===
[[File:FIFA World Rankings for Women.png|thumb|300px|Map of FIBA World Ranking for women]]
As opposed to [[Association football|football]] tournaments, teams still have to go through a series of consolation and classification rounds even if they've been eliminated from title contention, so that a complete ranking of the teams will be possible.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

The calculations are done after the tournaments stated above in a group of two Olympic cycles (8 years). The oldest tournament outside the 8-year period is discarded and replaced with the newest competition.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

This means that in every computation, there are:
* Four continental championships
* Two [[FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup]]s
* Two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournaments]]

===Example===
The {{wnbt|United States}}' 1000.0 points were calculated by this method:

The '''FIBA World Rankings''' or '''NIKE-FIBA World Rankings''' are [[FIBA]]'s rankings of national [[basketball]] teams. FIBA ranks men's and women's national teams in both senior and junior competitions. It also publishes combined rankings for all competitions involving both sexes.

Not included are rankings for 3x3, which are tabulated for individual players.

==Calculation==
Only FIBA tournaments for full five-a-side teams are used in calculations for the tournaments. Other tournaments, such as regional championships, invitationals, and friendlies are not included. Also not counted are tournaments in FIBA's official competition for three-on-three halfcourt basketball, [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]].&lt;ref name="how"&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/openNodeIDs/998/selNodeID/998/howItWork.html FIBA.com: How it works]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, FIBA radically changed its ranking system for men's national teams, switching from the previous competition-based system to a game-based system. Every game played by a national team within the prior 8 years in the World Cup, Olympics, continental championships, and qualifiers for these events figures into the calculations.&lt;ref name="How men"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/howitworks |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike — How it works |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Olympic Games 2016 the Olympic game and the men's world championship, gave identical score for being a world champion and Olympic, but since the new FIBA score emerged in 2017 these two tournaments devalued the score, passing from 5 points play an Olympic and world championship as it was until 2016, to award 2.5 points for playing a world championship, and 2 points for playing an Olympic game of basketball since 2017. Therefore, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to others tournaments of National Teams, as they did in the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic, but if there was much difference until 2016 in fiba ranking points between these two tournaments and the rest of the competitions fiba as the continental tournaments. In the women will continue maintaining the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world game. But since 2017 will no longer keep the same score men.

===Rating points per game===
Each game in a ranking tournament is initially valued at 1,000 '''basis points''', divided between the two teams as follows:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Victory margin !! Points to winner !! Points to loser
|-
| Less than 10 points || 600 || 400
|-
| 10–19 points || 700 || 300
|-
| 20 or more points || 800 || 200
|-
| Forfeit || 1000 || 0
|}

The basis points are adjusted based on the site of the game, with FIBA calling this adjustment '''home/away points'''. During the finals of ranking tournaments, only games played by a host team in its own country count as "home" games; all others are treated as neutral-site games. Adjustments are:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

* Home game: −70 points
* Neutral site: No adjustment
* Away game: +70 points

The basis points are also adjusted to reflect the strength of the opponent. FIBA determines what it calls '''opposition ranking points''' by the following formula:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

* Opposition ranking points = 1.5 × (average pregame ranking for all national teams − opponent's pregame ranking)

A team's final rating points for a particular game is the '''sum''' of basis, home/away, and opposition ranking points.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

===Weighting===
The new calculations still account for the specific tournament and region, as in the former procedure, but no longer explicitly consider a team's final tournament placement.

In a new feature, a '''time decay''' factor has been introduced into the calculations. More recent games carry the greatest weight, steadily declining until falling out of the calculations after 8 years:&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Time of game !! Weighting 
|-
| Current year (Y) and immediately previous year (Y−1) || 1.0
|-
| Y−2 and Y−3 || 0.75
|-
| Y−4 and Y−5 || 0.5
|-
| Y−6 and Y−7 || 0.25
|}

'''Regional''' weighting remains in the system, though the specific factors vary from those used in the past men's rankings: Until the men Olympic Games 2016, the Olympic games and the men's world championship gave identical score for being a world champion and Olympic, but since the new FIBA rakning fiba emerged in 2017 these two tournaments devalued the score, passing from 5 points play an Olympic and world championship as it was until 2016, to award 2.5 points for playing a world championship, and 2 points for playing an Olympic game of basketball since 2017. Therefore, both tournaments will not grant a differential score with respect to others tournaments of national teams, as they did in the past where there was no difference in points in the ranking for being world champion or Olympic, but if there was much difference until 2016 in fiba ranking points between these two tournaments,  and the rest of the competitions fiba as the continental tournaments. In the women will continue maintaining the score of 5 points for playing an Olympic or world championship. but since 2017 will no longer keep the same ranking men.

FIBA uses a [[weighted arithmetic mean]] to determine the statistical weight of each of the tournaments. Each event is assigned point weight that is based partly on how competitive the tournament is and partly on which national teams are participating:.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; There were constant changes in the system of the FIBA ranking, but it can be seen that until 2016 the FIBA world championship and the games awarded the same points in the FIBA ranking, therefore the FIBA world championship and the Olympic basketball games had the same value. Therefore, for those years the World Cup and the Olympic tournament had the same prestige according to the ranking of those years. In the year 2017, according to the ranking system in the FIBA ranking, published on October 11, 2017 for the first time in history, the FIBA world championship awards more points than the Olympic tournament: 2.5 points the world championship, against 2 points the olympics games. For all this the FIBA 2019 world championship will be the first more prestigious championship than an Olympic basketball, given that it will be worth 2.5 points and the Olympic 2020, 2 points.

The 2017 FIBA ranking started on October 11, 2017. Since that date, the FIBA World Cup is worth 2.5 and the Olympic Games 2 points, although the new ranking  published on October 11, 2017 is not applicable to the tournaments played until 2016, given that both tournaments they maintain the same score (5 each one).

In the future, the World Cup will be worth 2.5 points and the Olympic basketball tournament 2 points, therefore in 2019 for the first time in history the FIBA World Cup will give more points than an Olympic basketball game.

In addition to the qualifying rounds, in Europe are also included the results of the [[FIBA European Championship for Small Countries]].

|-
| [[FIBA Asia Cup]] || 0.4
|-
| [[EuroBasket]] || 1.0
|-
| [[FIBA Oceania Championship]] || 0.7
|}

From 2017 forward, FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania members compete for a single regional championship under the FIBA Asia banner. Results from the 2010–2016 period, during which FIBA Asia and FIBA Oceania held separate championships, will continue to figure into the rankings until results from 2016, the final year of separate championships in the two regions, drop from the calculations in 2025.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

In a new feature, FIBA also weights game results by the '''competition stage'''.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage !! Weight
|-
| Pre-qualifier || 0.25
|-
| Qualifier || 0.5
|-
| Final tournament || 1.0
|}

Additionally, FIBA has added a '''round weighting''' to the system, giving each game in a final tournament (World Cup, Olympics, or continental championship) a weighting based on the round in which it takes place. Qualifying matches for these tournaments implicitly carry a round weighting of 1.0.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Round !! Weight
|-
| Group stage || 1.0
|-
| Round of 16 || 1.25
|-
| Quarterfinals || 1.5
|-
| Semifinals || 1.75
|-
| Final || 2.0
|}

If a competition does not have a round of 16 and/or a quarterfinal round, the results from the rounds that are held are scaled according to the number of rounds, with the group stage remaining at a 1.0 weighting and the competition final remaining at 2.0.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

The final weighting is the '''product''' of the time decay, regional, competition stage, and round weights.&lt;ref name="How men"/&gt;

===Cycle and updates===
Rankings are now updated after every individual game in a ranking tournament (including qualifiers for such tournaments).

===Examples===
For examples of the new ranking calculations, see [http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/examples this page] on FIBA's official site.

==Women's rankings==
{{Main|FIBA Women's World Ranking}}
FIBA still uses the competition-based system to determine its women's rankings. As noted above, this system was also used to determine men's rankings prior to 2017. FIBA has announced that it will introduce a game-based ranking procedure similar to that currently used for men's rankings in the indeterminate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/documents/rankingmen/faq |title=FIBA World Ranking Men, presented by Nike – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=FIBA |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==

* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues. GPoT Center published its first two books on Cyprus issue in the summer 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.cc/index.php/lang/en/cat/2/news/50924 BRT: Rauf Denktash and Michael Moran write a book]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then published other books on developments in Cyprus, Israeli-Turkish relations, as well as [[democratization]] of the [[Middle East]].

== Partners and Networks ==

The Center cooperates with institutions from [[Sweden]] - SIIA, [[Lebanon]] - CAUS, [[Qatar]] - ADF, [[United Kingdom]] - LSE, [[Czech Republic]] - EUROPEUM, [[Slovak Republic]] - SFPA, [[Armenia]] - EPF, YPC and Internews, [[Egypt]] - Ibn-Khaldun Center, and [[France]] - ENS. GPoT Center is also part of larger research and academic networks such as the United Nations's [[Alliance of Civilizations]], International Research and Security Network, [[United Nations]]' Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures.

The '''''Gascony Show''''' is an English-language radio [[chat show]] aired in the southwest of France and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]]&lt;ref name=radiocoteaux1774922&gt;[http://www.radiocoteaux.com/emissionsthematiques.php "Emissions thématiques sur le site officiel de radio coteaux, frequences 104.4 et 97.7 FM"] By Patrick Martinez, Radio Coteaux&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Gascony]] region. The show is presented by Irishman John Slattery.

==The show==
[[File:John Slattery Gascony Show.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Slattery, the Gascony Show host in the radio studio.|''The Gascony Show'' host, John Slattery, in the studio in Saint Blancard]]
John Slattery takes over the airwaves at 5pm and finishes at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. The ''Gascony Show'' is a music-based programme that includes light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the host. Listeners' views and comments are discussed and there are rotating segments such as "Song of The Week" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big "Bag O Topics."

Podcasts of all previous shows&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5436793&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/podcasts/GasconyShowPodcasts.xml "The Gascony Show Podcasts"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt; are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5434434&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/the-gascony-show/id455503319 "The Gascony Show on iTunes"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invited guests==

The show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests,&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2334923&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/archives.html "The Gascony Show Archives"] Recorded shows with guests.&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2345213&gt;[http://web.me.com/claire.jefferson/StellaWulf/StopPress.html "Stella Wulf, News &amp; Events"] Interview, Sunday, 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stella is the author of "The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales," "Rum Rhymes and Vagabond" and "The Song of the Froom." She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.

Subsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew.&lt;ref name=pkmediapromotions6456442&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMediaPromotions "The Gascony Show Channel"] Produced by PK Media Promotions.&lt;/ref&gt; These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of [[Peter Gabriel]] and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

A highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding,&lt;ref name=leaffielding5437658&gt;[http://www.leaffielding.com/news.html "Leaf Fielding on the Gascony Show"] Interview, Sunday, 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called [[Operation Julie]]. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book ''To Live Outside The Law'',&lt;ref name=leaffielding1116349&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/07/leaf-fielding-outside-law-drugs "To Live Outside The Law"] By The Guardian, Thursday, 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.

==Regular contributors==

The show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local [[expatriates]] living in the Gascony region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; study, now called GBD 1990.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was "institutionalized" at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the research was "conducted mainly by researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and WHO".&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt;

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

The WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in ''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' (published in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Global health risks'' (published in 2009).&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_Front.pdf |title=''Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks'' |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,&lt;ref name="Lancet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt;

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&amp;pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News &amp; Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and [[total fertility rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1980%E2%80%932015 |title=Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 1980–2015 |website=GHDx |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/there-s-a-new-ranking-of-the-healthiest-countries-how-is-yours-doing/ |title=There's a new ranking of the healthiest countries.

The '''Global Landscapes Forum''' ('''GLF''') is a knowledge-led multi-stakeholder forum dedicated to promoting the [[Integrated landscape management|landscape approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/recognizing-common-ground-finding-meaning-in-integrated-landscape-management/ |title=Recognizing Common Ground: Finding Meaning in Integrated Landscape Management |last1=Friedman |first1=Rachel |last2=Shames |first2=Seth |last3=Sherr |first3=Sara |date=November 13, 2013 |website=EcoAgriculture Partners |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GLF is the largest knowledge-led platform on sustainable land use. Since 2013, over 3,900 organizations and 150,000 people have taken part in Forum events in person and online. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globallandscapesforum.org/about/what-is-glf|title=What is the Global Landscapes Forum? - Global Landscapes Forum|work=Global Landscapes Forum|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by the [[Center for International Forestry Research]] (CIFOR).

== History ==
The inaugural GLF event took place alongside to [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP 19) in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/11/17/1256032/-Warsaw-Global-Landscape-Forum-Lanches-Alongside-COP19 |title=Warsaw: Global Landscape Forum Launches Alongside COP19 |last=Phelan |first=Deborah |date=November 17, 2013 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It heralded the merger of [[International Day of Forests|Forest Day]] and [[Agriculture and Rural Development Day]], reflecting a scientific climate that favored breaking down research silos and utilizing an integrated landscape approach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/11958/forest-day-time-to-move-on|title=Forest Day – time to move on|date=2012-12-02|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four major GLF events were held annually on the sidelines of the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

Following a major funding injection from the German government, the GLF moved to establish a [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] in [[Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.globallandscapesforum.org/glf-marrakesh/pressroom/cop22-german-government-supports-establishment-global-landscapes-forum-bonn/|title=COP22: German government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn - 2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|work=2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of an effort on the part of the German government and the city of Bonn to establish a "sustainability cluster" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonn-international.org/international-profile/sustainability-cluster.html|title=Sustainability cluster - Bonn International|website=www.bonn-international.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==

CIFOR serves as the implementing organization of the GLF, and the current coordinating partners are the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

As of 2017, the host country partners are the German [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) and [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cifor.org/corporate-news/german-government-pledges-commitment-global-landscapes-forum-promote-research-connect-results-communities-ground/|title=German Government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn|work=Center for International Forestry Research|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== Predecessor Events ===
Following a move towards more integrated landscape approaches in both the [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]] sides of the research for [[Development aid|development]] sphere, the Global Landscapes Forum was born out of a merger of [[Global Landscapes Forum#Forest Day|Forest Day]] and [[Global Landscapes Forum#Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD)|Agriculture and Rural Development Day]] (ARDD), both of which were formerly long-standing side events at the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] (COP).

==== Forest Day  ====
{{Main|International Day of Forests}}
Forest Day was an annual COP side event co-organized by CIFOR and the [[Collaborative Partnership on Forests]], since the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP13) in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2012, by resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on November 28, 2012, Forest Day became the [[International Day of Forests]].&lt;ref name=declaration&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/36014-063ec88fa19cab1dfe473d7813290b32.pdf "International Day of Forests,"] United Nations General Assembly, November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sixth and final Forest Day was held on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

====Agriculture and Rural Development Day ====
{{Main|Agriculture and Rural Development Day}}
Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD) was an annual COP side event. The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5 (ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the COP18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Events ===
The first major GLF event took place in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] during the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/19350/a-sustainable-development-goal-on-landscapes-setting-the-agenda-at-cop19-in-warsaw|title=A Sustainable Development Goal on Landscapes: Setting the agenda at COP19 in Warsaw|date=2013-10-04|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the major injection of funding from the German government during the [[Global Landscapes Forum#Marrakesh 2016: Climate Action for Sustainable Development|Marrakesh event]], the GLF moved to establish a more permanent presence in Bonn, Germany. While the [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP23) was held in Bonn the same year from November 6–17, 2017, the Global Landscapes Forum event took place just over a month later on December 19–20, 2017. This marked the first year that the GLF existed as its own entity and not as a COP side event. For the first time, the [[Wangari Maathai#Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award|Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award]] was presented at the GLF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpfweb.org/93397/en/|title=Collaborative Partnership on Forests|last=Nations|first=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|website=www.cpfweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic Events ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress19-2.htm
|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28

|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415002147/http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|archivedate=15 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers notes the existence of [[stateless persons]], whom he remarks ought to be the primary candidates for global citizenship, yet continue to live without access to basic freedoms and citizenship rights.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers does not oppose the concept of global citizenship, however he criticizes potential implications of the term depending on one's definition of it, such as ones that provide support for the "ruthlessly capitalist economic system that now dominates the planet."&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; Byers states that global citizenship is a "powerful term"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; because "people that invoke it do so to provoke and justify action,"&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt; and encourages the attendees of his lecture to re-appropriate it in order for its meaning to have a positive purpose, based on idealistic values.&lt;ref name="Byers1"/&gt;

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;— notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;— or held in common&amp;nbsp;— notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998). ''The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Pubs. {{ISBN|978-90-411-0505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669–693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704–1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn, Michael (1998). "The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research."  ''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making – Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change in the Arctic region is leading to widespread ecosystem restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Footprints of climate change in the Arctic marine ecosystem. |author=Wassmann, P. |journal=Global Change Biology |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1235–1249 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02311.x |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2011GCBio..17.1235W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[Kármán line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the Bogotá Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.whatitcosts.com/facts-space-station.htm|title=How Much the International Space Station (ISS) Cost to Build|author=|date=14 April 2016|website=whatitcosts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000. Discours de la ministre sur les priorite´s de la pre´sidence franc¸aise dans le domaine de l’environnement devant la commission environnement—consommation—sante´du parlement europe´en, 6 juillet 2000, Strasbourg’, French Presidency of the EU [online] Available at: www.presidence-europe.fr [Accessed 03 November 2011]. and Kohl, H. et al., 1997. Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015. [http://e-publications.une.edu.au/1959.11/18560 ''Fixing global governance''], Online Opinion, 29 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''global recession''' is [[recession]] that affects many countries around the world—that is, a period of global economic slowdown or declining economic output.

== Definitions ==
The [[International Monetary Fund]] defines a global recession as "a decline in annual per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP ([[purchasing power parity]] weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per{{nbhyph}}capita investment, and per{{nbhyph}}capita consumption".&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What’s a Global Recession?|publisher=The Walstreet Journal|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf|title=World Economic Outlook - April 2009: Crisis and Recovery|format=PDF|work=Box 1.1 (page 11-14)|publisher=IMF|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this definition, since [[World War II]] there were only four global recessions (in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009), all of them only lasting a year (although the 1991 recession would have lasted until 1993 if the IMF had used normal exchange rate weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP rather than the [[purchasing power parity]] weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP).&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt; The 2009 global recession, also known as the [[Great Recession]], was by far the worst of the four postwar recessions, both in terms of the number of countries affected and the decline in real World GDP per capita.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt;

Before April 2009, the IMF argued that a global annual [[real GDP]] growth rate of 3.0 percent or less was "equivalent to a global recession".&lt;ref name="economist-12381879"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381879 |title=The world economy Bad, or worse |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lall, Subir.

== Overview ==
Informally, a national [[recession]] is a period of declining economic output. In a 1974 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, [[Julius Shiskin]] suggested several [[rules of thumb]] to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), a measure of the nation's output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Achuthan |first=Lakshman |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/05/news/economy/recession/index.htm |title=The risk of redefining recession, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, Economic Cycle Research Institute, May 7, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but not the United States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUUg6ckAsM5U&amp;refer=hom Japan's Economy Shrinks 0.4%, Confirming Recession]
By Jason Clenfield&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a national recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a '''global recession''' is more difficult, because a [[Developing country]] is expected to have a higher GDP growth than a [[Developed country]].&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/update/03/index.htm |title=IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update - Rapidly Weakening Prospects Call for New Policy Stimulus - November 2008 |publisher=Imf.org |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and [[Liquidity risk|liquidity problems]]. Countries in [[East Asia]] (including [[China]]) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03" /&gt;

The IMF estimates that global recessions occur over a cycle lasting between eight and ten years. During what the IMF terms the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=arlKrFbn3pfY&amp;refer=home|title=Global Recession Risk Grows as U.S. `Damage' Spreads.

States), the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (Germany), ''[[O Globo]]'' (Brazil), ''[[Le Monde]]'' (France), ''[[L'espresso]]'' (Italy), ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' (the Netherlands), ''[[Dagbladet]]'' (Norway), ''[[El País]]'' (Spain), and [[Sveriges Television]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSA Primary Sources |url=https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/nsadocs |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These media reports have shed light on the implications of several [[Secret treaty|secret treaties]] signed by members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA community]] in their efforts to implement [[global surveillance]]. For example, ''Der Spiegel'' revealed how the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] (BND) transfers "massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA",&lt;ref name="spiegelsendnsa"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Hubert Gude |author2=Laura Poitras |author3=Marcel Rosenbach |title=German intelligence Sends Massive Amounts of Data to the NSA |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Swedish Television revealed the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|National Defence Radio Establishment]] (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its [[diplomatic cable|cable collection]], under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gunnar Rensfeldt |title=NSA 'asking for' specific exchanges from FRA – Secret treaty since 1954 |url=http://www.svt.se/ug/nsafra4 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |quote=This document, dated 18 April of this year, clearly shows that the relation is very close indeed, seemingly growing even closer.

The NSA was also getting data directly from [[telecommunications companies]] codenamed Artifice, Lithium, Serenade, SteelKnight, and X. The real identities of the companies behind these codenames were not included in the Snowden document dump because they were protected as [[Exceptionally Controlled Information]] which prevents wide circulation even to those (like Snowden) who otherwise have the necessary security clearance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecisnowden&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=Dominic Rushe |title=Snowden document reveals key role of companies in NSA data collection |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-data-collection-tech-firms |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSA gained massive amounts of information captured from the monitored data traffic in Europe. For example, in December 2013, the NSA gathered on an average day metadata from some 15 million telephone connections and 10 million Internet datasets.

{{quote|The [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] has been working to influence the German government to relax interpretation of the privacy laws to provide greater opportunities of intelligence sharing.&lt;ref name=spiegelbnd500meta /&gt;}}

According to an NSA document dated April 2013, Germany has now become the NSA's "most prolific partner".&lt;ref name=spiegelbnd500meta /&gt; Under a section of a separate document leaked by Snowden titled "Success Stories", the NSA acknowledged the efforts of the German government to expand the BND's international data sharing with partners:

In addition, the German government was well aware of the PRISM surveillance program long before Edward Snowden made details public.

Under that law, the target must be a foreigner "reasonably believed" to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or "foreign powers." The FISC extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' jointly reported that the NSA and GCHQ had made repeated attempts to spy on anonymous Internet users who have been communicating in secret via the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. Several of these surveillance operations involved the implantation of malicious code into the computers of Tor users who visit particular websites. The NSA and GCHQ had partly succeeded in blocking access to the anonymous network, diverting Tor users to insecure channels. The government agencies were also able to uncover the identity of some anonymous Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Secret NSA documents show campaign against Tor encrypted network |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secret-nsa-documents-show-campaign-against-tor-encrypted-network/2013/10/04/610f08b6-2d05-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2013 |author1=Barton Gellman |author2=Craig Timberg |author3=Steven Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA slideshow on 'The TOR problem' |url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-slideshow-on-the-tor-problem/499/ |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2013 |author1=Steven Rich |author2=Matt DeLong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Timothy B. |title=Everything you need to know about the NSA and Tor in one FAQ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nsa-and-tor-in-one-faq/ |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA report on the Tor encrypted network |url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/nsa-research-report-on-the-tor-encryption-program/501/ |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GCHQ report on 'MULLENIZE' program to 'stain' anonymous electronic traffic |url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/gchq-report-on-mullenize-program-to-stain-anonymous-electronic-traffic/502/ |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA and GCHQ target Tor network that protects anonymity of web users |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 4, 2013 |author1=James Ball |author2=Bruce Schneier |author3=Glenn Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |title=Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Tor Stinks' presentation – read the full document |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tor: 'The king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly sensitive signals intelligence collection program known as [[Stateroom (surveillance program)|Stateroom]] involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic. It is operated out of the diplomatic missions of the [[UKUSA Agreement|Five Eyes]] (Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, United States) in numerous locations around the world. The program conducted at U.S. diplomatic missions is run in concert by the U.S. intelligence agencies NSA and CIA in a joint venture group called "[[Special Collection Service]]" (SCS), whose members work undercover in shielded areas of the American Embassies and Consulates, where they are officially accredited as diplomats and as such enjoy special privileges. Under diplomatic protection, they are able to look and listen unhindered. The SCS for example used the American Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to monitor communications in Germany's government district with its parliament and the seat of the government.&lt;ref name="Spiegel20131027"&gt;{{cite news |title=Der Spiegel Cover Story: How NSA Spied on Merkel Cell Phone from Berlin Embassy – Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=October 27, 2013 |author=Jacob Appelbaum, Nikolaus Blome, Hubert Gude, Ralf Neukirch, René Pfister, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Jörg Schindler, Gregor Peter Schmitz and Holger Stark.

''The New York Times'' reported that the NSA carries out an eavesdropping effort, dubbed Operation Dreadnought, against the Iranian leader [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. During his 2009 visit to [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the agency collaborated with GCHQ and the U.S.'s [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], collecting radio transmissions between aircraft and airports, examining Khamenei's convoy with satellite imagery, and enumerating military radar stations. According to the story, an objective of the operation is "communications fingerprinting": the ability to distinguish Khamenei's communications from those of other people in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="omnivore"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/world/no-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html?pagewanted=all |title=No Morsel Too Minuscule for All-Consuming N.S.A. |work=The New York Times |date=November 2, 2013 |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |author=Shane, Scott |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F11%2F03%2Fworld%2Fno-morsel-too-minuscule-for-all-consuming-nsa.html%3Fpagewanted%3D7%26_r%3D2%26pagewanted%3Dall&amp;date=2013-11-25 |archivedate=November 25, 2013 |quote=This "communications fingerprinting," as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does.

The same story revealed an operation code-named Ironavenger, in which the NSA intercepted e-mails sent between a country allied with the United States and the government of "an adversary". The ally was conducting a [[spear-phishing]] attack: its e-mails contained [[malware]]. The NSA gathered documents and [[login]] credentials belonging to the enemy country, along with knowledge of the ally's capabilities for [[Cyberwarfare|attacking computers]].&lt;ref name="omnivore" /&gt;

According to the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', the British intelligence agency GCHQ maintains a listening post on the roof of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin|British Embassy in Berlin]] that is capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications all over the German capital, including adjacent government buildings such as the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] (seat of the German parliament) and the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] (seat of Germany's head of government) clustered around the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |title=Revealed: Britain's 'secret listening post in the heart of Berlin' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-britains-secret-listening-post-in-the-heart-of-berlin-8921548.html |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |newspaper=The Independent |date=November 5, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a secret deal approved by British intelligence officials, the NSA has been storing and analyzing the internet and email records of UK citizens since 2007. The NSA also proposed in 2005 a procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other [[UKUSA Agreement|Five-Eyes nations alliance]], even where the partner government has explicitly denied the U.S. permission to do so. Under the proposal, partner countries must neither be informed about this particular type of surveillance, nor the procedure of doing so.&lt;ref name="ukusaball"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=James |title=US and UK struck secret deal to allow NSA to 'unmask' Britons' personal data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data |accessdate=November 21, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The culture of compliance, which has allowed the American people to entrust NSA with extraordinary authorities, will not be compromised in the face of so many demands, even as we aggressively pursue legal authorities...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Strategy for Surveillance Powers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/11/23/us/politics/23nsa-sigint-strategy-document.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 23, 2013 |date=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The report, titled "[[signals intelligence|SIGINT]] Strategy 2012–2016", also said that the U.S. will try to influence the "global commercial encryption market" through "commercial relationships", and emphasized the need to "revolutionize" the analysis of its vast data collection to "radically increase operational impact".&lt;ref name="nytimessignt2016" /&gt;

On November 23, 2013, the Dutch newspaper ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' reported that the Netherlands was targeted by U.S. intelligence agencies in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]].

According to the classified documents leaked by Snowden, the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] (ASD), formerly known as the Defence Signals Directorate, had offered to share intelligence information it had collected with the other intelligence agencies of the [[UKUSA Agreement]]. Data shared with foreign countries include "bulk, unselected, unminimised metadata" it had collected. The ASD provided such information on the condition that no Australian citizens were targeted. At the time the ASD assessed that "unintentional collection [of metadata of Australian nationals] is not viewed as a significant issue". If a target was later identified as being an Australian national, the ASD was required to be contacted to ensure that a warrant could be sought. Consideration was given as to whether "medical, legal or religious information" would be automatically treated differently to other types of data, however a decision was made that each agency would make such determinations on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=guardian031213&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=James Ball |author3=Katharine Murphy |title=Revealed: Australian spy agency offered to share data about ordinary citizens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/revealed-australian-spy-agency-offered-to-share-data-about-ordinary-citizens |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaked material does not specify where the ASD had collected the intelligence information from, however Section 7(a) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (Commonwealth) states that the ASD's role is "...to obtain intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligence Services Act 2001 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00114/Html/Text#_Toc442430744 |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is possible ASD's metadata intelligence holdings was focused on foreign intelligence collection and was within the bounds of Australian law.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that the NSA has been tracking the locations of mobile phones from all over the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. In the process of doing so, the NSA collects more than five billion records of phone locations on a daily basis.

The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies.

According to ''The New York Times'', the NSA is monitoring approximately 100,000 computers worldwide with spy software named Quantum. Quantum enables the NSA to conduct surveillance on those computers on the one hand, and can also create a digital highway for launching cyberattacks on the other hand. Among the targets are the Chinese and Russian military, but also trade institutions within the European Union. The NYT also reported that the NSA can access and alter computers which are not connected with the internet by a secret technology in use by the NSA since 2008. The prerequisite is the physical insertion of the radio frequency hardware by a spy, a manufacturer or an unwitting user.  The technology relies on a covert channel of radio waves that can be transmitted from tiny circuit boards and USB cards inserted surreptitiously into the computers. In some cases, they are sent to a briefcase-size relay station that intelligence agencies can set up miles away from the target. The technology can also transmit malware back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name="NYT20140114" /&gt;

[[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' revealed the existence of [[Dishfire]], a massive [[database]] of the NSA that collects hundreds of millions of text messages on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA 'collected 200&amp;nbsp;m texts per day' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25770313 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCHQ has been given full access to the database, which it uses to obtain personal information of Britons by exploiting a legal loophole.&lt;ref name="c4database"&gt;{{cite web |last=Geoff White |title=Revealed: UK and US spied on text messages of Brits |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/intercept-text-messages-spy-nsa-gchq-british-phone |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each day, the database receives and stores the following amounts of data:
* [[Geolocation]] data of more than 76,000 text messages and other travel information&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;
* Over 110,000 names, gathered from electronic [[business card]]s&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;

* Over 5 million [[missed call]] alerts&lt;ref name="guardiandishfire" /&gt;
* About 200 million text messages from around the world&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

A 2008 GCHQ report, leaked by Snowden asserts that "anyone using [[Google Maps]] on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system". The NSA and GCHQ have traded recipes for various purposes such as grabbing location data and journey plans that are made when a target uses [[Google Maps]], and vacuuming up [[address book]]s, [[Contact list|buddy lists]], [[Call logging|phone logs]] and geographic data embedded in photos posted on the mobile versions of numerous social networks such as Facebook, [[Flickr]], [[LinkedIn]], Twitter and other services. In a separate 20-page report dated 2012, GCHQ cited the popular smartphone game "[[Angry Birds]]" as an example of how an application could be used to extract user data. Taken together, such forms of data collection would allow the agencies to collect vital information about a user's life, including his or her home country, current location (through [[geolocation]]), age, gender, [[ZIP code]], [[marital status]], income, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]], education level, number of children, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ball |first=James |title=NSA and GCHQ target 'leaky' phone apps like Angry Birds to scoop user data |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=James Glanz |author2=Jeff Larson |author3=Andrew W.

The [[Communications Security Establishment Canada]] (CSEC) has been tracking Canadian air passengers via free [[Wi-Fi]] services at a major Canadian airport. Passengers who exited the airport terminal continued to be tracked as they showed up at other [[Wi-Fi]] locations across Canada. In a CSEC document dated May 2012, the agency described how it had gained access to two communications systems with over 300,000 users in order to pinpoint a specific imaginary target. The operation was executed on behalf of the NSA as a trial run to test a new technology capable of tracking down "any target that makes occasional forays into other cities/regions."

According to research by ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and TV network [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] the mobile phone of former German chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] was monitored from 2002 onwards, reportedly because of his government's opposition to [[Iraq War|military intervention in Iraq]]. The source of the latest information is a document leaked by Edward Snowden. The document, containing information about the National Sigint Requirement List (NSRL), had previously been interpreted as referring only to [[Angela Merkel]]'s mobile. However ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' and NDR claim to have confirmation from NSA insiders that the surveillance authorisation pertains not to the individual, but the political post – which in 2002 was still held by Schröder. According to research by the two media outlets, Schröder was placed as number 388 on the list, which contains the names of persons and institutions to be put under surveillance by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA hatte auch Gerhard Schröder im Visier |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausspaehung-des-bundeskanzlers-nsa-hatte-auch-gerhard-schroeder-im-visier-1.1880004 |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=February 4, 2014 |author=Stefan Kornelius, Hans Leyendecker und Georg Mascolo |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ottermann |first=Philip |title=NSA tapped German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder's phone – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/04/us-nsa-gerhard-schroeder-surveillance |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 4, 2014 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: NSA spied on Merkel's predecessor too |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |work=Associated Press (AP) |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |date=February 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205020031/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/world/article/Report-NSA-spied-on-Merkel-s-predecessor-too-5204068.php |archivedate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smale |first=Alison |title=German Paper Says U.S. Kept Tabs on Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/europe/german-paper-says-us-kept-tabs-on-leader.html |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== March ====
The NSA has built an infrastructure which enables it to covertly hack into computers on a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human oversight in the process. The NSA relies on an automated system codenamed [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]] which in essence enables the automated management and control of a large network of implants (a form of remotely transmitted malware on selected individual computer devices or in bulk on tens of thousands of devices). As quoted by ''The Intercept'', TURBINE is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated control implants by groups instead of individually."&lt;ref name="TC20140312"&gt;{{cite news |title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014 |author=Ryan Gallagher and Greenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA has shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance – the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

Among other things due to TURBINE and its control over the implants the NSA is capable of:

* breaking into targeted computers and to siphoning out data from foreign Internet and phone networks
* infecting a target's computer and exfiltrating files from a hard drive
* covertly recording audio from a computer's microphone and taking snapshots with its webcam
* launching cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites
* exfiltrating data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer

The TURBINE implants are linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine surveillance "sensors" that the NSA has installed at locations across the world, including the agency's headquarters in Maryland and eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith Hill, England. Codenamed as TURMOIL, the sensors operate as a sort of high-tech surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent across the Internet. When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems, the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the initiation of a malware attack. To identify surveillance targets, the NSA uses a series of data "selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors can include email addresses, IP addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter, unique Google advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or updates.&lt;ref name="TC20140312" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Ryan |title=Compare the NSA's Facebook Malware Denial to its Own Secret Documents |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/15/nsa-facebook-malware-turbine-non-denial-denial/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |title=NSA's automated hacking engine offers hands-free pwning of the world |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/ |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |publisher=Ars Technica |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Industrial-Scale Exploitation |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/industrial-scale-exploitation/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Technology Directorate Analysis of Converged Data |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-technology-directorate-analysis-converged-data/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There Is More Than One Way to Quantum |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/one-way-quantum/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NSA Phishing Tactics and Man in the Middle Attacks |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-phishing-tactics-man-middle-attacks/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quantum Insert Diagrams |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/quantum-insert-diagrams/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TURBINE and TURMOIL |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/turbine-turmoil/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The NSA and GCHQ's QUANTUMTHEORY Hacking Tactics |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/nsa-gchqs-quantumtheory-hacking-tactics/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Menwith Hill Station Leverages XKeyscore for Quantum Against Yahoo and Hotmail |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/menwith-hill-station-leverages-xkeyscore-quantum-yahoo-hotmail/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five Eyes Hacking Large Routers |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/five-eyes-hacking-large-routers/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selector Types |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/selector-types/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VPN and VOIP Exploitation With HAMMERCHANT and HAMMERSTEIN |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/vpn-voip-exploitation-hammerchant-hammerstein/ |accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Implants |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/03/12/thousands-implants/ |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |newspaper=The Intercept |date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish newspaper ''Dagbladet Information'' and ''The Intercept'' revealed on June 19, 2014, the NSA mass surveillance program codenamed [[RAMPART-A]]. Under RAMPART-A, 'third party' countries tap into fiber optic cables carrying the majority of the world's electronic communications and are secretly allowing the NSA to install surveillance equipment on these fiber-optic cables. The foreign partners of the NSA turn massive amounts of data like the content of phone calls, faxes, e-mails, internet chats, data from virtual private networks, and calls made using Voice over IP software like Skype over to the NSA. In return these partners receive access to the NSA's sophisticated surveillance equipment so that they too can spy on the mass of data that flows in and out of their territory.

=== Review of intelligence agencies ===
;Germany
In July 2013, the German government announced an extensive review of Germany's intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany probes secret service ties with US agencies |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8cOrcBcmi1S4CxaYoU8CP75GJpw?docId=CNG.13941495f3f18c4f09f35348610dab3f.921 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305201436/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8cOrcBcmi1S4CxaYoU8CP75GJpw?docId=CNG.13941495f3f18c4f09f35348610dab3f.921 |archivedate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=William Boston |title=Germany to Review Spy Service's Ties With NSA |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324783204578621920253442796 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the U.S. government announced an extensive review of U.S. intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mike Levine |title=White House Picks Panel to Review NSA Programs |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/08/white-house-picks-panel-to-review-nsa-programs/ |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obamafalloutsp"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Luke |title=James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence Who Misled Congress, To Establish Surveillance Review Group |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/13/james-clapper_n_3748431.html |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 13, 2013 |date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;United Kingdom
In October 2013, the British government announced an extensive review of British intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nick Hopkins |author2=Patrick Wintour |author3=Rowena Mason |author4=Matthew Taylor |title=Extent of spy agencies' surveillance to be investigated by parliamentary body |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/17/uk-gchq-nsa-surveillance-inquiry-snowden |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
In December 2013, the Canadian government announced an extensive review of Canada's intelligence services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart Bell |title=Review underway into allegations that national intelligence agency illegally spied on Canadians |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/09/review-underway-into-allegations-that-national-intelligence-agency-illegally-spied-on-canadians/ |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and Alternative Views===
In January 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said that "the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light"&lt;ref name="npr.org" /&gt; and critics such as [[Sean Wilentz]] claimed that "the NSA has acted far more responsibly than the claims made by the leakers and publicized by the press."  In Wilentz' view "The leakers have gone far beyond justifiably blowing the whistle on abusive programs. In addition to their alarmism about [U.S.] domestic surveillance, many of the Snowden documents released thus far have had nothing whatsoever to do with domestic surveillance."&lt;ref name="newrepublic.com" /&gt; [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]], former Moscow bureau chief for ''[[The Economist]]'', agreed, asserting that "Snowden's revelations neatly and suspiciously fits the interests of one country: Russia" and citing [[Masha Gessen]]'s statement that "The Russian propaganda machine has not gotten this much mileage out of a US citizen since [[Angela Davis]]'s murder trial in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] (January 23, 2014), [https://www.amazon.com/The-Snowden-Operation-Greatest-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B00I0W61OY The Snowden Operation: Inside the West's Greatest Intelligence Disaster] ASIN:B00I0W61OY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bob Cesca]] objected to ''[[The New York Times]]'' failing to redact the name of an NSA employee and the specific location where an [[al Qaeda]] group was being targeted in a series of slides the paper made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Cesca]] (January 27, 2014), [http://thedailybanter.com/2014/01/the-name-of-an-nsa-agent-exposed-in-poorly-redacted-snowden-document/ NSA Agent’s Identity Exposed in {{Sic|hide=y|Poorly|-}}Redacted Snowden Document] ''The Daily Banter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]] argued that Snowden's revelations had had negative consequences for internet freedom in Russia, as Russian authorities increased their own surveillance and regulation on the pretext of protecting the privacy of Russian users.   Snowden's name was invoked by Russian legislators who supported measures forcing platforms such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Gmail]] and [[YouTube]] to locate their servers on Russian soil or install [[SORM]] black boxes on their servers so that Russian authorities could control them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Soldatov |first1=Andrei |last2=Borogan |first2=Irina |title=The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-61039-573-1 |chapter=The Snowden Affair |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=onIuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195 |pages=195&amp;ndash;222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soldatov also contended that as a result of the disclosures, international support for having national governments take over the powers of the organizations involved in coordinating the Internet's global architectures had grown, which could lead to a Balkanization of the Internet that restricted free access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Soldatov]] (January 8, 2014), [http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=24044 ИТОГИ ГОДА. СПЕЦСЛУЖБЫ] ''ежедневный журнал'' (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation]] issued in October 2013, by [[ICANN]] and other organizations warned against "Internet fragmentation at a national level" and expressed "strong concern over the undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due to recent revelations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation] ''[[ICANN]]'' October 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, [[Freedom House]] said "[s]ome states are using the revelations of widespread surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as an excuse to augment their own monitoring capabilities, frequently with little or no oversight, and often aimed at the political opposition and human rights activists."&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2014/tightening-net-governments Tightening the Net: Governments Expand Online Controls] ''[[Freedom House]]'' Freedom on the Net 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global surveillance whistleblowers''' are [[whistleblowers]] who provided public knowledge of [[global surveillance]].

==Perry Fellwock==
[[Perry Fellwock]] revealed the existence of then ultra secretive [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its global mass surveillance apparatus and activities, including domestic spying, in a 1971 ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' exposé. This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate [[Church Committee]] to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Adrian Chen|Chen, Adrian]] |title=After 30 Years of Silence, the Original NSA Whistleblower Looks Back |url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RZZIrx96?url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |archivedate=2014-08-04 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russ Tice==
In December 2005 [[Russ Tice]] helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005.&lt;ref name=abc2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Brian|title=NSA Whistleblower Alleges Illegal Spying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1491889|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=10 January 2006|quote=The same day ''The New York Times'' broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without warrants, Tice surfaced as a whistleblower in the agency.

==Mark Klein==
[[Mark Klein]] is a former [[AT&amp;T]] technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, [[Data Capture|capture]], and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006.

In recognition of his actions, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = AT&amp;T Whistle-Blower Among Award Winners |first = Anick |last = Jesdanun |date = Feb 27, 2008 |work = |accessdate =Nov 27, 2011 |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/02/27/1329579-att-whistle-blower-among-award-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&amp;T. Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Mark Klein, unredacted (June 8, 2006)|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/SER_klein_decl.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, and was the subject of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues [[J. Kirk Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]], in cooperation with [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] staffer [[Diane Roark]].

==Thomas Tamm==
[[Thomas Tamm]] is a former attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless NSA surveillance]] that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to ''The New York Times'', making the initial disclosure regarding the issue.

==Thomas Drake==
[[Thomas Andrews Drake]] is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[United States Navy]] (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake "mishandled" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the [[Trailblazer Project]].&lt;ref name=shane3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/us/16indict.html |title=Former N.S.A.

==Edward Snowden==
[[Edward Snowden]] is an American computer specialist, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee, who, while working as a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] contractor, disclosed [[Classified information|top secret]] NSA documents to various media outlets, initiating the [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|NSA leaks]], which reveal operational details of a [[global surveillance]] apparatus run by the NSA and other members of the [[Five Eyes]] alliance, along with numerous commercial and international partners.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Whistleblower Edward Snowden on Global Spying|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=December 18, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of classified material was called the most significant leak in US history by [[Pentagon Papers]] leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. A [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|series of exposés]] beginning June 5, 2013 revealed Internet surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]], as well as the interception of US and European telephone [[metadata]], among other disclosures.

[[Globalization]], the flow of information, goods, capital, and people across political and geographic boundaries, allows infectious diseases to rapidly spread around the world, while also allowing the alleviation of factors such as hunger and poverty, which are key determinants of global health.&lt;ref name= global&gt;{{cite web |author=Daulaire, N. |title=Globalization and Health |date=July 12, 1999 |work=International RoundtabResponses to Globalization: Rethinking Equity and Health’ jointly organized by the Society for International Development (SID), the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) |url=http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194117/http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archivedate=2011-06-22}} &lt;!-- same as doi:10.1057/palgrave.development.1110077 ? --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of diseases across wide geographic scales has increased through history.  Early diseases that spread from Asia to Europe were bubonic plague, influenza of various types, and similar infectious diseases.

In the current era of globalization, the world is more interdependent than at any other time.  Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade in agricultural products has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped [[species]] barriers (see [[zoonosis]]).&lt;ref name= Well &gt;http://www.richardwellsresearch.com/richardwells/pdfs%20and%20documents/BJIC%20Oct&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization intensified during the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]], but trading routes had long been established between Asia and Europe, along which diseases were also transmitted.  An increase in travel has helped spread diseases to natives of lands who had not previously been exposed.  When a [[Indigenous peoples|native]] population is infected with a new disease, where they have not developed [[antibodies]] through generations of previous exposure, the new disease tends to run rampant within the population.

[[Etiology]], the modern branch of [[science]] that deals with the causes of [[infectious disease]], recognizes five major modes of disease transmission: airborne, waterborne, bloodborne, by direct contact, and through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] ([[insect]]s or other creatures that carry germs from one species to another).&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda Jacobs |last=Altman |title=Plague and Pestilence: A History of Infectious Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8dzZAFnHmQC |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow |isbn=978-0-89490-957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans began traveling over seas and across lands which were previously isolated, research suggests that diseases have been spread by all five transmission modes.

==Travel patterns and globalization==
The [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] generally refers to the period between the 15th and 17th centuries.  During this time, technological advances in [[shipbuilding]] and navigation made it easier for nations to explore outside previous boundaries.  Globalization has had many benefits, for example, new products to [[European ethnic groups|European]]s were discovered, such as [[tea]], [[silk]] and [[sugar]] when Europeans developed new [[trade routes]] around [[Africa]] to [[India]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], [[Asia]], and eventually running to the [[Americas]].

In addition to trading in goods, many nations began to trade in [[slavery]].  Trading in slaves was another way by which diseases were carried to new locations and peoples, for instance, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas.  During this time, different [[societies]] began to integrate, increasing the concentration of [[human]]s and [[animal]]s in certain places, which led to the emergence of new diseases as some jumped in mutation from animals to humans.

During this time [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s' and [[witch doctor]]s' treatment of disease was often focused on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[religion]], and healing the entire [[Human body|body]] and [[soul]], rather than focusing on a few symptoms like [[modern medicine]].  Early medicine often included the use of [[herbs]] and [[meditation]].  Based on archeological evidence, some prehistoric practitioners in both Europe and South America used [[trephining]], making a hole in the skull to release illness.&lt;ref&gt;"One curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to five centimeters across, in the skull of the victim—the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient's survival. The practice still exists among primitive people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct. "Medicine, History of",  (2006), in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved November 22, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-35642&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe diseases were often thought of as [[supernatural]] or magical.  The result of the introduction of Eurasian diseases to the Americas was that many more native peoples were killed by disease and [[Microorganism|germs]] than by the colonists' use of guns or other weapons.  Scholars estimate that over a period of four centuries, epidemic diseases wiped out as much as 90 percent of the American indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

In Europe during the age of exploration, diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]] and [[tuberculosis]] (TB) had already been introduced centuries before through trade with Asia and Africa.  People had developed some antibodies to these and other diseases from the Eurasian continent.  When the Europeans traveled to new lands, they carried these diseases with them.  (Note: Scholars believe TB was already endemic in the Americas.)  When such diseases were introduced for the first time to new populations of humans, the effects on the native populations were widespread and deadly. The [[Columbian Exchange]], referring to [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first contact with the native peoples of the [[Caribbean]], began the trade of animals, and plants, and unwittingly began an exchange of diseases.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

It was not until the 1800s that humans began to recognize the existence and role of germs and [[microbes]] in relation to disease.  Although many thinkers had ideas about germs, it was not until [[Louis Pasteur]] spread his [[germ theory|theory about germs]], and the need for washing hands and maintaining [[sanitation]] (particularly in medical practice), that anyone listened.  Many people were quite skeptical, but on May 22, 1881 Pasteur persuasively demonstrated the validity of his germ theory of disease with an early example of [[vaccination]]. The [[anthrax]] vaccine was administered to 25 [[sheep]] while another 25 were used as a control. On May 31, 1881 all of the sheep were exposed to anthrax.  While every sheep in the [[control group]] died, each of the vaccinated sheep survived.&lt;ref name= CDCPT&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trachtman P |title=About the Cover: Experimentation du virus charbonneux: "Le Pelerin," 1922.

Dis. |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=February 2002 |doi=10.3201/eid0802.AC0802 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/2/ac-0802_article.htm?s_cid=eid_cover_img |pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur’s experiment would become a milestone in disease prevention.  His findings, in conjunction with other vaccines that followed, changed the way globalization affected the world.

===Effects of globalization on disease in the modern world===
Modern modes of [[transportation]] allow more people and products to [[travel]] around the world at a faster pace; they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors.&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309100984/html/22.html |title=''The Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control: Exploring the Consequences and Opportunities,'' Workshop Summary - Forum on Microbial Threats |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[West Nile Virus]].  It is believed that this disease reached the [[United States]] via “mosquitoes that crossed the ocean by riding in airplane wheel wells and arrived in New York City in 1999.”&lt;ref name=NAP /&gt; With the use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until after they get home, and having exposed others to the disease along the way.

As medicine has progressed, many vaccines and cures have been developed for some of the worst diseases (plague, syphilis, typhus, cholera, malaria) which people suffer.  But, because the [[evolution]] of disease [[organisms]] is very rapid, even with vaccines, there is difficulty providing full [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to many diseases.  Finding vaccines at all for some diseases remains extremely difficult.  Without vaccines, the global world remains vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Evolution of disease presents a major threat in modern times.  For example, the current "swine flu" or [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 virus]] is a new strain of an old form of flu, known for centuries as Asian flu based on its origin on that continent.  From 1918–1920, a post-[[World War I]] [[1918 flu pandemic|global influenza epidemic]] killed an estimated 50–100 million people, including half a million in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/reviews/reviewview.cfm?id=72 Dorothy A. Pettit and Janice Bailie, ''Before There Was Swine Flu''; Anne Sealey, Review: "A Cruel Wind: Pandemic Flu in America, 1918-1920"], eHistory, July Review, 2009; Ohio State University, accessed 26 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  H1N1 is a virus that has evolved from and partially combined with portions of avian, swine, and human flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Debora |title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2706 |date=29 April 2009 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization has increased the spread of infectious diseases from South to North, but also the risk of non-communicable diseases by transmission of culture and behavior from North to South. It is important to target and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in developing countries.  However, addressing the risk factors of non-comunicable diseases and lifestyle risks in the South that cause disease, such as use or consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods, is important as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ollila, Eeva |title=Global Health Priorities-Priorities of the Wealthy? |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-1-6 |pmid=15847685 |pmc=1143784 |url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/1/1/6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific diseases==

===Plague===
[[Bubonic plague]] is a variant of the deadly [[flea]]-borne disease [[Yersinia pestis|plague]], which is caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', that devastated human populations beginning in the 14th century.  Bubonic plague is primarily spread by fleas that lived on the [[black rat]], an animal that originated in south Asia and spread to Europe by the 6th century.  It became common to cities and villages, traveling by ship with explorers.  A human would become infected after being bitten by an infected flea.  The first sign of an infection of bubonic plague is swelling of the [[lymph nodes]], and the formation of [[buboes]].  These buboes would first appear in the groin or armpit area, and would often ooze [[pus]] or [[blood]].  Eventually infected individuals would become covered with dark splotches caused by bleeding under the skin.  The symptoms would be accompanied by a high [[fever]], and within four to seven days of infection, more than half the victims would die.&lt;ref name= Mariner&gt;http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?page=faq. Retrieved October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th and 15th century, humans did not know that a bacterium was the cause of plague, and efforts to slow the spread of disease were futile.

The first recorded outbreak of plague occurred in [[China]] in the 1330s, a time when China was engaged in substantial trade with western Asia and Europe.  The plague reached Europe in October 1347.  It was thought to have been brought into Europe through the port of [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], by a fleet of Genoese trading ships from [[Caffa|Kaffa]], a seaport on the [[Crimean peninsula]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;  When the ship left port in Kaffa, many of the inhabitants of the town were dying, and the crew was in a hurry to leave.  By the time the fleet reached Messina, all the crew were either dead or dying; the rats that took passage with the ship slipped unnoticed to shore and carried the disease with them and their fleas.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Within Europe, the plague struck port cities first, then followed people along both sea and land trade routes.  It raged through [[Italy]] into [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].  It was carried over the [[Alps]] into [[Switzerland]], and eastward into [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt; For a time during the 14th and 15th centuries, the plague would recede.  Every ten to twenty years, it would return.  Later [[epidemics]], however, were never as widespread as the earlier outbreaks, when 60% of the population died.

The plague has never died out.  From 1896–1918 the plague swept through India, taking the lives of over 12.5 million people.  Between 1906 and 1914, the Plague Research Commission was created, and published supplements to the ''Journal of Hygiene''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Catanach, I.J. |title=The "Globalization" of Disease? India and the Plague |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=131–153, See p. 131 |date=Spring 2001 |jstor=20078880 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2001.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles===
[[Measles]] is a highly contagious airborne [[virus]] spread by contact with infected oral and nasal fluids.  When a person with measles coughs or sneezes, he releases microscopic particles into the air.  During the 4- to 12-day [[incubation period]], an infected individual shows no symptoms, but as the disease progresses, the following symptoms appear: runny nose, cough, red eyes, extremely high fever and a rash.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance.  In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating.  In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later measles was responsible for the deaths of half the indigenous population of [[Honduras]], and ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious.  According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15, acquiring immunity to further outbreaks.  Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles&gt;{{cite book |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |chapter=Ch. 12: Measles |chapterurl=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html |veditors=Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J |title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |publisher=Public Health Foundation |location=Washington DC |year=2012 |edition=12th |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310044843/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |archivedate=2017-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccination reduced the number of reported occurrences by 98%.  Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite [[Hispanic]] and [[African American]] children under 5 years old.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles /&gt; In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States.  The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.

===Typhus===
Typhus is caused by ''[[rickettsia]]'', which is transmitted to humans through [[lice]].  The main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for [[typhus]] is the [[Oriental rat flea|rat flea]].  Flea bites and infected flea feaces in the respiratory tract are the two most common methods of transmission.  In areas where rats are not common, typhus may also be transmitted through [[cat]] and [[opossum]] fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parola P, Vogelaers D, Roure C, Janbon F, Raoult D |title=Murine typhus in travelers returning from Indonesia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=677–80 |year=1998 |pmid=9866749 |pmc=2640266 |doi=10.3201/eid0404.980423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incubation period]] of typhus is 7–14 days.  The symptoms start with a [[fever]], then headache, [[rash]], and eventually [[stupor]].  Spontaneous recovery occurs in 80–90% of victims.

The first outbreak of typhus was recorded in 1489.  Historians believe that troops from the [[Balkans]], hired by the Spanish army, brought it to Spain with them.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; By 1490 typhus traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] into [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], and by 1494, it had swept across Europe.  From 1500–1914, more soldiers were killed by typhus than from all the combined [[military]] actions during that time.  It was a disease associated with the crowded conditions of urban poverty and [[refugees]] as well.  Finally, during [[World War I]], governments instituted preventative [[delousing]] measures among the armed forces and other groups, and the disease began to decline.&lt;ref name="USAMRMC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[antibiotic]]s has allowed disease to be controlled within two days of taking a 200&amp;nbsp;mg dose of [[tetracycline]].

===Syphilis===
Syphilis is a [[sexually transmitted disease]] that causes open sores, [[delirium]] and rotting skin, and is characterized by [[genital ulcer]]s.  Syphilis can also do damage to the nervous system, brain and heart.  The disease can be transmitted from mother to child.

The origins of [[syphilis]] are unknown, and some historians argue that it descended from a twenty-thousand-year-old African [[zoonosis]].  Other historians place its emergence in the [[New World]], arguing that the crews of Columbus’s ships first brought the disease to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; The first recorded case of syphilis occurred in [[Naples]] in 1495, after [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]] of France besieged the city of Naples, [[Italy]].  The soldiers, and the prostitutes who followed their camps, came from all corners of Europe.  When they went home, they took the disease with them and spread it across the continent.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
[[Smallpox]] is a highly contagious disease caused by the [[Variola virus]].  There are four variations of smallpox; variola major, variola minor, haemorrhagic, and malignant, with the most common being variola major and variola minor.  Symptoms of the disease including [[hemorrhaging]], [[blindness]], back ache, [[vomiting]], which generally occur shortly after the 12- to 17-day incubation period.  The virus begins to attack [[skin]] cells, and eventually leads to an eruption of pimples that cover the whole body.  As the disease progresses, the [[pimples]] fill up with pus or merge.  This merging results in a sheet that can detach the bottom layer from the top layer of skin.  The disease is easily transmitted through airborne pathways (coughing, sneezing, and breathing), as well as through contaminated bedding, clothing or other fabrics,

It is believed that smallpox first emerged over 3000 years ago, probably in [[India]] or [[Egypt]].  There have been numerous recorded devastating [[epidemic]]s throughout the world, with high losses of life.

Smallpox was a common disease in Eurasia in the 15th century, and was spread by [[Exploration|explorers]] and invaders.  After Columbus landed on the island of [[Hispaniola]] during his second voyage in 1493, local people started to die of a [[virulent]] [[infection]].  Before the smallpox epidemic started, more than one million indigenous people had lived on the [[island]]; afterward, only ten thousand had survived.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

During the 16th century, Spanish soldiers introduced smallpox by contact with natives of the [[Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlan]].  A devastating epidemic broke out among the indigenous people, killing thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=200 |title=The Mariners' Museum &amp;#124; EXPLORATION through the AGES |publisher=Mariner.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, smallpox reached [[Massachusetts]], probably brought by earlier explorers to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].”&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;  By 1638 the disease had broken out among people in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  In 1721 people fled the city after an outbreak, but the residents  spread the disease to others throughout the [[thirteen colonies]].  Smallpox broke out in six separate epidemics in the United States through 1968.

The [[smallpox vaccine]] was developed in 1798 by [[Edward Jenner]]. By 1979 the disease had been completely [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicated]], with no new outbreaks.  The [[WHO]] stopped providing vaccinations and by 1986, vaccination was no longer necessary to anyone in the world except in the event of future outbreak.

=== Leprosy ===
[[Leprosy]], also known as Hansen’s Disease, is caused by a [[bacillus]], ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''.  It is a [[chronic disease]] with an incubation period of up to five years.  Symptoms often include irritation or erosion of the skin, and effects on the [[peripheral nerves]], mucosa of the [[upper respiratory tract]] and eyes.  The most common sign of leprosy are pale reddish spots on the skin that lack sensation.

Leprosy probably originated in [[India]], more than four thousand years ago.  It was prevalent in ancient societies in [[China]], Egypt and India, and was transmitted throughout the world by various traveling groups, including [[Roman Legion]]naires, [[Crusaders]], Spanish [[conquistador]]s, Asian [[seafarer]]s, European colonists, and Arab, African, and American slave traders.  Some historians believe that [[Alexander the Great]]'s troops brought leprosy from India to Europe during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leprosy - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwq4ZAH0?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the crusaders and other travelers, leprosy reached [[epidemic]] proportions by the 13th century.

Once detected, leprosy can be cured using multi-drug therapy, composed of two or three antibiotics, depending on the type of leprosy. In 1991 the World Health Assembly began an attempt to eliminate leprosy.  By 2005 116 of 122 countries were reported to be free of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_20070129/en/ | title=Western Pacific Regional Leprosy Situation in 2005  Fact sheet 28, January 2007 | publisher=WPRO | year=2007 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov. 6, 1880 [[Alphonse Laveran]] discovered that [[malaria]] (then called "Marsh Fever") was a [[protozoa]]n parasite, and that mosquitoes carry and transmit malaria.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Parasitic Diseases. "Lavaran and the Discovery of the Malaria Parasite" [article online] 2004. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/laveran.htm. Accessed on Nov. 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria is a [[protozoan]] [[infectious disease]] that is generally transmitted to [[humans]] by mosquitoes between dusk and dawn. The European variety, known as "vivax" after the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' parasite, causes a relatively mild, yet chronically aggravating disease.  The west African variety is caused by the [[sporozoan]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', and results in a severely debilitating and deadly disease.

Malaria was common in parts of the world where it has now disappeared, as the vast majority of Europe (disease of African descent are particularly diffused in the Empire romain) and North America . In some parts of England, [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to malaria was comparable to that of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] today. Although [[William Shakespeare]] was born at the beginning of a colder period called the "[[Little Ice Age]]", he knew enough ravages of this disease to include in eight parts. Plasmodium vivax lasted until 1958 in the [[polder]]s of Belgium and the Netherlands.
In the 1500s, it was the European settlers and their slaves who probably brought malaria on the American continent (we know that Columbus was suffering from this disease before his arrival in the new land). The Spanish [[Jesuit missionaries]] saw the Indians bordering on Lake Loxa Peru used the [[Cinchona bark]] powder to treat fevers. However, there is no reference to malaria in the medical literature of the Maya or [[Aztecs]]. The use of the bark of the "fever tree" was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries whose Barbabe Cobo who experimented in 1632 and also exports, so that the precious powder s' also called "Jesuit powder" . A study in 2012 of thousands of genetic markers for Plasmodium falciparum samples confirmed the African origin of the parasite in South America (Europeans themselves have been affected by this disease through Africa): it borrowed from the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-nineteenth the two main roads of the slave trade, the first leading to the north of South America (Colombia) by the Spanish, the second most leading south (Brazil) by Portugueses.

Parts of the [[Third World]] are more affected by malaria than the rest of the world. For instance, many inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa are affected by recurring attacks of malaria throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert D. |chapter=The Coming Anarchy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;pg=PA40 |editor=O’Meara, P. |editor2=Mehlinger, H.D. |editor3=Krain, M. |title=Globalization and the Challenges of a New Century: A Reader |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21355-6 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of Africa, there is limited [[running water]].  The residents' use of wells and [[cistern]]s provides many sites for the breeding of mosquitoes and spread of the disease.  Mosquitoes use areas of [[standing water]] like [[marshes]], [[wetlands]], and water drums to breed.

===Tuberculosis===
The [[bacterium]] that causes [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'',  is generally spread when an infected person [[cough]]s and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the [[lungs]], but can spread to any part of the body.  Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria.  But, TB can remain [[dormancy|dormant]] in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. If and when the disease does become active in the body, it can multiply rapidly, causing the person to develop many symptoms including cough (sometimes with blood), night sweats, fever, chest pains, loss of appetite and loss of weight. This disease can occur in both adults and children and is especially common among those with weak or undeveloped [[immune system]]s.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of history’s greatest killers, taking the lives of over 3 million people annually.  It has been called the "white plague". According to the WHO, approximately fifty percent of people infected with TB today live in [[Asia]].  It is the most prevalent, life-threatening infection among [[AIDS]] patients.  It has increased in areas where HIV [[seroprevalence]] is high.&lt;ref name=TBF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/20120306_tuberculosis/en/index.html | title=Tuberculosis facts. | publisher=WPRO | date=March 2012 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air travel]] and the other methods of travel which have made global interaction easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG vaccine]] was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and [[miliary TB]] in childhood.  But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are [[rifampicin]] and [[isoniazid]].  There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB.  The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria.&lt;ref name=TBF /&gt; Antibiotic-resistant TB is also known as "[[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]]." "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of "second-line" antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" in poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Major Infectious Diseases in the World — To Treat or Not to Treat? | author=Farmer, P. | journal=The New England Journal of Medicine | year=2001 | month=| volume=345 | issue=3|pages=208–210 | doi=10.1056/nejm200107193450310 | pmid=11463018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[HIV and AIDS]] are among the newest and deadliest diseases. According to the [[World Health Organization]], it is unknown where the [[HIV]] [[virus]] originated, but it appeared to move from animals to humans.  It may have been isolated within many groups throughout the world.  It is believed that HIV arose from another, less harmful virus, that mutated and became more virulent.  The first two AIDS/HIV cases were detected in 1981.  As of 2013, an estimated 1.3 million persons in the [[United States]] were living with HIV or AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000903/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost 110,000 in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212121444/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/data/epi_core_dec2014.png?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts in numerous countries, awareness and prevention programs have not been effective enough to reduce the numbers of new HIV cases in many parts of the world, where it is associated with high mobility of men, poverty and sexual mores among certain populations.  Uganda has had an effective program, however. Even in countries where the epidemic has a very high impact, such as Swaziland and South Africa, a large proportion of the population do not believe they are at risk of becoming infected. Even in countries such as the UK, there is no significant decline in certain at-risk communities. 2014 saw the greatest number of new diagnoses in gay men, the equivalent of nine being diagnosed a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nat.org.uk/Media-and-Blog/Press-Releases/2014/November/PHE_Stat_Gay_Men_Stats.aspx#sthash.pgSuiy7L.dpuf | title=Press Releases &amp;#124; National AIDS Trust - NAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, HIV prevention methods focused primarily on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV through behaviour change. The ABC Approach - "Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a Condom". However, by the mid-2000s, it became evident that effective HIV prevention requires more than that and that interventions need to take into account underlying socio-cultural, economic, political, legal and other contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-prevention-programmes.htm#sthash.8IYVPGF1.dpuf | title=HIV prevention programmes overview| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ebola===
{{main|2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak}}
The [[Ebola]] outbreak, which was the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in [[Guinea]] in March 2014. The [[WHO]] warned that the number of [[Ebola]] patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll Ebola cases in west Africa could rise to 20,000 says WHO] Lisa O'Carroll, Society, theguardian, 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak was accelerating. [[Medecins sans Frontieres]] has just opened a new Ebola hospital in [[Monrovia]], and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO /&gt; [[Brice de la Vinge]], MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.

===Leptospirosis===
[[Leptospirosis]], also known as '''field fever''' is an infection caused by ''Leptospira''. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. ''Leptospira'' is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, most commonly by rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slack A | year = 2010 | title = Leptospirosis | url = | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 495–8 | pmid = 20628664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The countries with the highest reported incidence are located in the Asia-Pacific region (Seychelles, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand) with incidence rates over 10 per 1000,000 people s well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pappas G, Papadimitriou P, Siozopoulou V, Christou L, Akritidis N | year = 2008 | title = The globalization of leptospirosis: worldwide incidence trends | url = | journal = Int J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 351–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in global travel and eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leptospirosis, Challenge Eco | year = 2000 | title = participants | url = | journal = Commun Dis Rep CDR Wkly | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis, and travelers from around the world have become exposed to the threat of leptospirosis. Despite decreasing prevalence of leptospirosis in endemic regions, previously non-endemic countries are now reporting increasing numbers of cases due to recreational exposure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wasinski B, Dutkiewicz J | year = 2013 | title = Leptospirosis–current risk factors connected with human activity and the environment | url = | journal = Ann Agric Environ Med | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 239–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International travelers engaged in adventure sports are directly exposed to numerous infectious agents in the environment and now comprise a growing proportion of cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bandara Medhani, Ananda Mahesha, Wickramage Kolitha, Berger Elisabeth, Agampodi Suneth | year = 2014 | title = Globalization of leptospirosis through travel and migration | url = | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-communicable disease==

[[Globalization]] can benefit people with [[non-communicable diseases]] such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the [[World Trade Organization]] can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While it has to be admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates how much a government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has to be acknowledged that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beaglehole R, Yach D |title=Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic diseases of adults |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9387 |pages=903–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=13678979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14335-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)14335-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MACMILLAM FORUM 020.JPG|thumb|Overinflating a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]]]]
'''Hot water bottle blowing''' is the deliberate inflation of a [[Hot water bottle|hot-water bottle]] by blowing. Air is breathed into the bottle until it stretches beyond its capacity and consequently explodes. It is a challenging feat of strength which is included in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The challenge is most commonly undertaken by breathing air from the mouth, though it has also been achieved by blowing through the nose. The activity presents a potential hazard for physical injury to eyes and lungs.

==Description==
Blowing up a hot-water bottle is usually performed to impress a crowd. It requires significant [[lung volumes|lung capacity]] as well as chest and abdominal strength. It is regarded as potentially hazardous because of the risk of harm to the eyes and the possibility of the contained air rushing back into the lungs and causing damage or, reportedly, death.&lt;ref name="USAWA" /&gt; Former world record holder Brian Jackson has claimed that he knows of at least five deaths resulting from the practice, although this is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="HuffPost" /&gt; [[Georgians|Georgian]] athlete Jemal Tkeshelashvili has demonstrated two variations on the traditional method: blowing the bottle up with his nose, and blowing one up while somebody sits on top of it.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In Britain, the hot-water bottles used conform to standard [[British Standards|BS]] 1970:2006.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2018}}

==Records==
There are three hot-water bottle blowing records officiated by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The "Fastest hot water bottle burst" by a male is held by Shaun Jones from the United Kingdom. He achieved a time of 6.52 seconds on the set of Italian show ''Lo Show Dei Record'' on 31 March 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness1" /&gt; Jones also holds the record for the "Fastest time to burst three hot water bottles" setting the time of 28.82 seconds on 17 November 2011.&lt;ref name="Guinness3" /&gt; Jemal Tkeshelashvili holds the record for "Most hot water bottles burst with the nose in one minute". Tkeshelashvili successfully exploded three hot-water bottles during a live television broadcast of ''Das Sommerfest der Abenteuer'' in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, on 2 June 2012.&lt;ref name="GuinnessN" /&gt; Shaun Jones is also included in the Record Holders Republic registry as holding numerous variations of blowing up hot-water bottles, including doing so while standing on his head and while cycling at a minimum speed of {{convert|20|mph}} on a stationary bicycle.&lt;ref name="RHR" /&gt;

The law creates a new [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=BF72E2C1162C7C49D52DE78D65BEF5B4.tpdila07v_2?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000030934655&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000025503132&amp;dateTexte=20160309 chapter] in the Code of Internal Security aimed at regulating the surveillance programs of French [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], in particular those of the [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] (domestic intelligence) and the [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] (foreign intelligence).

==History==
The Intelligence Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 19 March 2015 by French Prime Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and presented as the government's reaction to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/infosociety/outcry-over-french-intelligence-bill-313779 | title=Outcry over French Intelligence Bill | publisher=EurActiv | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=3 May 2015 | author=Robert, Aline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite widespread mobilization, the Bill was adopted with 438 votes in favor, 86 against and 42 abstentions
at the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150506163503/http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/scrutins/detail/%28legislature%29/14/%28num%29/1109&lt;/ref&gt; and 252 for, 67 against and 26 abstentions at the [[Senate (France)|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20150610142506/http://www.senat.fr/scrutin-public/2014/scr2014-200.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into law on 24 July 2015.

Although framed by the government as a response to the Paris attacks of January 2015, the passage of the Intelligence Act was actually long in the making. The previous law providing a framework for the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies was the [[Wiretapping Act of-1991 (France)|Wiretapping Act of 1991]], aimed at regulating telephone wiretaps. Many surveillance programs developed in the 2000s—especially to monitor Internet communications—were rolled out outside of any legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;Tréguer, Félix. "From Deep State Illegality to Law of the Land: The Case of Internet Surveillance in France," April 2016. https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01306332/document.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2008, the French government's White Paper of Defense and National Security stressed that "intelligence activities do not have the benefit of a clear and sufficient legal framework", and said that "legislative adjustments" were necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title=Livre blanc sur la Défense et la Sécurité nationale | author=French government | date=June 2008 | page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
This section summarizes the main provisions of the Intelligence Act.&lt;ref&gt;A rough translation of the Act is available at: https://wiki.laquadrature.net/French_Intelligence_Laws&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===
Through article L. 811-3, the Act extended the number of objectives that can justify extrajudicial surveillance. These include:
* national independence, territorial integrity and national defense;
* major interests in foreign policy, implementation of European and international obligations of France and prevention of all forms of foreign interference;
* major economic, industrial and scientific interests of France;
* prevention of terrorism;
* prevention of: a) attacks on the republican nature of institutions; b) actions towards continuation or reconstitution of groups disbanded (article L. 212-1 of criminal code); c) collective violence likely to cause serious harm to public peace;
* prevention of organized crime and delinquency;
* prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

These surveillance powers can also be used by law enforcement agencies that are not part of the official "intelligence community" and whose combined staff is well over 45,000.

===Oversight===
The existing oversight commission, the ''Commission nationale de contrôle des interceptions de sécurité'', was replaced by a new oversight body called the "National Oversight Commission for Intelligence-Gathering Techniques" (''Commission nationale de contrôle des techniques de renseignement'', or CNCTR). It is composed of:

* four members of Parliament designated by the Presidents of both chambers of Parliament;
* two administrative judges and two judicial judges designated respectively by the Council of State and the ''Cour de Cassation'';
* one technical expert designated by the telecom National Regulatory Authority (the addition of a commissioner with technical expertise was the main innovation).

The CNCTR has 24 hours to issue its ''ex ante'' non-binding opinion regarding the surveillance authorizations delivered by the Prime Minister before surveillance begins, except in cases of "absolute emergency" where it is simply notified of the surveillance measure within 24 hours upon deliverance (article L. 821-3).

For ''ex post'' oversight, the CNCTR has "permanent, comprehensive and direct access to records, logs, collected intelligence, transcripts and extractions" of collected data. It is able to conduct both planned and in the premises where these documents are centralized (article L. 833-2-2). If an irregularity is found, it can send to the Prime Minister a "recommendation" so that she can put an end to it. One hugely significant exception to the CNCTR's oversight powers are the bulk of data obtained through data-sharing with foreign intelligence agencies (article L. 833-2-3).

===Wiretaps and access to metadata===
Techniques of communications surveillance covered by the Act include telephone or Internet [[wiretaps]] (L. 852-1), access to identifying data and other [[metadata]] (L. 851-1), [[geotagging]] (L. 851-4) and computer network exploitation (L. 853-2), all of which are subject to authorization of a renewable duration of 4 months.

===Black boxes and real-time access to metadata===
The Act authorizes the use of scanning device (nicknamed "black boxes") to be installed on the infracturstures of telecom operators and hosting providers. Article L. 851-3 of the Code of Internal Security provides that, "for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, automated processing techniques may be imposed on the networks of [telecom operators and hosting providers] in order to detect, according to selectors specified in the authorisation, communications that are likely to reveal a terrorist threat.

Another provision limited to anti-terrorism allows for the real-time collection of metadata (article L. 851-3, for terrorism only and for a 4 months period). Initially, the provision targeted only individuals "identified as a [terrorist] threat". After the [[2016 Nice Attack]], it was extended by a Bill of the state of emergency to cover individuals "likely to be related to a threat" or who simply belong to "the entourage" of individuals "likely related to a threat". According to [[La Quadrature du Net]], this means that the provision can now potentially cover "hundreds or even thousands of persons (...) rather than just the 11 700 individuals" reported to be on the French terrorism [[wikt:watchlist|watchlist]].&lt;ref&gt;La Quadrature du Net, "French State of Emergency: Overbidding Mass Surveillance", 21 July 2016. Available at: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/french-state-of-emergency-overbidding-mass-surveillance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer Network Exploitation===
The Act authorizes [[computer network exploitation]], or computer hacking, as a method for intelligence gathering. Article L. 853-2 allows for:
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data stored in a computer system;
* access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data, as it is displayed on a user's computer screen, as it is entered by keystrokes, or as received and transmitted by audiovisual peripheral devices.

Considering the intrusiveness of computer hacking, the law provides that these techniques are authorized for a duration of 30 days, and only "when intelligence cannot be collected by any other legally authorized mean."

The Act also grants blanket immunity to intelligence officers who carry on computer crimes into computer systems located abroad (article 323-8 of the Criminal Code).

===International surveillance===
The Act also provides chapter on the "surveillance of international communications", particularly relevant for the DGSE's surveillance programs. International communications are defined as "communications emitted from or received abroad" (article L. 854-1 and following). They can be intercepted and exploited in bulk on the French territory with reduced oversight. Safeguards in terms of bulk exploitation and [[data retention]] are lessened for foreigners (though the definition of foreigners is technical, i.e. people using non-French "technical identifiers").

===Data retention periods===
For national surveillance measures, once communications data are collected by intelligence agencies, retention periods are the following:
* Content (''correspondances''): 1 month after collection (for encrypted content, period starts after decryption, within the limit of 6 years after initial collection);
* Metadata: 4 years (compared to a 3-year period before the adoption of the Act).

For international surveillance, retention periods depend on whether one end of the communication uses a "technical identifiers traceable to the national territory" or not, in which case the "national" retention periods are applicable, but they start after the first exploitation and no later than six months after collection (article L. 854-8). If both ends of the communication are foreign, the following periods apply:
* Content: 1 year after first exploitation, within the limit of 4 years after collection (for encrypted content, periods starts after decryption, within the limit of 8 years after collection);
* Metadata: 6 years

The law fails to provide any framework to limit staff access to collected intelligence once it is stored by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

===Redress mechanism===
The Act reorganizes redress procedures against secret surveillance, establishing the possibility to introduce a legal challenge before the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Council of State]] after having unsuccessfully thought redress before the CNCTR.

==Criticism and legal challenges==
During the Parliamentary debate, the bill faced severe criticism from several organizations including [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés|National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL)]], [[Conseil national du numérique|National Digital Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nextinpact.com/news/93509-projet-loi-sur-renseignement-tous-points-noirs-denonces-par-cnil.htm | title=Bill on Intelligence: all black spots denounced by the CNIL | publisher=Next Impact | date=19 March 2015 | accessdate=4 May 2015 | author=Rees, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mediapart]],&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/la-redaction-de-mediapart/240415/4-mai-mediapart-organise-les-six-heures-contre-la-surveillance&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Quadrature du Net]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laquadrature.net/en/press-release&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea to form an international federation of educational associations for workers was conceived during [[World War II]], at the annual conference of the [[United Kingdom]] Workers' Educational Association. In 1945 a conference for members of workers' educational organisations from a number of countries was held in London, where it was resolved to create an international coalition to support collaboration between organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=UIA Open Yearbook - IFWEA History|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1947 the International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations (IFWEA) was officially launched at a conference in London where a formal constitution was adopted. Worker representatives from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden attended, while observers from Germany, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and the United States of America were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/tom.davies/IFWEA.html|title=Project on the Evolution of International Non-Governmental Organisations - City University, London|last=Davies|first=Dr Thomas Richard|date=10 June 2010|website=staff.city.ac.uk.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A President and Secretary General were elected, and an Executive Committee was appointed with regional representation. Representation is now regularly modified to reflect the  federation's membership.

Over the past 71 years membership of IFWEA has increased. {{As of|2018}}, IFWEA has affiliates in more than 30 countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines, India, Cambodia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Belgium, Bolivia, Peru and the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100053278|title=Members - IFWEA|last=|first=|date=|website=uia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFWEA helps new organisations, particularly in [[developing countries]], and provides a global space for worker educators to share resources and advance the role of trade unions and community struggles in the transformation of society. An important role is to facilitate information exchanges between members.

==Purpose==

The purpose of IFWEA is to “advance the education of the public with respect to the democratic labour movement; and to promote the carrying out of free and voluntary educational work, according to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, justice and equality, and democracy and freedom”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifwea.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=IFWEA - Our Motivation: Purpose and Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=ifwea.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The highest decision making assembly in IFWEA is the quadrennial International General Conference.  The General Secretary, President and Executive Committee are elected at this conference. The 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; IFWEA General Conference was held in Lima, Peru in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smlr.rutgers.edu/news/international-federation-workers-education-association-ifwea-22nd-international-conference|title=International Federation of Workers' Education Association (IFWEA) 22nd International Conference - Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations|last=|first=|date=|website=smlr.rutgers.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the IFWEA Secretariat is to stimulate the development of a democratic workers’ education movement, by providing contact between member organisations, assisting with the development of partnerships, and promoting best practice in educational design and delivery through the provision of education resources, web communication and learning events such as workshops, seminars and conferences. The IFWEA Secretariat was registered in Cape Town, South Africa in 2009, after the election of IFWEA General Secretary Sahra Ryklief in December 2007. Previously it had been registered in the UK with the Secretariat in Manchester, and prior to that, it was hosted by the AOF Norway, with the Secretariat in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/Careers/Winning-Women-Sahra-Ryklief-Creating-the-doers-of-tomorrow-20151108|title=City Press/News24 - Sahra Ryklief interview|last=|first=|date=|work=city-press.news24.com|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival records of IFWEA 1945 to 1986 are held at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Library Collections and University Archives at London Metropolitan University, reference code GB 1924 IFWEA. Current records are held at the Institute of The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.socialhistory.org/Record/ARCH00636|title=Collection Summary: International Federation of Workers' Educational Associations Archives|website=search.socialhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">The '''International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations''' ('''ISCSC''') is an international scholarly organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of [[civilizations]].  Based at [[Western Michigan University]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/11217607.0001.204/--politics-in-a-world-of-civilizations-long-term-perspectives?rgn=main;view=fulltext| title=Politics in a World of Civilizations: Long-term Perspectives on Relations between Peoples|author=Brett Bowden|publisher=''Human Figurations: Long-term Perspectives on the Human Condition'', Volume 1, Issue 2|date=July 2012|accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ISCSC holds an annual conference and publishes the journal ''[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]''.

==Brief history==
In October 1961, in Salzburg, Austria, an extraordinary group of scholars gathered to create the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations. Among the 26 founding members from Austria, Germany, France, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, England, Russia, the United States, China and Japan were such luminaries as Pitirim Sorokin and Arnold Toynbee.  For six days, the participants debated such topics as the definition of “civilization,” problems in the analysis of complex cultures, civilizational encounters in the past, the Orient versus the Occident, problems of universal history, theories of historiography, and the role of the “human sciences” in “globalization.”  The meeting was funded by the Austrian government, in cooperation with UNESCO, and received considerable press coverage.  Sorokin was elected the Society’s first president.  After several meetings in Europe, the advancing age of its founding members and the declining health of then president, Othmar F. Anderle, were important factors in the decision to transfer the Society to the United States.   Between 1968 and 1970 Roger Williams Wescott of Drew University facilitated that transition.  In 1971, the first annual meeting of the ISCSC (US) was held in Philadelphia.  Important participants in that meeting and in the Society’s activities during the next years included Benjamin Nelson (the Society’s first American president), Roger Wescott, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, David Wilkinson, Rushton Coulborn and C.P. Wolf.  In 1974, the Salzburg branch was formally dissolved, and from that year to the present there has been only one International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC). 

	The presidents of the ISCSC are, in order: In Europe, Pitirim Sorokin and Othmar Anderle; in the United States, Benjamin Nelson, Vytautas Kavolis, Matthew Melko, Michael Palencia-Roth, Roger Wescott, Shuntaro Ito (from Japan), Wayne Bledsoe, Lee Daniel Snyder, Andrew Targowski, David Rosner and the current president Toby Huff.  To date, the Society has held 46 meetings, most of them in the United States but also in Salzburg, Austria; Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic; Dublin, Ireland; Chiba, Japan; Frenchman’s Cove, Jamaica; St. Petersburg, Russia; Paris, France; New Brunswick, Canada; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  More than 30 countries are represented in the Society’s membership.  Its intellectual dynamism and vibrancy over the years have been maintained and enhanced through its annual meetings, its publications, and the participation of such scholars as Talcott Parsons, Hayden White, Immanuel Wallerstein, Gordon Hewes, André Gunder Frank, Marshall Sahlins, Lynn White Jr., and Jeremy Sabloff.  The Society is committed to the idea that complex civilizational problems can best be approached through multidisciplinary analyses and debate by scholars from a variety of fields.  The Comparative Civilizations Review, which welcomes submissions from the Society’s members as well as other scholars, has been published continually since its inaugural issue in 1979.

==Activities==
The ISCSC is a multidisciplinary scholarly organization that has connections with comparative studies programs throughout the world. The society holds an annual conference, often with the cooperation of other scholarly organizations based in the conference locale. One example of this is the 1998 conference held at [[Reitaku University]] in Japan together with the Japan Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations; the two organizations continue to have a close relationship.

The ISCSC publishes the bi-annual ''''Comparative Civilizations Review'''', a peer-reviewed journal. The blog Civilitas: https://civilitasblog.blogspot.com/ has been active since 2011.

'''Language &lt;i&gt;localisation&lt;/i&gt;''' (or '''&lt;i&gt;localization&lt;/i&gt;''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#iseize|spelling-differences]]) is the process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region (from [[Latin]] ''locus'' (place) and the English term ''[[locale (computer software)|locale]]'', "a place where something happens or is set").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2005|title=locale|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as [[internationalization and localization|internationalisation and localisation]].


Language localisation differs from [[Translation|translation activity]] because it involves a comprehensive study of the target culture in order to correctly adapt the product to local needs. Localisation can be referred to by the [[numeronym]] '''L10N''' (as in: "L", followed by ten more letters, and then "N").

The localisation process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation and translation of [[software]], [[video games]], and [[website]]s, as well as audio/[[voiceover]], [[video]], or other [[multimedia]] content, and less frequently to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation processes). Localisation can be done for regions or countries where people speak different languages or where the same language is spoken. For instance, different [[German dialects|dialects of German]], with [[Idiom|different idioms]], are spoken in [[Standard German|Germany]], [[Austrian German|Austria]], [[Swiss German|Switzerland]], and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgium]].

== The overall process: internationalisation, globalisation and localisation ==
The former [[Localization Industry Standards Association]] (LISA) said that globalisation "can best be thought of as a cycle rather than a single process".&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |title=What is Globalization? |work=LISA |publisher=Localization Industry Standards Association |accessdate=6 September 2010 |location=Romainmôtier, Switzerland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101205931/http://www.lisa.org/What-Is-Globalization.48.0.html |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''globalise'' is to plan the design and development methods for a product in advance, keeping in mind a multicultural audience, in order to avoid increased costs and quality problems, save time, and smooth the localising effort for each region or country. Localisation is an integral part of the overall process called '''globalisation'''.
[[File:Globalisationchart.jpg|thumb|400px|The globalisation process &lt;br/&gt;(based on a chart from the LISA website.)&lt;ref name="lisa-whatis"/&gt;]]
There are two primary technical processes that comprise globalisation: internationalisation and localisation.

The first phase, '''internationalisation''', encompasses the planning and preparation stages for a product that is built by design to support global markets. This process removes all cultural assumptions, and any country- or language-specific content is stored so that it can be easily adapted. If this content is not separated during this phase, it must be fixed during localisation, adding time and expense to the project. In extreme cases, products that were not internationalised may not be localisable.

The second phase, '''localisation''', refers to the actual adaptation of the product for a specific market. The localisation phase involves, among other things, the four issues LISA describes as ''linguistic'', ''physical'', ''business and cultural'', and ''technical'' issues.

At the end of each phase, testing (including [[quality assurance]]) is performed to ensure that the product works properly and meets the client's quality expectations.

=== Translation versus localisation ===

Though it is sometimes difficult to draw the limits between translation and localisation, in general localisation addresses significant, non-textual components of products or services. In addition to translation (and, therefore, [[grammar]] and [[spelling|spelling issues]] that vary from place to place where the same language is spoken), the localisation process might include adapting graphics; adopting local currencies; using proper format for date and time, addresses, and phone numbers applicable to the location; the choices of colours; cultural references; and many other details, including rethinking the physical structure of a product. All these changes aim to recognise local sensitivities, avoid conflict with local culture, customs, common habits, and enter the local market by merging into its needs and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/the-importance-of-website-localization-in-a-global-marketplace-part-2|title=The Importance Of Website Localization In A Global Marketplace|last=Pagano|first=Annie|date=June 2018|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.|publisher=Interpreters and Translators, Inc.|location=Glastonbury,Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, localisation aims to offer country-specific websites of the same company or different editions of a book depending on where it is published. It must be kept in mind that a political entity such as a country is not the same as a language or culture; even in countries where there exists a substantially identical relationship between a language and a political entity, there are almost certainly multiple cultures and multiple minority languages even if the minority languages are spoken by transient populations. For instance, [[Japan]]'s national language is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and is the primary language for [[Japan#Languages|over 99% of the population]], but the country also recognises [[Languages of Japan|11 languages officially, others are spoken by transient populations, and others are spoken as second or other languages]].

=== Globalisation versus localisation ===

Whereas localisation is the process of adapting one product to a particular locale, globalisation designs the product to minimise the extra work required for each localisation.

Suppose that a company operating exclusively in [[Germany]] chooses to open a major office in [[Russia]] and needs a [[Standard Russian|Russian-language]] website. The company offers the same products and services in both countries with minor differences, but perhaps some elements that appeared in the original website intended for a German audience are offensive or upsetting in Russia (use of flags, colours, nationalistic images, songs, etc.). Thus, that company might lose a potential market because of small details of presentation.

Furthermore, this company might need to adapt the product to its new buyers; video games are the best example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1485|title=Practical skills for video game translators|last=Chandler|first=Heather Maxwell|date=October–November 2008|journal=MultiLingual|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual.com/articleDetail.php?id=1486 |title=Preserving the spell in games localization|journal=MultiLingual|date=October–November 2008|last=Crosignani|first=Simone|last2=Ballista|first2=Andrea|last3=Minazzi|first3=Fabio|publisher=MultiLingual Computing|location=Sandpoint, Idaho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, suppose instead that this company has major offices in a dozen countries and needs a specifically designed website in each of these countries. Before deciding how to localise the website and the products offered in any given country, a professional in the area might advise the company to create an overall strategy: to globalise the way the organisation does business. The company might want to design a framework to codify and support this global strategy. The globalisation strategy and the globalisation framework would provide uniform guidance for the twelve separate localisation efforts.

Globalisation is especially important in mitigating extra work involved in the long-term cycle of localisation. Because localisation is a cycle and not a one-time project, there will always be new texts, updates, and projects to localise. For example, as the original website is updated over time, each of the localised websites already translated will also need to be updated. This cycle of work is continuous as long as the original project continues to evolve. It is therefore important for globalisation processes to be created and streamlined in order to implement ongoing changes. 

[[Translation memory]] (TM) technology that exists in various [[translation software]] platforms can aid in this specific aspect of the globalisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Way to Translate a Website for Accuracy &amp; SEO|url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/best-way-translate-website-accuracy-seo/|website=Pairaphrase|publisher=Pairaphrase Blog|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language tags and codes ==

[[Language codes]] are closely related to the localising process because they indicate the locales involved in the translation and adaptation of the product. They are used in various contexts; for example, they might be informally used in a document published by the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370200.htm|title=7.2.1. Order of language versions and ISO codes (multilingual texts)|work=Interinstitutional style guide|publisher=Europa Publications Office|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they might be introduced in [[HTML element]] under the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; attribute. In the case of the European Union style guide, the language codes are based on the [[ISO 639-1]] alpha-2 code; in HTML, the [[IETF language tag|language tags]] are generally defined within the Internet Engineering Task Force's ''[[Best Current Practice]]'' [https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47 (BCP) 47].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''BCP'' is a persistent name for a series of IETF [[Request for Comments]] (RFCs) whose numbers change as they are updated. As of 2015-05-28, the latest included RFC about the principles of language tags is RFC 5646, ''Tags for the Identification of Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use one type of code or tag versus another depends upon the nature of the project and any requirements set out for the localisation specialist.

Most frequently, there is a primary sub-code that identifies the language (e.g., "en"), and an optional sub-code in capital letters that specifies the national variety (e.g., "GB" or "US" according to [[ISO 3166-2]]). The sub-codes are typically linked with a hyphen, though in some contexts it's necessary to substitute this with an underscore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/localedata/SUPPORTED?rev=1.102&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;cvsroot=glibc|title=libc/localedata/SUPPORTED - view - 1.102|work=sources.redhat.com|publisher=Red Hat|date=18 February 2007|author=drepper|accessdate=6 September 2010}} (List of supported locales in the GNU &lt;tt&gt;libc&lt;/tt&gt; library.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple language tag systems available for language codification. For example, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) specifies both two- and three-letter codes to represent languages in standards [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]], respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13829">'''MAP International''' is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities.  Recognized for their 99% efficiency rating, they respond to the needs of those they serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Their mission is to advance the total health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. They carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
'''MAP International was founded as Medical Assistance Programs International''', an organization that provides medical supplies abroad, encourages community health development, prevents disease, and responds to disasters, was founded in 1954 by J. Raymond Knighton, the first Executive director of the [[Christian Medical and Dental Society|Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS)]]. MAP International is a member of [http://www.integralalliance.org Integral], an international cooperation of 19 Christian aid organizations. MAP International’s first project was to supply Shering Corporation and Eli Lilly’s donation of 11 tons of medicines abroad in developing areas. 

=== Disaster relief ===
Since then, MAP International has instituted numerous projects including but not limited to emergency relief efforts after Typhoon Gloria in Taiwan, civilian casualties in Panama, the fall of the Soviet Union, Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, the fall of the Taliban, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, and Zika relief in Latin America. MAP International also started Fellowship programs to train medical students, opened offices in developing areas such as Ecuador, Kenya, and West Africa, and donated billions of dollars in medicines and supplies to people in need.

=== Mission statement ===
MAP's Mission | MAP International is a global Christian health and relief organization that partners with people living in conditions of poverty to save lives and develop healthier families and communities. Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change. Our mission is to advance the Total Health of people living in the world’s poorest communities. We carry out that mission in the broad programmatic areas of community health development, disease prevention and eradication, relief and rehabilitation and global health advocacy. Although MAP International is a Christian organization, it has a policy against discrimination based on religion, gender, race, and other aspects of an individual’s background, and will not refuse help to anyone based on these classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/about-map-guiding-principles|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credibility ==
MAP International’s status as a highly credible organization is well attested to by multiple well-known sources. [[Forbes|Forbes, Inc.]] recognizes MAP International as the #37 Largest U.S. Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/map-international/|title=MAP International on the Forbes The 100 Largest U.S. Charities List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the MAP International program is very well recognized and generates a large amount of revenue. It illuminates important aspects of the program such as its donor dependency, total revenue, amount spent on charitable work, and fundraising efficiency. [[Better Business Bureau|BBB]] lists MAP International as an accredited charity, meaning it meets the standards in terms of governance, measuring effectiveness, finances, and fund raising and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/map-international-in-brunswick-ga-1681|title=Charity Report - MAP International - give.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charity Navigator]] rates MAP International as 100 out of 100, and four out of four stars, and includes information about the program’s accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4042#.UmNRshbU7lJ|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for MAP International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNBC named MAP International #2 on their list of Top-Ten Charities Changing the World in 2015.  [[POPLINE|Popline]] points out that some health workers have biases against working with faith-based programs, but that the merits of the MAP International program should dispel these biases. It also discusses the financial benefits of FBOs in relation to “their ability to leverage volunteer work with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popline.org/node/241130Green, E. C. (2003, September 24). Faith-based Organization: Contributions to HIV Prevention. Popline.]&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Current projects ==

=== Disaster relief ===
MAP International works to respond to both natural and conflict related emergencies. MAP International provides medical relief shipments to those in need and monitors the health of those in need, if an emergency occurs in a country MAP International has instituted a country presence it implements a country office response in which MAP International staff mobilize to provide health care, and utilizes community based disaster mitigation to train community members to manage the effects of the disaster and promote health in the wake of the disaster on a long-term scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//DISASTER%20RELIEF%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt; Current MAP International disaster relief programs include Typhoon Haiyan: Philippines, Cyclone Phailin, Oklahoma Tornado, and Syrian Refugee relief. MAP International has responded to Typhoon Haiyan by shipping $4.2 million in medicines and supplies, and is still in the process of responding by providing emergency health care kits to victims. MAP International recognizes its partners for their integral role in efficiently distributing donated medicines and supplies, and states the difficulties they have encountered in getting the medicines to the victims. For example, all of the medicine shipments in Leyte Island were washed away when the typhoon hit that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/568/typhoon_haiyan_map_is_responding|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the detrimental effects of Cyclone Phailin, MAP International is providing India with temporary shelter structures, food, medicine, and cooking utensils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/emergency-response/499/cyclone_phailin_hits_india|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP International has responded to the Oklahoma Tornado by donating over $127,000 of supplies to their partner, Convoy of Hope, in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/oklahoma-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation also mentions MAP International's affiliation with Abbott in response to the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bclc.uschamber.com/site-page/oklahoma-tornadoes-corporate-aid-tracker|title=(2013). Oklahoma Tornadoes--Current Aid Tracker. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the civil war in Syria, MAP International has sent two shipments to refugees, and is still responding by preparing a third shipment to send when sufficient funding is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.map.org/content/syria-relief|title=MAP International Home - Health &amp; Hope|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saporta Report outlines MAP International's involvement in Syrian Refugee Crisis relief efforts, and briefly describes the cost of these emergency aid kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/blog/2013/04/map-international-providing-medical-relief-to-syrian-refugees/|title=MAP International providing medical relief to Syrian refugees  - SaportaReport|date=29 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformational missions ===
A program to turn short-term missions into long-term local health programs.&lt;ref name="map.org"&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//TOTAL%20HEALTH%20VILLAGE%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Short-term missions ====

Short-term field study for students integrated into the curriculum of a scholastic establishment for credit within the degree areas of health or international development.

==== MAP fellowship ====
Opportunity for fourth year medical students to work during an 8-week program in a MAP-approved hospital or clinic, usually in Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, or Ghana.

==== Partnership opportunities ====
Volunteers are educated about a MAP Internal program and work with members of an underserved community to explore ways to collaborate with MAP International programs.

==== Disaster relief response ====
Emergency aid teams from the United States respond quickly to help affected communities by implementing disaster management strategies and training community members to sustain these programs on a long-term basis.

=== Global essential medicines and supplies (GEMS) ===
MAP International contributes over $250 million inexpensive bought and donated medicines and supplies to philanthropic relief organizations helping underserved communities each year. The medicines provided are from the Essential Drug List (EDL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.org/gems|title=MAP Medical Mission Packs - Medicines for Medical Mission Trips|first=MAP|last=International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal and child health ===
MAP International has implemented programs in Ecuador, Uganda, Kenya, and Bolivia. These programs focus on a plethora of different topics including perinatal care, training health promoters, preventing sexual abuse, providing rehabilitation for victims of sexual abuse, and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//MATERNAL%20AND%20CHILD%20HEALTH%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neglected tropical diseases ===
MAP International has implemented programs in Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to treat and prevent Guinea worm, Buruli ulcer, Leprosy, Yaws, Lymphatic filariasis, Chagas Disease, Soil-transmitted Helminthes, and Rabies. Programs to eradicate these diseases include vaccinations, education, water and sanitation efforts, awareness building, community mobilization, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//NEGLECTED%20TROPICAL%20DISEASES%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Total health village ===
MAP International has implemented programs in 65 villages throughout Kenya, Uganda, Ecuador, Honduras, Bolivia, Indonesia, Liberia, Cote d’Ivore, and Ghana to encourage and equip underserved communities to come up with their own innovative solutions to the daily challenges they face. This program focuses on local solutions to problems within the cultural context of the community and is designed to give the community command of the improvement plan. Community members take part in many aspects of other current projects listed such as water and sanitation efforts and disease treatment, as well as working to settle conflict, train local health promoters, and facilitate economic security.&lt;ref name="map.org"/&gt;

=== Water and sanitation ===
Water and Sanitation are aspects assimilated into all MAP International programs because of the significant impact they have on preventing disease and promoting other facets of Total Health. Water and Sanitation efforts involve building separate waste and clean drinking structures, providing water filters to communities, and establishing Community Led Total Sanitation programs. MAP International utilizes a [[sweat equity]] design to implement [http://www.sawyer.com Sawyer] water filters in underserved communities and implements a small-scale demonstration with the help of a few members in the community before introducing water sanitation efforts on a large-scale throughout the village. Sawyer attests to the integral role MAP International has played in distributing hundreds water filters to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawyer.com/sawyersaves/kenya.html|title=Kenya - Sawyer International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community Led Total Sanitation programs are designed to educate and empower local community members to make their village a more sanitary and healthy environment through education about the negative health effects of drinking unclean water and the importance of separating human waste structures and drinking water structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.map.org/data//WATER%20AND%20SANITATION%20FINAL.pdf (2013). Global Program Scope. Map International.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrohistory''' seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often "assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew C. Wells, Ph.D., ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110824015142/http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf Parallelism: A Handbook of Social Analysis]''. Archived August 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Oswald Spengler]]'s assertion that the lifespan of [[civilization]]s is limited and ultimately they decay, and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. The [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} as it marked the high water point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

According to economists [[Robert Solow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Robert|last1=Solow|title=Endorsements|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9477.html|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Brian Snowdon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Brian|date=June 2008|title=Towards a Unified Theory of Economic Growth.

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve [[global governance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Constitutionalism and World Order|last=Gill|first=Stephen|last2=Cutler|first2=Claire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-05369-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Constitutionalism: International and Private Rule in The New Global Order|last=McBride|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4426-0365-3|editor-last=McBride|editor-first=Stephen|location=Toronto|pages=21|editor-last2=Teeple|editor-first2=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza. The phases are defined by the spread of the disease; [[virulence]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] are not mentioned in the current WHO definition, although these factors have previously been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,637119,00.html |title=A whole industry is waiting for an epidemic |work=Der Spiegel |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV and AIDS ===
{{Main|AIDS pandemic}}
[[HIV]] originated in Africa, and spread to the United States via Haiti between 1966 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/30/science/sci-aids30 | title=Analysis clarifies route of AIDS |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 30, 2007 |last=Chong |first=Jia-Rui |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AIDS]] is currently a pandemic, with infection rates as high as 25% in southern and eastern Africa. In 2006, the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women in [[South Africa]] was 29.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm |title=The South African Department of Health Study, 2006 |publisher=Avert.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective education about safer sexual practices and [[bloodborne infection]] precautions training have helped to slow down infection rates in several African countries sponsoring national education programs. Infection rates are rising again in Asia and the Americas. The AIDS death toll in [[Africa]] may reach 90–100 million by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/04/aids |title=Aids could kill 90 million Africans, says UN |publisher=Guardian |date= 2005-03-04|accessdate=2010-08-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD. Possibly smallpox brought to the Italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the Near East; it killed a quarter of those infected, and up to five million in all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe].

* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox. [[Smallpox]] also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml |title=Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century.

* The [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]], also known as Russian Flu, was first reported in May 1889 in [[Bukhara]], Uzbekistan. By October, it had reached [[Tomsk]] and the [[Caucasus]]. It rapidly spread west and hit [[North America]] in December 1889, South America in February–April 1890, India in February–March 1890, and Australia in March–April 1890. The [[H3N8]] and [[H2N2]] subtypes of the Influenza A virus have each been identified as possible causes. It had a very high attack and [[mortality rate]], causing around a million fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/index.html CIDRAP] article ''Pandemic Influenza'' Last updated 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME.'' April 29, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812. During the retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of [[typhus]] than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213940/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}.

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Microbes: Disease and Plagues in History and Modern Times''; by [[Arno Karlen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disease had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART "Measles and Small Pox as an Allied Army of the Conquistadors of America"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502200745/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART |date=2009-05-02 }} by Carlos Ruvalcaba, translated by Theresa M.

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012153/http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}. Pasteur.fr&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB].

''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12194776 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article |pmc=2732530 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979. The [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] is sometimes called "biological [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]".&lt;ref name="Alibek"&gt;[[Ken Alibek]] and S. Handelman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

[[Haoqiu zhuan]], a Chinese novel. James St. André, author of "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''", wrote that in China the novel was originally "considered second-rate fiction and stood in danger of being completely forgotten with changes in literary taste in the early twentieth century."&lt;ref name="StAndrep39"&gt;St. André, James.

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postnationalism''' or '''non-nationalism'''{{Sfn|Bennett|1998|p=232}} is the process or trend by which [[nation states]] and national identities lose their importance relative to cross nation and self organized or supranational and global entities. Although postnationalism is not strictly considered the antonym of [[nationalism]], the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic as postnationalism is an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]ic process.

There are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements.

Increasing [[globalization]] of ''economic'' factors, such as the expansion of [[international trade]] with [[raw materials]], manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets, have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, [[socio-political power]] is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as [[multinational corporation]]s, the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and [[NATO]]. In addition, [[Broadcast media|media]] and [[entertainment]] industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. [[human migration|Migration]] of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and [[national identities]] often remains important.&lt;ref&gt;R. Koopmans and P. Statham; "Challenging the liberal nation-state? Postnationalism, multiculturalism, and the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain and Germany"; ''American Journal of Sociology'' 105:652–96 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Hackenberg and R.R. Alvarez; "Close-ups of postnationalism: Reports from the US-Mexico borderlands"; ''Human Organization'' 60:97–104 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Bloemraad; "Who claims dual citizenship? The limits of postnationalism, the possibilities of transnationalism, and the persistence of traditional citizenship"; ''International Migration Review'' 38:389–426 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postnationalism and human rights ==
In the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international [[human rights]] law and [[peremptory norm|norm]]s.  International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their "personhood," not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by [[non-citizens]], but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in [[western world|western]] countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), [[Jus sanguinis|citizenship based on ethnic descent]], which had caused German-born [[Turkish people|Turks]], for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include [[Yasemin Soysal]], [[David Jacobson (scholar)|David Jacobson]], and [[Saskia Sassen]].&lt;ref&gt;Yasemin Soysal, "Limits of Citizenship:Migrants and Postnational Membership in Europe," University of Chicago Press, 1994; and David Jacobson, "Rights Across Borders: Immigration and the Decline of Citizenship", Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the European Union ==
The European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rambour; {{cite web |url=http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306143842/http://erg.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Rambour_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Shaw; "Postnational constitutionalism in the European Union"; ''Journal of European Policy'' 6:579–97 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Wilkinson; {{cite web |url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502120037/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=192 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }} (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
In 2015, Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] while defining [[Canadian values]] declared his country to be the world’s first postnational state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tom Nuttall|title=Politicians must keep better control of migration, and tell the truth|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21699310-politicians-must-keep-better-control-migration-and-tell-truth-welcome-up?fsrc=rss%7Cspr|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Guy Lawson|title=Trudeau’s Canada, Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/magazine/trudeaus-canada-again.html?_r=1|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
Catherine Frost, professor of [[political science]] at [[McMaster University]], argues that while the Internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have "the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations".&lt;ref&gt;C. Frost; "Internet galaxy meets postnational constellation: Prospects for political solidarity after the Internet"; ''Information Society'' 22:45–49 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sports ==
Postnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship ([[UEFA Euro 2008]]) "the first postnational" European Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kuper; "Steeds Liever"; ''Vrij Nederland'' p. 24, June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans [[sportsmanship]] and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.

An industry involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources, such as copper and timber, as well as by activities such as farming and fishing. A company in a primary industry can also be involved in turning natural resources into products.
Primary industry tends to make up a larger portion of the economy of developing countries than they do for developed countries. See also service industry, secondary industry.
The '''primary sector''' is concerned with the extraction of raw materials. It includes fishing, farming and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary sector of the economy|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/concepts/primary-sector/|website=Economics Help|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary industry is a larger sector in [[developing country|developing countries]]; for instance, [[animal husbandry]] is more common in countries in [[Africa]] than in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2554153|title=Review of The Primary Sector in Economic Development|first=C. D.|last=Scott|date=2 July 1986|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=53|issue=211|pages=414–416|doi=10.2307/2554153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining in 19th-century [[South Wales]] provides a case study of how an economy can come to rely on one form of activity.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm Mining: it's only a word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123191936/http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm |date=2007-01-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developed country|developed countries]] the primary industry has become more technologically advanced, for instance the mechanization of farming as opposed to hand picking and planting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more developed countries, additional capital is invested in primary means of production.  As an example, in the United States' [[corn belt]], [[combine harvester]]s pick the corn, and sprayers spray large amounts of [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[fungicide]]s, producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques.  These technological advances and investment allow the primary sector to require less workforce and, this way, developed countries tend to have a smaller percentage of their workforce involved in primary activities, instead having a higher percentage involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors.&lt;ref&gt;H Dwight H. Perkins: Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, Vol. 31, No. 1, China's Developmental Experience (Mar., 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed countries are allowed to maintain and develop their primary industries even further due to the excess wealth. For instance, European Union [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] provide buffers for the fluctuating inflation rates and prices of agricultural [[produce]]. This allows developed countries to be able to export their agricultural products at extraordinarily low prices.  This makes them extremely competitive against those of poor or underdeveloped countries that maintain free market policies and low or non-existent tariffs to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm WTO MINISTERIAL OUTCOME IMBALANCED AGAINST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823085546/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm Third World Farmers Hit by Unfair Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909232153/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/international/farmers10-08-2002.htm|title=U.S. subsidies help big business, but crush farmers from developing  countries|author=|date=|website=www.finalcall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such differences also come about due to more efficient production in developed economies, given farm machinery, better information available to farmers, and often larger scale.

'''Shortwave radio''' is [[radio]] transmission using shortwave [[radio frequencies]]. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the [[High frequency|high frequency band (HF)]], and generally extends from {{convert|1.7|–|30|MHz|m|abbr=on}}; from the high end of the [[Medium frequency|medium frequency band (MF)]] just above the [[mediumwave]] AM broadcast band, to the end of the [[High frequency|HF band]].

Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]]. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon.  This is called [[skywave]] or "skip" [[radio propagation|propagation]].  Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ([[line-of-sight propagation]]) and are limited by the visual horizon, about {{convert|40|miles|km}}.  Shortwave radio is used for [[broadcasting]] of voice and music to [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]] over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. It is also used for military [[over-the-horizon radar]], diplomatic communication, and two-way international communication by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts for hobby, educational and emergency purposes, as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications.

==Frequency classifications==
The widest popular definition of the shortwave frequency interval is the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1 (EU+Africa+Russia...)]] definition, and is the span 1.6–30&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]], just above the [[medium wave]] band, which ends approximately at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz.

There are also other definitions of the shortwave frequency interval:
* 1.71&amp;nbsp;to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz in [[ITU Region 2|ITU Region 2 (North and South America...)]]
* 1.8&amp;nbsp;(160&amp;nbsp;meter radio amateur band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz
* 2.3&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;meter band start) to 26.1&amp;nbsp;MHz (11&amp;nbsp;meter band end)&lt;ref&gt;Inconsistent article: [http://www.itwissen.info/definition/lexikon/Kurzwelle-SW-short-wave-KW.html itwissen.info: KW (Kurzwelle) SW (short wave)] Quote: "... Der KW-Frequenzbereich (SW) liegt zwischen 3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 30&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-1.&amp;nbsp;definition] ... Kurzwelle ist auch eine sendetechnische Bezeichnung für Rundfunk im Frequenzbereich zwischen 2,3&amp;nbsp;MHz und 26,1&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;[&lt;-2.&amp;nbsp;definition] ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtimeradio.de/lexikon.php oldtimeradio.de: Kleines Radio-Lexikon] Quote: "...

* In [[Germany]] and perhaps [[Austria]] the [[ITU Region 1|ITU Region&amp;nbsp;1]] shortwave radio frequency interval can be subdivided in:
** ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' ("border waves"): 1.605–3.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darc.de/distrikte/k/35/afu-frequenzen/ darc.de: Amateurfunk Frequenzen] Quote: "... Grenzwelle (Kurzwelle) ...", ''[[:de:Grenzwelle]]'' Quote: "... Als Grenzwelle wird der Frequenzbereich zwischen 1605&amp;nbsp;kHz und 3800&amp;nbsp;kHz bezeichnet, weil er auf der „Grenze" zwischen Mittelwelle und Kurzwelle liegt ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Germany these shortwave radio frequency intervals have also been seen used:
** the above other definitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/Grundig/diags.php Grundig Satellit 1000 TR6002], [http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/Grundig/large/CircuitDiagram.jpg schematic] See at the bottom of the schematic, just below the transformer. In the schematic it is written that the first shortwave band starts at 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (just after the band end of MW/AM): "KW1-SW1-OC1 1,6 .... 5,0&amp;nbsp;MHz"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Development===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|right|Radio amateurs carried out the first shortwave transmissions over a long distance before [[Guglielmo Marconi]]]]

The name "shortwave" originated during the early days of radio in the early 20th century, when the [[radio spectrum]] was considered divided into [[long wave]] (LW), [[medium wave]] (MW) and short wave bands based on the [[wavelength]] of the [[radio wave]]s. Shortwave radio received its name because the wavelengths in this band are relatively shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;m (1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz) which marked the original upper limit of the [[medium frequency]] band [[History of radio|first used]] for radio communications. The broadcast [[medium wave]] band now extends above the 200&amp;nbsp;m/1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz limit, and the [[amateur radio]] 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz&amp;nbsp;– 2.0&amp;nbsp;MHz band (known as the "[[top band]]") is the lowest-frequency band considered to be 'shortwave'. 

Early long distance [[radio telegraphy]] used [[long wave]]s, below 300&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] (kHz).  The drawbacks to this system included a very limited spectrum available for long distance communication, and the very expensive [[transmitter]]s, receivers and gigantic antennas that were required. It was also difficult to beam the radio wave directionally with long wave, resulting in a major loss of power over long distances.  Prior to the 1920s, the shortwave frequencies above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz were regarded as useless for long distance communication and were designated in many countries for amateur use.&lt;ref name="Nebeker2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederik|last=Nebeker|title=Dawn of the Electronic Age: Electrical Technologies in the Shaping of the Modern World, 1914 to 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwmH6-q5O5AC&amp;pg=PA157|date=6 May 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40974-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]], pioneer of radio, commissioned his assistant [[Charles Samuel Franklin]] to carry out a large scale study into the transmission characteristics of short wavelength waves and to determine their suitability for long distance transmissions. Franklin rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|first=John|last=Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75|isbn=9780852962183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1924, Marconi transmitted daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Franklin went on to refine the directional transmission, by inventing the [[curtain array]] aerial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ni7lDl3k5LwC&amp;dq=%22charles+samuel+franklin%22&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;q=charles+samuel+franklin|title=History of Telegraphy|first=K.

W.|last=Burns|year=1986|accessdate=2007-11-23|publisher=IET|isbn=0-86341-079-0|pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1924, Marconi entered into contracts with the British [[General Post Office]] (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]]. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/beyondionosphere00unitrich/beyondionosphere00unitrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Beyond the ionosphere : fifty years of satellite communication" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from [[Submarine communications cable|transoceanic cables]] and longwave wireless services to shortwave and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave stations had cost and efficiency advantages over massive longwave wireless installations,&lt;ref name="Hugill1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Hugill|title=Global Communications Since 1844: Geopolitics and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjfBkup-ccMC&amp;pg=PA129|date=4 March 1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6074-4|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some commercial longwave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s. Long distance radio circuits also reduced the load on the existing transoceanic telegraph cables and hence the need for new cables, although the cables maintained their advantages of high security and a much more reliable and better quality signal than shortwave.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/@carcbradio/cable-companies-595de8871f6b Cable and Wireless Plc History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320053915/http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 |date=2015-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless Ltd.]] in 1934.

Long-distance cables had a resurgence beginning in 1956 with the laying of TAT-1 across the Atlantic Ocean, the first voice frequency cable on this route. This provided 36 high quality telephone channels and was soon followed by even higher capacity cables all around the world. These sounded the death knell of shortwave radio for commercial communications.

===Amateur use of shortwave propagation===
[[File:Dial.png|thumb|right|[[Hallicrafters SX-28]] shortwave receiver analog tuning dial, circa 1944]]
[[Amateur radio|Amateur radio operators]] also discovered that long-distance communication was possible on shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used [[surface wave]] propagation at [[Very low frequency|very low frequencies]],&lt;ref&gt;Stormfax. [http://www.stormfax.com/wireless.htm Marconi Wireless on Cape Cod]&lt;/ref&gt; which are attenuated along the path at wavelengths shorter than 1,000&amp;nbsp;meters. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal loss. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs may have conducted the first successful transatlantic tests in December 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-club-of-america.org/history.php?page=1921.html |title=1921 – Club Station 1BCG and the Transatlantic Tests |accessdate=2009-09-05 |publisher=Radio Club of America }}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the 200&amp;nbsp;meter [[mediumwave]] band (near 1,500&amp;nbsp;kHz in the modern AM broadcast band) – the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe on 200&amp;nbsp;meters and at least 20&amp;nbsp;North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200&amp;nbsp;meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200&amp;nbsp;meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available [[vacuum tube]]s shortly after World War&amp;nbsp;I.

Extreme interference at the longer edge of the 150–200&amp;nbsp;meter band – the official wavelengths allocated to [[amateur radio operators|amateurs]] by the Second National Radio Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106763342;view=1up;seq=63 |title=Radio Service Bulletin No.&amp;nbsp;72, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–13 |accessdate=2009-09-05 |date=1923-04-02 |publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923 – forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150&amp;nbsp;meters (2&amp;nbsp;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications at wavelengths shorter than 150&amp;nbsp;meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100&amp;nbsp;meters (3&amp;nbsp;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130112737/http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 |date=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6,000&amp;nbsp;miles (9,600&amp;nbsp;km) and more. On 21&amp;nbsp;September 1924 several amateurs in California completed two-way contacts with an amateur in [[New Zealand]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90&amp;nbsp;minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On 10&amp;nbsp;October the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924conf.htm |title=Recommendations for Regulation of Radio: October&amp;nbsp;6–10, 1924 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[80-meter band|80&amp;nbsp;meters]] (3.75&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[40-meter band|40&amp;nbsp;meters]] (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[20-meter band|20&amp;nbsp;meters]] (14&amp;nbsp;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the [[10-meter band|10&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (28&amp;nbsp;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twiar.org/aaarchives/WB008.txt&lt;/ref&gt; on 25&amp;nbsp;November 1927. The [[15-meter band|15&amp;nbsp;meter band]] (21&amp;nbsp;MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1952.

==Propagation characteristics==
[[Image:Skip Zone Example.gif|thumb|right|Formation of a [[skip zone]]]]
Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by [[ionospheric reflection]] back to the earth by the [[ionosphere]], (a phenomenon known as "[[skywave]] propagation"). A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a [[skip zone]] where reception fails. With a fixed working frequency, large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night.

As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere, propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths,
[[Scattering|scattered]] by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops, a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques. Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band, absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer, the D layer, may impose a serious limit. This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules, absorbing some of a [[radio frequency]]'s energy and converting it to heat.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Rawer:"Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere". Kluwer, Dordrecht 1993 {{ISBN|0-7923-0775-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions of skywave propagation depend on:
* The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver.
* Time of day.  During the day, frequencies higher than approximately 12&amp;nbsp;MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones. At night, this property is reversed.
* With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer, the [[D layer|D Layer]], forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons.
* Season. During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres, the AM/MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness.
* [[Solar flare]]s produce a large increase in D region ionization so high, sometimes for periods of several minutes, all skywave propagation is nonexistent.

==Types of modulation==
{{Further|Modulation}}
[[Image:Shortwave Radio.jpg|thumb|right|National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver, circa 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shortwaveradio.ch/radio-e/panasonic-e.htm Panasonic/National] ShortwaveRadio.ch&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several different types of [[Modulation|modulation]] are used to incorporate information in a short-wave signal.

===Audio modes===
;AM
[[Amplitude modulation]] is the simplest type and the most commonly used for [[International broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]. The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal (speech, or music, for example). At the receiver, a simple [[detector (radio)|detector]] recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier.

;SSB
[[Single sideband]] transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the [[carrier frequency]]. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier, only the remaining set is transmitted. This reduces power in the transmission, as roughly {{frac|2|3}} of the energy sent by an AM signal is in the “carrier”, which is not needed to recover the information contained in the signal. It also reduces signal bandwidth, enabling less than one-half the AM signal bandwidth to be used.

The drawback is the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal. As a result, single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast. Single sideband is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, [[Citizen's Band]], and amateur radio operators. Lower sideband (LSB) is customarilly used below 9&amp;nbsp;MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9&amp;nbsp;MHz.

;VSB
[[Vestigal sideband]] transmits the carrier and one complete sideband, but filters out the other sideband. It is a compromise between AM and SSB, enabing simple receivers to be used, but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It can be heard in the transmission of certain radio [[time signal]] stations. [[Single sideband modulation#Vestigial sideband (VSB)|Vestigial sideband]] is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and [[8VSB|digital]].

;NFM
Narrow-band [[frequency modulation]] (NBFM or NFM) is used typically above 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. Because of the larger [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] required, NBFM is commonly used for [[VHF]] communication. Regulations limit the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a signal transmitted in the HF bands, and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth. NBFM is limited to short-range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian Robertson |last=Sinclair |title=Audio and Hi-Fi Handbook |publisher=Newnes |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7506-4975-5 |pages=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;DRM
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. It is a digital signal, like the data modes, below, but is for transmitting audio, like the analog modes above.

===Data modes===
;CW
[[Continuous wave]] (CW) is [[on-off keying|on-and-off keying]] of a carrier, used for [[Morse code]] communications and [[Hellschreiber]] [[facsimile]]-based [[teleprinter]] transmissions. It is a data mode, although often listed separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feld Hell Club |url=https://sites.google.com/site/feldhellclub/Home/feld-hell-faq |website=Google Sites |publisher=Google |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;RTTY, FAX, SSTV
[[Radioteletype]], fax, digital, [[slow-scan television]], and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software on a computer equipped with a sound card.

Note that on modern computer-driven systems, digital modes are typically sent by coupling a computer's sound output to the SSB input of a radio.

* [[International broadcasting]] primarily by government-sponsored [[propaganda]], international news (for example, the [[BBC World Service]]) or cultural stations to foreign audiences: the most common use of all.
* Domestic broadcasting: to widely dispersed populations with few [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]] and FM stations serving them; or for specialty political, religious and [[alternative media]] networks; or of individual commercial and non-commercial paid broadcasts.
* Oceanic [[air traffic control]] uses the HF/shortwave band for long distance communication to aircraft over the oceans and poles, which are far beyond the range of traditional [[VHF]] frequencies. Modern systems also include satellite communications, such as ADS-C/[[CPDLC]]
* [[Utility station|"Utility" stations]] transmitting messages not intended for the general public, such as merchant shipping, marine weather, and ship-to-shore stations; for aviation weather and air-to-ground communications; for military communications; for long-distance governmental purposes, and for other non-broadcast communications.
* [[Amateur radio]] operators at the [[80-meter band|80/75]], [[60-meter band|60]], [[40-meter band|40]], [[30-meter band|30]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[17-meter band|17]], [[15-meter band|15]], [[12-meter band|12]], and [[10-meter band|10-meter]] bands. Licenses are granted by authorized government agencies.
* [[Time signal]] and [[radio clock]] stations: In North America, [[WWV (radio station)|WWV radio]] and [[WWVH|WWVH radio]] transmit at these frequencies: 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 15&amp;nbsp;MHz; and WWV also transmits on 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. The [[CHU (radio station)|CHU radio station]] in Canada transmits on the following frequencies: 3.33&amp;nbsp;MHz, 7.85&amp;nbsp;MHz, and 14.67&amp;nbsp;MHz. Other similar [[radio clock]] stations transmit on various shortwave and longwave frequencies around the world. The shortwave transmissions are primarily intended for human reception, while the longwave stations are generally used for automatic synchronization of watches and clocks.

Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include:
* [[Clandestine radio|Clandestine stations]]. These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces. They may advocate civil war, insurrection, rebellion against the government-in-charge of the country to which they are directed. Clandestine broadcasts may emanate from transmitters located in rebel-controlled territory or from outside the country entirely, using another country's transmission facilities.&lt;ref name="Sterling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H. Sterling|title=Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA538|date=March 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45649-8|pages=538–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Numbers Station]]s. These stations regularly appear and disappear all over the shortwave radio band but are unlicensed and untraceable. It is believed that Numbers Stations are operated by government agencies and are used to communicate with clandestine operatives working within foreign countries. However, no definitive proof of such use has emerged. Because the vast majority of these broadcasts contain nothing but the recitation of blocks of numbers, in various languages, with occasional bursts of music, they have become known colloquially as "Number Stations". Perhaps the most noted Number Station is the [[Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station)|"Lincolnshire Poacher"]], named after the 18th century English folk song, which is transmitted just before the sequences of numbers.
* Unlicensed [[two way radio]] activity by individuals such as taxi drivers, bus drivers and fishermen in various countries can be heard on various shortwave frequencies. Such unlicensed transmissions by "pirate" or "bootleg" two way radio operators&lt;ref name="Magazines1940"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=January 1940|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; can often cause [[Co-channel interference|signal interference]] to licensed stations.&lt;ref name="IARU"&gt;{{cite web|title=IARU Monitoring System|url=http://www.iaru.org/monitoring-system.html|website=iaru.org|publisher=International Amateur Radio Union (IARU)|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pirate radio]] broadcasters who feature programming such as music, talk and other entertainment, can be heard sporadically and in various modes on the shortwave bands.&lt;ref name="Yoder2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Yoder|title=Pirate Radio Stations: Tuning in to Underground Broadcasts in the Air and Online|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMjT5wOX-d4C|year=2002|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-137563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Over-the-horizon radar]]: From 1976 to 1989, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Russian Woodpecker]] over-the-horizon radar system blotted out numerous shortwave broadcasts daily.
* [[Ionospheric heater]]s used for scientific experimentation such as the [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program]] in Alaska, and the [[Sura Ionospheric Heating Facility|Sura ionospheric heating facility]] in Russia.&lt;ref name="BychkovGolubkov2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Bychkov|author2=Gennady Golubkov|author3=Anatoly Nikitin|title=The Atmosphere and Ionosphere: Dynamics, Processes and Monitoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrSgz8l0EI0C&amp;pg=PA104|date=17 July 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-3212-6|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency allocations===
{{Main|Shortwave bands}}
The [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC), organized under the auspices of the [[International Telecommunication Union]], allocates bands for various services in conferences every few years. The last WRC took place in 2007.

At WRC-97 in 1997, the following bands were allocated for [[international broadcasting]]. AM shortwave broadcasting channels are allocated with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz separation for traditional analog audio broadcasting.

Although countries generally follow the table above, there may be small differences between countries or regions. For example, in the official bandplan of the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/frequentiebeleid/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2007/01/18/nationaal-frequentieplan-nfp.html|title=Nationaal Frequentieplan|author=|date=|website=rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 49 m band starts at 5.95&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 41 m band ends at 7.45&amp;nbsp;MHz, the 11 m band starts at 25.67&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the 120, 90 and 60 m bands are absent altogether. Additionally, international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC-allocated bands or use off-channel frequencies. This is done for practical reasons, or to attract attention in crowded bands (60m, 49m, 40m, 41m, 31m, 25m).

The new [[digital audio broadcasting]] format for shortwave [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] operates 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels. There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM, as it mainly transmitted in 10&amp;nbsp;kHz format.

The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and [[over-the-horizon radar]]. Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] designs (like the [[ALLISS]] antenna technology) to concentrate radio energy at the target area.

===Advantages===
[[File:Soviet SWL URS3-108-B.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Soviet union|Soviet]] shortwave listener in [[Borisoglebsk]], 1941]]
Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies, including the following:
* Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries: unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet, government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations (sites) are being listened to (accessed). For example, during the attempted coup against Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], when his access to communications was limited (e.g. his phones were cut off, etc.), Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the [[BBC World Service]] on shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld7078.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low-cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world. Simple shortwave [[regenerative receiver]]s can be easily built with a few parts.
* In many countries (particularly in most developing nations and in the [[Eastern bloc]] during the [[Cold War]] era) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Habrat| first = Marek| title = Odbiornik "Roksana" (Radio constructor's recollections)| url=http://oldradio.pl/karta_odb.php?nrmod=471| accessdate = 2008-08-05| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave).
* Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery-operated, making them useful in difficult circumstances. Newer technology includes [[hand-cranked radio]]s which provide power without batteries.
* Shortwave radios can be used in situations where [[Internet]] or [[satellite communications]] service is temporarily or long-term unavailable (or unaffordable).
* Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM (88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz). Shortwave broadcasts can be easily transmitted over a distance of several thousands of kilometers, including from one continent to another.
* Particularly in tropical regions, SW is somewhat less prone to interference from [[thunderstorms]] than [[medium wave|medium wave radio]], and is able to cover a large geographic area with relatively low power (and hence cost). Therefore, in many of these countries it is widely used for domestic broadcasting.
* Very little infrastructure is required for long-distance two-way communications using shortwave radio. All one needs is a pair of transceivers, each with an antenna, and a source of energy (such as a battery, a portable generator, or the electrical grid). This makes shortwave radio one of the most robust means of communications, which can be disrupted only by interference or bad ionospheric conditions. Modern digital transmission modes such as [[MFSK]] and [[Olivia MFSK|Olivia]] are even more robust, allowing successful reception of signals well below the [[noise floor]] of a conventional receiver.

===Disadvantages===
Shortwave radio's benefits are sometimes regarded as being outweighed by its drawbacks, including:
* In most Western countries, shortwave radio ownership is usually limited to true enthusiasts, since most new standard radios do not receive the shortwave band. Therefore, Western audiences are limited.
* In the developed world, shortwave reception is very difficult in urban areas because of excessive noise from [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode]] power adapters, fluorescent or LED light sources, internet modems and routers, computers and many other sources of [[radio interference]].

The Asia-Pacific Telecommunity estimates that there are approximately 600 million [[Shortwave receiver|shortwave broadcast-radio receivers]] in use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210001613/http://www.aptsec.org/meetings/2002/apg2003-4/(56)ABU.doc |date=February 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WWCR]] claims that there are 1.5 billion shortwave receivers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Arlyn T.

Many hobbyists listen to shortwave broadcasters. In some cases, the goal is to hear as many stations from as many countries as possible ''([[DXing]])''; others listen to specialized shortwave utility, or "ute", transmissions such as maritime, naval, aviation, or military signals. Others focus on intelligence signals from [[numbers stations]], stations which transmit strange broadcast usually for intelligence operations, or the two way communications by amateur radio operators. Some short wave listeners behave analogously to "lurkers" on the Internet, in that they listen only and never make any attempt to send out their own signals.  Other listeners participate in clubs, or actively send and receive QSL cards, or become involved with amateur radio and start transmitting on their own.

Many listeners tune the shortwave bands for the programmes of stations broadcasting to a general audience (such as [[Radio Taiwan International]], [[China Radio International]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio France Internationale]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Voice of Korea]], [[Radio Free Sarawak]] etc.). Today, through the evolution of the Internet, the hobbyist can listen to shortwave signals via remotely controlled or web controlled shortwave receivers around the world, even without owning a shortwave radio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dxing.com/webclink.htm Web-Controlled Radios] DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many international broadcasters offer live streaming audio on their websites and a number have closed their shortwave service entirely, or severely curtailed it, in favour of internet transmission.

Shortwave listeners, or SWLs, can obtain [[QSL card]]s from broadcasters, utility stations or amateur radio operators as trophies of the hobby. Some stations even give out special certificates, pennants, stickers and other tokens and promotional materials to shortwave listeners.

==Shortwave broadcasts and music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1994 WDR.jpg|thumb|right|Composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]]]
Some musicians have been attracted to the unique aural characteristics of shortwave radio which—due to the nature of amplitude modulation, varying propagation conditions, and the presence of interference—generally has lower fidelity than local broadcasts (particularly via FM stations). Shortwave transmissions often have bursts of distortion, and "hollow" sounding loss of clarity at certain aural frequencies, altering the harmonics of natural sound and creating at times a strange "spacey" quality due to echoes and phase distortion.  Evocations of shortwave reception distortions have been incorporated into rock and classical compositions, by means of delays or feedback loops, equalizers, or even playing shortwave radios as live instruments.  Snippets of broadcasts have been mixed into electronic sound collages and live musical instruments, by means of analogue [[tape loop]]s or [[digital sampler|digital samples]].  Sometimes the sounds of instruments and existing musical recordings are altered by remixing or equalizing, with various distortions added, to replicate the garbled effects of shortwave radio reception.&lt;ref name="Wörner1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Heinrich Wörner|title=Stockhausen; Life and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqmMPnlXZOMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02143-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sheppard|title=On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZluAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-107-2|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wire&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB5MAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=C. Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempts by serious composers to incorporate radio effects into music may be those of the Russian physicist and musician [[Léon Theremin]],&lt;ref name=Wire /&gt; who perfected a form of radio oscillator as a musical instrument in 1928 ([[regenerative circuit]]s in radios of the time were prone to breaking into [[oscillation]], adding various tonal [[harmonics]] to music and speech); and in the same year, the development of a French instrument called the [[Ondes Martenot]] by its inventor [[Maurice Martenot]], a French cellist and former wireless telegrapher. [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] used shortwave radio and effects in works including ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67), ''[[Kurzwellen]]'' (1968)—adapted for the Beethoven Bicentennial in ''Opus 1970'' with filtered and distorted snippets of Beethoven pieces—''[[Spiral (Stockhausen)|Spiral]]'' (1968), ''[[Pole (Stockhausen)|Pole]]'', ''[[Expo (Stockhausen)|Expo]]'' (both 1969–70), and ''[[Licht#Wednesday|Michaelion]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name="Wörner1973" /&gt;

[[Cyprus|Cypriot]] composer [[Yannis Kyriakides]] incorporated shortwave [[numbers station]] transmissions in his 1999 ''ConSPIracy cantata''.&lt;ref name="Dolp2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Dolp|title=Arvo Pärt's White Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8wnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=13 July 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-18289-9|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holger Czukay]], a student of Stockhausen, was one of the first to use shortwave in a [[rock music]] context.&lt;ref name="Sheppard2009" /&gt; In 1975, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] recorded a full length [[concept album]] around simulated radiowave and shortwave sounds, entitled ''[[Radioactivity (album)|Radio-Activity]]''.&lt;ref name="Barr2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Barr|title=Kraftwerk: from Dusseldorf to the Future With Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mcj4h2qEhQC&amp;pg=PT98|date=31 August 2013|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-7776-9|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The The]]'s Radio Cineola monthly broadcasts drew heavily on shortwave radio sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php Radio Cineola] www.thethe.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218173001/http://www.thethe.com/sections/radio.php |date=December 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortwave's future==
[[File:Penny Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|PC spectrum display of a modern [[software defined radio|software defined]] shortwave receiver]]
{{Further|Shortwave listening#Future of shortwave listening}}

The development of direct broadcasts from satellites has reduced the demand for shortwave receiver hardware, but there are still a great number of shortwave broadcasters. A new [[digital radio]] technology, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), is expected to improve the quality of shortwave audio from very poor to standards comparable to the FM broadcast band.&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt; The future of shortwave radio is threatened by the rise of [[power line communication]] (PLC), also known as [[Broadband over Power Lines]] (BPL), which uses a data stream transmitted over unshielded power lines. As the BPL frequencies used overlap with shortwave bands, severe distortions can make listening to analog shortwave radio signals near power lines difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="HrasnicaHaidine2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halid Hrasnica|author2=Abdelfatteh Haidine|author3=Ralf Lehnert|title=Broadband Powerline Communications: Network Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d270N6yvWCoC&amp;pg=PA34|date=14 January 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85742-7|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts disagree on the future of shortwave. According to Andy Sennitt, former editor of the [[World Radio TV Handbook]], “shortwave is a legacy technology, which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly. A few countries are hanging on to it, but most have faced up to the fact that the glory days of shortwave have gone. Religious broadcasters will still use it because they are not too concerned with listening figures".&lt;ref name="RW" /&gt;

However Thomas Witherspoon, editor of shortwave news site SWLingPost.com wrote that “shortwave remains the most accessible international communications medium that still provides listeners with the protection of complete anonymity". According to Nigel Fry, head of Distribution for the [[BBC World Service]] Group, “I still see a place for shortwave in the 21st century, especially for reaching areas of the world that are prone to natural disasters that destroy local broadcasting and Internet infrastructure".&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Careless|first1=James|title=The Evolution of Shortwave Radio|url=http://www.radioworld.com/digital-radio/0014/the-evolution-of-shortwave-radio/338422|website=Radio World|publisher=NewBay Media|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|title=Just Spell US Right: America’s News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

The United States and Europe have consistently been sources of influence and soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joseph Nye|title=Europe’s Soft Power|url=http://www.theglobalist.com/europes-soft-power/|publisher=The Globalist|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=3 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European culture]]'s art, literature, music, design, fashion, and even food have been global magnets for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Europe and the U.S. have often claimed to support [[human rights]] and [[international law]] throughout the world.

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel.

''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.&lt;ref name="francemonocle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time. For instance, France was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s main role model for [[Westernization]] as part of the major reform efforts that he spearheaded when he was President of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Soner Cagaptay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=french+laicit%C3%A9+turkey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz_UaAWfWN&amp;sig=NAEle23Sl5HmUbOS2mjT-NnAl0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA45fHrbXJAhXH8RQKHfvKAIwQ6AEIWzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20laicit%C3%A9%20turkey&amp;f=false The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power], pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B.

Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H.

Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. [[Milan]] is a  [[fashion capital]] of the World. [[Venice]], with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the [[Venetian Carnival]] and the [[Biennale]].

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s.

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[France]], public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 BBC Country Ratings|url=http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf|publisher=Globescan/BBC World Service|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes alongside a rapid growth in the total value of cultural exports which rose to US$4.2 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Christian|title=South Korea's K-pop takes off in the west|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ddf11662-53c7-11e1-9eac-00144feabdc0.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

[[File:Banksy, Hewlett Road, Cheltenham (1) (geograph 3944289) (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Spy Booth'' in 2014]]
'''''Spy Booth''''' was an artwork by [[Banksy]] in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBCJun14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28032154|title=Fears Banksy Cheltenham 'spies' artwork will be removed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece has been seen as a critique of the [[global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Morris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/10/banksy-creator-spy-booth-wall-art-gchq|title=Banksy confirms he is creator of Spy Booth wall art near GCHQ |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robin Barton and [[Bankrobber London]] helped with the preservation of the artwork,&lt;ref name=BBCJun29_6_14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28078938 |title=Cheltenham Banksy: Deal to save it 'close to agreement'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to broker the removal and sale of the piece. However the artwork was painted onto a Grade II [[listed building]] - [[153-159 Fairview Road]] - and the council prevented it from being removed, giving it retrospective listed building consent in 2015 and affording it some protection from removal. Despite this, the artwork was either removed or destroyed in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-37148473&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GCHQ]] has used the picture on its website as a symbolic image for its "what we do" page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gchq.gov.uk/what_we_do/Pages/index.aspx |title=What we do |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X3QPB3fH |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Transnational organization''' is a term used in scholarly literature. It refers to [[international organization]]s (usually, [[international nongovernmental organization]]s) that "transcend" the idea of a [[nation-state]].

The distinction between an international and a '''transnational organization''' is unclear and has been criticized by some scholars (ex. Colás, 2002).

Transnational relations have been defined as “contacts, coalitions, and interactions across state boundaries that are not controlled by the central foreign policy organs of governments.”  Examples of transnational entities are “multinational business enterprises and revolutionary movements; trade unions and scientific networks; international air transport cartels and communications activities in outer space.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye, Jr.|first=Joseph S.|author2=Robert O. Keohane|title=Transnational Relations and World Politics: An Introduction|journal=International Organization|year=1971|volume=25|issue=3|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/sdrelint/ficheros_materiales/materiales016.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=331|doi=10.1017/s0020818300026187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transnational social movements are “the broad tendencies that often manifest themselves in particular [[International non-governmental organization|International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs)]].”  Examples of transnational social movements include human rights, women’s, peace, labor, green, or student movements manifested in [[Amnesty International]], the [[Peace Brigades International]], the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=Transnational social movements: an assessment|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/cohen.pdf|publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Warwick|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further definition: “An organization is "transnational" rather than "national" if it carries on significant centrally-directed operations in the territory of two or more nation-states. Similarly, an organization will be called "international" rather than "national" only if the control of the organization is explicitly shared among representatives of two or more nationalities. And an organization is "multinational" rather than "national" only if people from two or more nationalities participate significantly in its operation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=336|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Transnational organizations are designed to facilitate the pursuit of a single interest within many national units.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=338|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Progressivism}}
'''Transnational progressivism''' is a term [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Hudson Institute]] Fellow [[John Fonte]] in 2001 to describe an [[ideology]] which endorses a concept of postnational [[global citizen]]ship and promotes the authority of international institutions over the sovereignty of individual nation-states.&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;

==Overview==

Fonte argued that the core beliefs of this view include:

*Advocating the goals of an identity group rather than individual:  "The key political unit is not the individual citizen...but the ascriptive group (racial, ethnic, or gender) into which one is born."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/archives_roll/2002_04-06/fonte_ideological/fonte_ideological.html "The Ideological War Within the West,"] ''Watch on the West'', Volume 3, Number 6, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf "Liberal Democracy vs. Transnational Progressivism: The Future of the Ideological Civil War Within the West,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202204141/http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Orbis'', Summer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"&gt;John Fonte, [http://www.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=31179 "Global Governance vs. the Liberal Democratic Nation-State,"] ''Front Page Magazine'', June 04, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*An oppressor/victim dichotomy: "Transnational ideologists have incorporated the essentially [[Hegel]]ian [[Marxist]] "privileged vs. marginalized" dichotomy," with "immigrant groups designated as victims."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Proportional representation by group:  "Transnational progressivism assumes that "victim" groups should be represented in all professions roughly proportionate to their percentage of the population. If not, there is a problem of "underrepresentation."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Change in institutional values:  "the distinct worldviews of ethnic, gender, and linguistic minorities must be represented" within dominant social and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Change in the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] [[paradigm]]:  "The traditional paradigm based on the assimilation of immigrants into an existing American civic culture is obsolete and must be changed to a framework that promotes "diversity," defined as group proportionalism."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Redefinition of democracy:  "Changing the system of majority rule among equal citizens to one of power sharing among ethnic groups composed of both citizens and non-citizens."&lt;ref name="Fonte May 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2008"/&gt;
*Deconstruction of Western national narratives and national symbols in favor of post-modern multiculturalist views.&lt;ref name="Fonte Orbis 2002"/&gt;

==Transnational progressivism in fiction==
In [[John Ringo]]'s [[military science fiction]] series [[Legacy of the Aldenata]], the Aldenata are described disparagingly as "galactic tranzis".

[[Tom Kratman]] references tranzi in "Caliphate", a near future science fiction novel.  In the afterword, which is not fiction, he describes how the tranzi's policy of appeasement and inertia cause the subjection of Europe to Islamic control.

{{Marxism|History}}
{{Left communism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''World revolution''' is the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of overthrowing [[capitalism]] in all countries through the [[class consciousness|conscious]] revolutionary action of the organized [[working class]]. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a [[revolutionary party]] to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a [[workers' state]] based on [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. In most Marxist schools, such as [[Trotskyism]], the essentially international character of the [[class struggle]] and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of [[socialism in one country]].

The end goal of such internationally oriented [[revolutionary socialism]] is to achieve [[world socialism]], and later, [[stateless communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1933/teaching/4.htm The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism] by [[Bukharin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm The State and Revolution — Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist movements==
The [[October Revolution]] of 1917  in Russia sparked a [[revolutionary wave]] of [[socialist]] and [[communist]] uprisings across Europe, most notably the [[German Revolution]], the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungarian Revolution]], [[Biennio Rosso]] and the [[Finnish Civil War|revolutionary war in Finland]] with the short lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also [[Revolutions of 1917-23]].

Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that [[capitalism]] would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the [[Comintern]], founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the [[Russian Civil War]] into an essentially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide.

With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see ''[[Socialism in one country]]''.

After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again.
As [[fascism]] grew in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the [[Comintern]] opted for a [[Popular Front]] with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of [[World War II]] in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's [[Western world|Western]] allies.

===After World War II===
A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the [[aftermath of World War II]], though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], [[France]], and [[Italy]] had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of [[anti-fascist]] resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in [[Eastern Europe]], meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power.  Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], who also were integral in repelling fascism during World War II.

Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], the establishment of the [[New Left]] together with the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the militancy of the [[Black Panther Party]] and similar armed/insurrectionary "Liberation Front" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the [[labor movement]] for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, "The East is Red, and the West is Ready". However, this [[Far left|radical left]] spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain [[right-wing]], economically [[conservatism|conservative]] ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by [[Thatcherism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Reaganomics]] in the [[United States]]) and also [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|free-market reforms in China]] and [[doi moi|in Vietnam]].

Within [[Marxist theory]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s concept of the [[labor aristocracy]] and his description of [[imperialism]], and{{spaced ndash}}separately, but not necessarily unrelatedly{{spaced ndash}}[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s theories regarding the [[deformed workers' state]], offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of [[proletarian internationalism]].
