The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

== Current Model ==
The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005). Measuring help-seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, 39(1), 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M., McLean, J. P., &amp; Sheffield, J. (2009). Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes. Archives of Suicide Research, 13(3), 264-276. doi: 10.1080/13811110903044419. {{PMID|19591000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apophatic theology''', also known as '''negative theology''',{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} is a form of [[theology|theological]] thinking and religious practice which attempts to [[Problem of religious language|approach God]], the Divine, by [[negation]], to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is [[God]].{{r|Bunnin_Yu|group=web}} It forms a pair together with [[cataphatic theology]], which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God ''is''.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}

The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of [[mysticism]], which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of [[Perception|ordinary perception]].{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=84–87}}

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it. Clear your minds and listen to my words."''{{r|Chinul|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also {{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press}}}} initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}} In the ''[[Enneads]]'' Plotinus writes: 
{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}

===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states: 
{{quote|For we explain not what God is but candidly confess that we have not exact knowledge concerning Him. For in what concerns God to confess our ignorance is the best knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cyril |first=Archbishop of Jerusalem |author-link=Cyril of Jerusalem |contribution=Catechetical Homilies, VI §2 |year=c. 335 |publication-date=1994 |title=Nicene and Ante-Nicene Fathers (2nd Series) |editor-last=Schaff |editor-first=Philip |editor-link=Philip Schaff |volume=VII |page=33 |place=Peabody, Mass. |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers, Inc. |isbn= |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf207.ii.x.html |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430) defined God ''aliud, aliud valde'', meaning "other, completely other", in ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' 7.10.16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Vessey |title=A Companion to Augustine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U8JIm4U05I4C |accessdate=3 July 2016 |year=2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |id={{ISBN|1-405-15946-4}}|isbn=978-1-405-15946-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=wkuVBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22aliud,+aliud+valde%22%22%287.10.16%29%22+Confessions+%22other,+completely+other%22 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

===Eastern Orthodox Christianity===
{{Main|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century [[Cappadocian Fathers]]{{refn|group=note|[[Basil the Great]] (330–379), who was bishop of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]; Basil's younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c.332–395), who was bishop of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]]; and a close friend, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (329–389), who became [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] this existence, is uncreated. The [[essence]] of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His [[Energies of God|energies]].&lt;ref name="McGinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGinn |first=Bernard |chapter=4.

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

[[Ivan Illich]] (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called "Why Philia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pudel.uni-bremen.de/pdf/Hoinacki_Clar04_Philia_philia_en.pdf Hoinacki, Lee].&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

[[Karen Armstrong]], in her book ''[[The Case for God]]'' (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in [[postmodern theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |title=All quiet on the God front|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maimonides-2.jpg|thumb|left|Maimonides]]

[[Maimonides]] (1135/1138-1204) was "the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the ''via negativa''."{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} Maimonides, but also [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]], draw on [[Bahya ibn Paquda]],{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|absolute unity]]. God, as the entity which is "truly One" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and [[Divine simplicity|indescribable]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that "[God] is knowledge," and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, "a perfect unity and not a composite at all."&lt;ref name="Wineberg"/&gt; Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating
{{quote|This [form of unity] wherein G‑d’s knowledge and so on is one with G‑d Himself is beyond the capacity of the mouth to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and beyond the capacity of the heart of man to apprehend clearly.&lt;ref name="Wineberg"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7994 ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah Ch. 8]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' Maimonides stated:
{{quote|God's existence is absolute and it includes no composition and we comprehend only the fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false assumption to hold that He has any positive [[Abstraction|attribute]] [...] still less has He accidents (מקרה), which could be described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive attribute however, the negative attributes are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must believe [...] When we say of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is impossible; it is living &amp;mdash; it is not dead; [...] it is the first &amp;mdash; its existence is not due to any cause; it has power, wisdom, and will &amp;mdash; it is not feeble or ignorant; [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|He is One]] &amp;mdash; there are not more Gods than one [...] Every attribute predicated of God denotes either the quality of an action, or, when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself &amp;mdash; and not of His actions &amp;mdash; the [[negation]] of the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp.htm 1:58]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

=== History ===
{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''Sa''.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''Sa'' ≠ ''Sb''.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers ("''[[Mathematical induction#Axiom of induction|Induction axiom]]''").

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Comstock–Needham system''' is a naming system for [[insect]] [[Insect wing|wing]] [[veins]], devised by [[John Henry Comstock|John Comstock]] and [[James George Needham|George Needham]] in 1898. It was an important step in showing the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of all [[insect wings]]. This system was based on Needham's ''pretracheation theory'' that was later discredited by [[Frederic Charles Fraser]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, F. C.  1938.  A note on the fallaciousness of the theory of pretracheation in the venation of Odonata.  ''Proc. Roy. Ent. Soc. London'' (A) 13: 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vein terminology==

===Longitudinal veins===
[[Image:Comstock-needham.svg|thumb|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock–Needham system|400px|right]]The Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the [[anterior]] (leading) edge of the wing towards the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (rear), the major [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] veins are named:
*{{anchor|costa}}''costa'' '''C''', meaning ''rib''
*{{anchor|subcosta}}''subcosta'' '''Sc''', meaning ''below the rib''
*{{anchor|radius}}''radius'' '''R''', in analogy with a bone in the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]]
*{{anchor|media}}''media'' '''M''', meaning ''middle''
*{{anchor|cubitus}}''cubitus'' '''Cu''', meaning ''elbow''
*{{anchor|anal veins}}''anal veins'' '''A''', in reference to its posterior location

Apart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the {{anchor|subcostal vein}}subcostal vein will be called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The {{anchor|radial veins}}radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the '''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and posteriorly the ''radial sector'' '''Rs'''. The radial sector may fork twice.

The media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.

According to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the {{anchor|cubital vein}}cubital veins Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
According to some other authorities, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may fork again, producing the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;.

As there are several anal veins, they are called '''A1''', '''A2''', and so on. They are usually unforked.

===Crossveins===
Crossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed '''m-cu'''). Some crossveins have their own name, like the [[humeral]] crossvein '''h''' and the sectoral crossvein '''s'''.

==Cell terminology==
The cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

In the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed "first R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and the distal cell "second R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".

If a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
* 1989: [[Christopher Williams (American artist)|Christopher Williams]]' ''Angola to Vietnam'' is first exhibited. The work consists of a series of black-and-white photographs of glass botanical specimens from the [[Botanical Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], chosen according to a list of the thirty-six countries in which political disappearances were known to have taken place during the year 1985.

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''''''conceptual schema'''''' is a high-level description of a business's informational needs.  It typically includes only the main concepts and the main relationships among them.  Typically this is a first-cut model, with insufficient detail to build an actual database. This level describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users. The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets on describing entities, datatype, relationships and constraints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Data Modelling Tutorial", Stefano Grazioli, University of Virginia, {{cite web|url=http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702034254/http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}, retrieved 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

A '''conceptual schema''' or '''conceptual [[data model]]''' is a map of [[concept]]s and their [[Relational model|relationships]] used for [[database]]s.  This describes the [[semantics]] of an organization and represents a series of [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s about its nature.  Specifically, it describes the things of significance to an [[organization]] (''entity classes''), about which it is inclined to collect information, and characteristics of (''attributes'') and associations between pairs of those things of significance (''relationships'').

Because a conceptual schema represents the semantics of an organization, and not a [[database design]], it may exist on various levels of abstraction.  The original [[ANSI]] four-schema architecture began with the set of ''external schema'' that each represent one person's view of the world around him or her.  These are consolidated into a single ''conceptual schema'' that is the superset of all of those external views.  A data model can be as concrete as each person's perspective, but this tends to make it inflexible.  If that person's world changes, the model must change.  Conceptual data models take a more abstract perspective, identifying the fundamental things, of which the things an individual deals with are just examples.

The model does allow for what is called [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] in [[object oriented]] terms.  The set of [[Instantiation (computer science)|instance]]s of an entity class may be subdivided into entity classes in their own right.  Thus, each instance of a ''sub-type'' entity class is also an instance of the entity class's ''super-type''. Each instance of the super-type entity class, then is also an instance of one of the sub-type entity classes.

[[supertype|Super-type]]/[[subtype|sub-type]] relationships may be ''[[exclusive relationship (programming)|exclusive]]'' or not. A methodology may require that each instance of a super-type may ''only'' be an instance of ''one'' sub-type. Similarly, a super-type/sub-type relationship may be ''exhaustive'' or not. It is exhaustive if the methodology requires that each instance of a super-type ''must be'' an instance of a sub-type. A sub-type named other is often necessary.

==Example relationships==
* Each PERSON may be ''the vendor in'' one or more ORDERS.
* Each ORDER must be ''from'' one and only one PERSON.
* PERSON is ''a sub-type of'' PARTY.  (Meaning that every instance of PERSON is also an instance of PARTY.)
* Each EMPLOYEE may have a ''supervisor'' who is also an EMPLOYEE.

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon.

The '''Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness''' is a hypothesis by [[Timothy Leary]], and later expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]], that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). Info-Psychology. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; The eight circuits, or eight "brains" as referred by other authors, operate within the human nervous system, each corresponding to its own imprint and direct experience of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Wilson, Alli, et al. (1977-95)&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and Alli include three stages for each circuit that details developmental points for each level of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alli, A. (2009). The Eight-Circuit Brain. Vertical Pool publishing, Berkeley, CA. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first four circuits deal with life on earth, and survival of the species. The last four circuits are post-terrestrial, and deal with the evolution of the species, [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] states of mind, and [[psychic]] abilities.  The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized.  Leary describes the first four as "larval circuits", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially.&lt;ref&gt;"Info-Psychology," Chapter 12, Timothy Leary, 1994, New Falcon Publications, Phoenix, Arizona, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization.

The term "circuit" is equated to a metaphor of the brain being [[computer hardware]], and that the wiring of the brain as [[circuitry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A.(1983). ''Prometheus Rising.'' New Falcon Publications, Reno, NV. Twenty-first Printing, (2009). Pgs. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary uses the eight circuits along with [[recapitulation theory]] to explain the evolution of the human species, the personal development of an individual, and the [[biological evolution]] of all life.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eight Circuits==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

Each circuit listed has each name from Leary's book "Exo-Psychology" after the preface,&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilson's book "Quantum Psychology" pgs.196-201.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; ''Note:In other books from Leary, Wilson, and Alli, the eight circuits have different names due to different interpretations and findings of each author. Please reference bibliography section for other works on labeling of each circuit.''

===1. (Leary)The vegetative-invertebrate circuit (Wilson)The oral bio-survival circuit&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===

This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival,  [[suckling]], cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] early in infancy. The imprint will normally last for life unless it is re-imprinted by a powerful experience. Depending on the nature of the imprint, the organism will tend towards one of two basic attitudes:
*A positive imprint sets up a basic attitude of trust. The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're not ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[oral stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psychosexual development]], and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong [[opioid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prometheus Rising, pg. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. (Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit (Wilson)The anal territorial circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.

The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states:
*Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an '[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of [[Fritz Perls]], to 'I'm OK' in the  [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]], and to [[Master–slave morality|master morality]] in the model of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Submissive, co-operative behavior.  Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'.

This circuit is activated by [[depressant]] drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[anal stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psycho-sexual development]]. This circuit introduces a 2nd spatial dimension; up/down.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/raw1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits:

*Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're OK]]. Friendly strength in the [[Interpersonal Circumplex]]. [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] in the [[Classical element|four elements model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Choleric in the [[Humorism|four humors model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're OK]]. Friendly weakness. [[Water (classical element)|Water]] in the four elements model. Phlegmatic humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly strength. [[Air (classical element)|Air]] in the four elements model. Sanguine humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly weakness. [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] in the four elements model. Melancholic humor.

===3. (Leary)The laryngeal-manual symbolic circuit (Wilson)The semantic time-binding circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental "map" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc.

This circuit is activated by [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[cathinone]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[caffeine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit supposedly appeared first when [[hominid]]s started differentiating from the rest of the [[primates]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], being heavily influenced by [[General Semantics]], writes of this circuit as the 'time-binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents&amp;nbsp;– including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved [[meme]]tically and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication.

===4. (Leary)The socio-sexual domestication circuit (Wilson)The socio-sexual circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first [[orgasm]]-mating experiences and tribal "morals". It is concerned with [[sexual pleasure]] (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", [[reproduction]], rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within [[society|social networks]]. This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. Some have pointed out that [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]]s such as [[MDMA]] seem to meet some of the requirements needed to activate this circuit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, [[somatic reprogramming]], etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A., "Quantum Psychology" (1990). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth circuit is consciousness of the [[Human body|body]]. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing [[aesthetic]] sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. Page V-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Experience of this circuit often accompanies an [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.

This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Hatha Yoga]], [[tantra]] and [[Zen meditation]]. Robert Anton Wilson writes, "Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the [[upper class]]es, with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC.

===6. (Leary)The neuro-electric circuit (Wilson)The metaprogramming circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
''Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). "Neuropolitics". Starseed Peace Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Prometheus Rising", Robert Anton Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In the subsequently published "Quantum Psychology", he reverted this back to the order proposed by Leary.''&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Seventh Printing, (2003). Page 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of "realities" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables [[Telepathy|telepathic communication]] and is activated by low-to-moderate doses of [[LSD]] (50-150&amp;nbsp;µg), moderate doses of [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===7. (Leary)The neurogenetic circuit (Wilson)The morphogenetic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific [[DNA]]-[[Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of [[past lives]], [[reincarnation]], [[immortality]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the [[collective unconscious]] in the models of [[Carl Jung]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; where archetypes reside.

Activation of this circuit may be equated with consciousness of the [[Pan (god)|Great God Pan]] in his aspect as Life as a whole, or with consciousness of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], the biosphere considered as a single organism.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is activated by higher doses of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (200-500&amp;nbsp;µg), higher doses of [[peyote]], higher doses of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, yoga and [[meditation]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The circuit first appeared among the [[Hindus]] in the early first millennium and later reappeared among the [[Sufi cosmology|Sufi]] sects.

===8. (Leary)The neuro-atomic metaphysiological (Wilson)The non-local quantum circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The eighth circuit is concerned with [[Quantum mind|quantum consciousness]], [[Quantum entanglement|non-local awareness]] (information from beyond ordinary [[space-time]] awareness which is limited by the [[speed of light]]),  illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], shock, a [[near-death experience]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], high doses of LSD and according to Robert Anton Wilson almost any dose of ketamine.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE0gRbyXllI&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL8F393A80E80263B3" Robert Anton Wilson - 8 Circuit Psychology 6/7] 01/12/2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This circuit has even been compared to the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[Indra's net]] from the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Leary's contribution==
Leary stated "They[The theories presented in ''Info-Psychology''] are scientific in that they are based on empirical findings from physics, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, astronomy, behavioral psychology, information science, and most importantly, neurology." &lt;ref&gt;Info-Psychology, pg 8., seventh printing, 2011 or Info-Psychology, pg. 7, third printing, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary called his book "science faction" or "psi-phy" and noted he had written it "in various prisons to which the author had been sentenced for dangerous ideology and violations of Newtonian and religious laws".&lt;ref&gt;''Info-Psychology, p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Leary propounded the basic premise of eight "brains" or brain circuits, he was inspired by sources such as the [[Hindu]] ''[[chakra]]'' system.

Leary claimed that among other things this model explained the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social conflict in the 1960s]], where the mainstream was said to be those with four circuits active and characterized by Leary as tribal moralists and clashed with the [[counter-culture|counter-culturists]], who were then said to be those with the fifth circuit active and characterized as [[individualists]] and [[hedonism|hedonists]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Leary's first book on the subject, ''Neurologic'', only included seven circuits when it was published in 1973. ''Exo-Psychology'', published in 1977, expanded the number of circuits to eight and clarified the subject. In it, he puts forward the theory that the later four circuits are "post terrestrial;" intended to develop as we migrate off this planet and colonize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leary|first= Timothy|date= 1977|title= Exo-Psychology|location= Los Angeles|publisher= Starseed/Peace Press Inc.|page= 103|isbn=0-915238-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once we begin space migration, according to Leary, we will have more ready access to these higher circuits. ''Exo-Psychology'' was re-published as revised by Timothy Leary with additional material in 1989 under the title ''Info-Psychology'' (New Falcon Publishing).

==Other authors on the eight circuits==
[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|130px|In [[chaos magic]] the eight circuits are sometimes related to the eight rays of the [[symbol of chaos]]]]
Leary's ideas heavily influenced the work of [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson's book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' is an in-depth work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Wilson's published screenplay ''[[Reality Is What You Can Get Away With]]'' uses and explains the model. Wilson, like Leary, wrote about the distinction between terrestrial and post-terrestrial life.

''Angel Tech'' by [[Antero Alli]], is structured around the Eight-circuit model of consciousness. Alli defines the word angel as "a being of light" and tech from the word "techne" meaning "art". The title is defined as "the art of being light".&lt;ref&gt;Alli, Antero. (1985) "Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection" New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes suggested activities such as [[meditation]]s and construction of [[Tarot|tarot-card]] collages associated with each circuit and imprint.

The model is fairly prominent in [[chaos magic]]. This concept has been detailed in ''"Chaotopia!"'' by [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], a leading member of the magic society [[Illuminates of Thanateros]]. Leary and Wilson were also members of the society. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Rolf Von Eckartsberg also appears to have been influenced by the model.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eckartsberg, R. (1981a). "Maps of the mind". In Valle, R. &amp; von Eckarsberg, R. ''The metaphors of consciousness''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthportals.com/Portal_Messenger/bohm2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle with an antimatter beam at CERN|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2015|volume=631|issue=1|page=012047|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/631/i=1/a=012047|bibcode = 2015JPhCS.631a2047K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/631/1/012047 |last1=Kimura|first1=M.|last2=Aghion|first2=S.|last3=Amsler|first3=C.|last4=Ariga|first4=A.|last5=Ariga|first5=T.|last6=Belov|first6=A.|last7=Bonomi|first7=G.|last8=Bräunig|first8=P.|last9=Bremer|first9=J.|last10=Brusa|first10=R.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16265">There are a number of meanings for the term [[humanitarian]].  Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating [[suffering]].  It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict.  '''Humanitarian principles''' govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.

==Core humanitarian principles==

===Humanity===
The principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody3  Pictet (1979) Humanity]. [[Jean Pictet|Pictet's]] commentary is focused on the Red Cross use of the principle of humanity, but includes more general comments relevant to the whole humanitarian sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Imperative===
The [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance.  It states the obligation of the international community "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed."&lt;ref&gt;For a critical view see: Hugo Slim, "Relief agencies and moral standing in war: principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and solidarity, Development in Practice, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4/August 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality===
Provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] must be [[impartiality|impartial]] and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.  It must be based on need alone.

For most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO.  However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;(See:  [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping]] (Brahimi report)pp. ix &amp; 9){{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114055129/http://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Humanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.

Problems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors.  Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities.  The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments  through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.&lt;ref&gt;(see: [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1996_3/18-19.html Joanna Macrae: NGOs: Has the 'N' gone missing?] [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1998_2/2-7.html Randolph Kent: Footing the aid bill])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining principles===
The core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.

==Additional humanitarian principles==
In addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.

===Neutrality===
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality.  For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

The principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to "engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature."  The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.

[[neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]] can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state.  "Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing.  GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature.  According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of the concept of neutrality with respect to humanitarian response see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z Denise Plattner])&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone.  Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.

===Proselytism===
The provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds.  All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.

==Principles based on field experience in emergencies==
All of the above principles are important requirements for  effective field operations.  They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response.  In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.

If a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger.  If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.

==Sources==
The core principles, found in the [[Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct]] and in GA Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality—in the case of the UN), and IV (independence).&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of their background and a commentary on the principles see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5mje9n Jean Pictet 1979])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian accountability ==
Accountability has been defined as: "the processes through which an organisation makes a 
commitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, Robert M. |author2=Monica Blagescu |author3=Lucy de las Casas |title=Pathways to Accountability: The Gap Framework |publisher=One World Trust |location= |year=2005 |pages= 5|isbn=0-9504434-6-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=dtrust.org/documents/Pathways_to_Accountability,_A_Short_Guide_to_the_GAP_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] adds: "Accountability is about using power responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/other/faq.aspx#top|title=HAPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] states:
"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries.  However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly "upward accountability", i.e. to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anderson: {{cite web |url=http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180533/http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries.  Examples include the [[Sphere Project]], [[ALNAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/|title=ALNAP - Home|website=www.alnap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103064539/http://www.compasqualite.org/en/index/index.php|title=Quality COMPAS - Homepage|date=3 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[People In Aid]] Code of Good Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleinaid.org/code/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], which runs a "global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies."

==Additional principles==
The RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience  with development assistance.
*Agencies should operate with respect to culture and custom
*Humanitarian response should use local resources and capacities as much as possible
*The participation of the beneficiaries should be encouraged
*Emergency response should strive to reduce future vulnerabilities
*Agencies should be accountable to both donors and beneficiaries
*Humanitarian agencies should use information activities to portray victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects

==The right to life with dignity==
The Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Sphere Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the language of human rights to remind that the [[right to life]] which is proclaimed in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] is related to [[human dignity]].

==Vulnerability and behavioral issues==
Humanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations.  However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] of those affected by war and violence.  Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.

===Sexual exploitation and abuse===
One of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation and abuse]] of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers.  In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

A number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses.  In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment.  The plan explicitly prohibited the "Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour."  The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;(See:[http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex IASC, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120184234/http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex |date=2006-11-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Substantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The [[People In Aid#The People In Aid Code of Good Practice|People In Aid Code of Good Practice]], an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.

Structures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.

The RC/NGO Code is self-enforcing. The [[SCHR]] carries out peer reviews among its members which look in part at the issue of compliance with principles set out in the RC/NGO Code

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met. Copyright in such a case protects the particular literary or pictorial expression chosen by the author.

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

'''''Idios kosmos''''' comes from Greek and means private world. It exists with, and is opposite to, '''''koinos kosmos''''' (shared world). ''Idios kosmos'' is the view of the world that is developed from personal experience and knowledge and is therefore unique; however, it can be difficult to tell the difference between it and ''koinos kosmos''.

The two phrases come from the [[Diels–Kranz numbering system|Diels-Kranz]] fragment B89 of [[Heraclitus]]: ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι τοῖς ἐγρηγορόσιν ἕνα καὶ κοινὸν κόσμον εἶναι τῶν δὲ κοιμωμένων ἕκαστον εἰς ἴδιον ἀποστρέφεσθαι  ("Heraclitus said that the waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.")

The idea of ''idios kosmos'' is an important part of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s views on [[schizophrenia]], as expressed in his 1964 essay "Schizophrenia &amp; 'The Book of Changes'", drawing on personal experience with the [[I Ching]].

{{rquote|right|The fundamental error of modern times lies in the fact that the '''yawning abyss of quality in the difference between God and man''' has been removed. The result in dogmatic theology is a mockery of God ...|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]|''Journals'', November 20, 1847&lt;ref name="Journals1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |others=translated by Alexander Dru |title=Journals of Søren Kierkegaard |publisher=Oxford |date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The '''infinite qualitative distinction''' ({{lang-da|den uendelige kvalitative forskel}}; {{lang-de|unendliche qualitative Unterschied}}), sometimes translated as '''infinite qualitative difference''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Søren |last=Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |date=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept coined by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The distinction emphasizes the very different attributes of finite and temporal men and the infinite and eternal qualities of a supreme being. This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1256">The '''inherent bad faith model''' of [[information processing]] is a theory in [[political psychology]] that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;The “Inherent Bad Faith Model” Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger, Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, Political Psychology, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;  A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored.  They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness.  An example is [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="IBFMR"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''marginal factor cost''' (MFC) is the increment to total costs paid for a [[factor of production]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of the factor employed. It is expressed in [[currency]] units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as [[labour economics|labor]], per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the  number of units of labor hired, the marginal factor cost is identical to the [[wage]] rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.

Thus for any factor the MFC is the change in total amount paid for all units of that factor divided by the change in the quantity of that factor employed.

A firm that wants to optimize its profits hires each factor up to the point at which its marginal factor cost equals its [[marginal revenue product]] (MFC=MRP).

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal profit''' is the difference between the [[marginal revenue]] and the [[marginal cost]]. Under the [[Profit maximization#Marginal cost-marginal revenue method|marginal approach to profit maximization]], to maximize profits, a firm should continue to produce a good or service up to the point where marginal profit is zero.

The most simple formula of Marginal profit is: Marginal revenue - Marginal cost. The derivate of the profit f(x) is in fact MP. In other words: p(x)=R(x)-C(x).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20341">[[Daniel Dennett]]'s '''multiple drafts model of consciousness''' is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory of [[consciousness]] based upon [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which views the [[mind]] in terms of [[information processing]]. The theory is described in depth in his book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI.]]

Dennett describes the theory as ''first-person [[operationalism]]''. As he states it:
{{quote|The Multiple Drafts model makes [the procedure of] "writing it down" in memory criterial for consciousness: that is ''what it is'' for the "given" to be "taken" ... There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis of multiple drafts==
Dennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of [[René Descartes]]. To show why, he starts with a description of the [[color phi phenomenon|phi illusion]]. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour ''before'' the second light is observed.

Dennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either ''Orwellian'' or ''Stalinesque'' hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trial]]s, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.
{{quote|[W]e can suppose, both theorists have ''exactly'' the same theory of what happens in your brain; they agree about just where and when in the brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways; they just disagree about whether that location is to be deemed pre-experiential or post-experiential. ... [T]hey even agree about how it ought to "feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the difference between misbegotten experiences and immediately misremembered experiences. [p. 125, original emphasis.]}}

Dennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the "[[Cartesian theatre]]". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, "[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121095257/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2005|title=Multiple Drafts...|date=21 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Cartesian materialism]] is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because ''what happens there'' is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized. [p. 107, original emphasis.]}}

With no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, "the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!"

According to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.

Like a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.

Different parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are "edited" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.

The conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the [[intentional stance]], akin to a body of mass having a "centre of gravity". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the "centre of narrative gravity", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through [[heterophenomenology]].

The origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of ''access consciousness'' alone, denying the independent existence of what [[Ned Block]] has labeled ''phenomenal consciousness''.&lt;ref name="block1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, N. |title=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |pages=227–287 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: 
{{quote|The [[infallibilist]] line on [[qualia]] treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. We can then treat such judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into existence by the same sort of license as novelists have to determine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We do not ask how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown.&lt;ref name="dennett2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel C. |title=Quining Qualia |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a [[quale]]). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.
{{quote|So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors—private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority—not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing—but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re-identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all.&lt;ref name="dennett2"/&gt;}}

The key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.

==Critical responses==
Some of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, "there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying" (Korb 1993).

Bogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be ''two'' Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed.&lt;ref name="bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogen, J.E. |title=Descartes' fundamental mistake: Introspective singularity |year=1992 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |issue=15 |pages=184–247 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00033914 |volume=17}} Commentary on Daniel C. Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne (1992) ''Time and the observer: The where and when of consciousness in the brain.''&lt;/ref&gt; Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bringsjord, S. |url=http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/bringsjord96explaining.html |title=Explaining Phi Without Dennett's Exotica: Good Ol' Computation Suffices |&lt;!-- accessdate=1996 --&gt;}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Straw man"===
Much of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even parody the title of the book as "Consciousness Explained Away", accusing him of [[greedy reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3005001 BBC.co.uk] – Some Modern Theories of Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:
{{quote|The now standard response to Dennett's project is that he has picked a fight with a [[straw man]]. Cartesian materialism, it is alleged, is an impossibly naive account of phenomenal consciousness held by no one currently working in cognitive science or the philosophy of mind. Consequently, whatever the effectiveness of Dennett's demolition job, it is fundamentally misdirected (see, e.g., Block, 1993, 1995; Shoemaker, 1993; and Tye, 1993).&lt;ref name="bando"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Brien, G.  |author2=Opie, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A defense of Cartesian Materialism |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=59 |pages= 939–63 |doi=10.2307/2653563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unoriginality===
Multiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.

Even the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [Hankins] Others see [[Derrida]]'s (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;{{cite book |author=Derrida, J. |title=Margins of Philosophy |publisher=The University of Chicago Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as [[eliminativism|eliminativist]], since it denies the existence of [[qualia]] and the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.

===Information processing and consciousness===
The role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by [[John Searle]] who, in his [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref name="searle"&gt;Searle, J. (1980) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104618/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html Minds, Brains and Programs]"&lt;/ref&gt; states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" (p.&amp;nbsp;439).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Negative free bid''' is a [[contract bridge]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#treatment|treatment]] whereby a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#freebid|free bid]] by responder over an opponent's overcall shows a long suit in a weak hand and is not forcing. This is in contrast with standard treatment, where a free bid can show unlimited values and is unconditionally forcing. The treatment is a relatively recent invention, and has become quite popular, especially in expert circles.

Negative free bids resolve relatively frequent situations where the responder holds a long suit with which he would like to compete for a partscore, but is deprived from bidding it by opponent's overcall.

==Example==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|||1{{diams}}||1{{spades}}||?
|} 
For example, if South holds:&amp;nbsp;{{BridgeHandInline|86|KJ10852|K6|532}}, partner opens 1{{Diams}} and East overcalls 1{{Spades}}, he couldn't bid 2{{Hearts}} in standard methods, as it would show 10+ [[Hand evaluation|high-card points]], and a [[negative double]] would be too off-shape. With NFB treatment in effect though, he can bid 2{{Hearts}} which the partner may pass (unless he has extra values and support, or an excellent suit of its own without tolerance for hearts).
{{clear}}
However, as a [[corollary]], negative free bids affect the scope of negative double; if the hand is suitable for "standard" forcing free bid (10-11+ points), a negative double has to be made first and the suit bid only in the next round. Thus, the negative double can be made with the following types of hand:
*A weakish hand with unbid suits (unbid major)
*A stronger hand with unbid suits
*A strong (opening bid or more) one-suited hand.
This can sometimes allow the opponents to [[preempt]] effectively. 
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|1{{Diams}}||1{{Hearts}}||Dbl||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=center
|?|| || ||
|} 
For example, West, holding: {{BridgeHandInline|KJ103|J8|AKQ104|J2}}, after this auction is in an awkward situation — he doesn't know whether partner has spades or not; whether South was bidding to make or to [[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]] — is it correct to double, bid 4{{Spades}} or pass?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

==Sampling of positive and negative frequencies and aliasing==
{{Main article|Aliasing#Complex sinusoids}}
[[File:Aliasing between a positive and a negative frequency.png|frame|left|This figure depicts two complex sinusoids, colored gold and cyan, that fit the same sets of real and imaginary sample points.  They are thus aliases of each other when sampled at the rate (''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') indicated by the grid lines.  The gold-colored function depicts a positive frequency, because its real part (the cos function) leads its imaginary part by 1/4 of one cycle.  The cyan function depicts a negative frequency, because its real part lags the imaginary part.]]

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]

The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.

So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

In an electronic device, the differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the static resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\,&lt;/math&gt;, or both, can be negative,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; so there are three categories of devices ''(fig. 2–4 above, and table)'' which could be called "negative resistances".

The term "negative resistance" almost always means negative ''differential'' resistance {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.}}&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Negative differential resistance devices have unique capabilities: they can act as ''one-port amplifiers'',&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shahinpoor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Razavi" /&gt; increasing the power of a time-varying signal applied to their port (terminals), or excite oscillations in a [[tuned circuit]] to make an oscillator.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Razavi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; They can also have [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneking" /&gt; It is not possible for a device to have negative differential resistance without a power source,&lt;ref name="Reich"&gt;{{cite book

*&lt;u&gt;Passive negative differential resistance devices&lt;/u&gt; (fig. 2 above): These are the most well-known type of "negative resistances"; passive two-terminal components whose intrinsic ''I–V'' curve has a downward "kink", causing the current to decrease with increasing voltage over a limited range.&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; The ''I–V'' curve, including the negative resistance region, lies in the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the plane&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; so the device has positive static resistance.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; Examples are [[gas-discharge tube]]s, [[tunnel diode]]s, and [[Gunn diode]]s.&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt; These devices have no internal power source and in general work by converting external DC power from their port to time varying (AC) power,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; so they require a DC bias current applied to the port in addition to the signal.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; To add to the confusion, some authors&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; call these "active" devices, since they can amplify.

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel diode ''TD'' has voltage controlled negative differential resistance.&lt;ref name="Fogiel" /&gt; The battery &lt;math&gt;V_b&lt;/math&gt; adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; over its linear range (such amplifiers can also have more complicated negative resistance ''I–V'' curves that do not pass through the origin).

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],
*the amount of negative resistance can be varied by adjusting the [[loop gain]],
*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

Negative [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]]s ''(below)'' can also be created, so feedback circuits can be used to create "active" linear circuit elements, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, with negative values.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; They are widely used in [[active filter]]s&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; because they can create [[transfer function]]s that cannot be realized with positive circuit elements.&lt;ref name="Podell"&gt;{{cite conference

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

A common example of an "active resistance" circuit is the [[negative impedance converter]] (NIC)&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linvill"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A resonator such as an LC circuit is "almost" an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are [[damping|damped]] and decay to zero.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator's [[resonant frequency]].&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt;

Negative resistance oscillators are mainly used at high [[frequency|frequencies]] in the [[microwave]] range or above, since [[electronic oscillator|feedback oscillators]] function poorly at these frequencies.&lt;ref name="Golio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; Microwave diodes are used in low- to medium-power oscillators for applications such as [[radar speed gun]]s, and [[local oscillator]]s for [[satellite receiver]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

[[File:Negative resistance oscillator load lines.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Gunn diode oscillator [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name="Kung2" /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

===Conditions for oscillation===

For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;math&gt;R_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative resistance of the diode '''''−r'''''. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so &lt;math&gt;X_1\;=\;-X_N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; then the gain is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===

   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">An '''object of the mind''' is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that [[Existence|exists]] in the imagination, but which, in the real world, can only be represented or modeled. Some such objects are [[abstraction]]s, [[literary]] [[concept]]s, or [[fictional]] [[scenario]]s.

Closely related are '''intentional objects''', which are what thoughts and feelings are [[intentionality|about]], even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts 
about [[unicorn]]s, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/cranetim/iWeb/Tim's%20website/Online%20papers_files/Intentional%20objects-1.pdf Tim Crane - ''Intentional Objects'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment).

==Mathematical objects==
Mathematics and geometry describe [[abstract object]]s that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of the [[mind]]. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.

Many more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the [[Klein bottle]]&lt;ref&gt;The Teaching Company, Course No. 1423. "Joy of Thinking: The Beauty and Power of Classical Mathematical Ideas." Lecture 14 - "A One-Sided, Sealed Surface - the Klein Bottle." Professors Edward B. Burger, Michael Starbird.&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the [[Möbius strip]]). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.

==Logical sequences==
If-then arguments posit [[logical]] [[sequences]] that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] argument proposes a [[hypothetical]] or [[subjunctive]] [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] which ''could'' or ''would'' be true, but ''might not'' be false. [[Conditional probability|Conditional]] sequences involving subjunctives use [[intensional logic|intensional]] language, which is studied by [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/M/m064320.htm ''Modal Logic''. Springer Online Reference Works.]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[classical logic]] studies the [[extensional]] language of [[logical possibility|necessary]] and [[sufficient]] conditions.

In general, a logical [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is a sufficient condition, and a logical [[consequent]] is a necessary condition(or the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]) in a [[logical conditional]]. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as [[material conditional]]s. In contrast, [[indicative conditional]]s, sometimes known as non-material conditionals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facweb.bcc.ctc.edu/wpayne/non-material%20conditional.htm Payne, W. Russ ''The non-material conditional'']&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.

[[Truth tables]] for if-then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. [[Strict conditional]]s assign a positive [[truth-value]] to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.

===False antecedent===
A false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.

The subjects of [[literature]] are sometimes false antecedents. For example, the contents of [[false documents]], the origins of [[wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]] phenomena, or the implications of [[loaded words]]. Also, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as "[[nothing]]", or "[[nonexistent]]", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.

[[Art]] and [[acting]] often portray scenarios without any antecedent except an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods, and goddesses.

===False consequent===
A false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]], which literally means ''out of sequence''. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.

As an example, the name of a [[team]], a [[genre]], or a [[nation]] is a collective term applied [[ex post facto]] to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by [[consensus]] or [[reference]], but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different [[social]] or [[political]] [[meaning (semiotics)|significance]].

==Philosophy of mind==

{{main|Mind-body dualism}}

In philosophy, [[mind-body dualism]] is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by [[René Descartes]] in ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

==Invented sources==
{{main|False document}}
Many objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is based on an imaginary book. In the ''Appendices'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien's characters name the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'' as the source material for ''The Lord of the Rings'', which they describe as a translation. But the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' is a fictional document that chronicles events in an [[imaginary world]]. One might imagine a different [[translation]], by another author.

==Convenient fictions==
{{see|Fictionalism}}
[[Social reality]] is composed of many standards and [[inventions]] that facilitate [[communication]], but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, [[money]] is an object of the mind which [[currency]] represents. Similarly, [[language]]s signify [[idea]]s and [[thoughts]].

Objects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, [[acting]] is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. [[Charades]] is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts.

Imaginary [[personalities]] and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the [[verisimilitude]] of [[fictional universes]], and/or the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] of [[role-playing games]]. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames.

[[Science fiction]] is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed.

[[Calendar date]]s also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, "It is the year 2005." In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, ''The Transformers: The Movie'' is [[retro-futuristic]]. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change.

Deliberate [[invention]] also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of [[deception]] is usually referred to as [[lie|lying]], in contrast to invention for [[entertainment]] or [[art]]. Invention is also often applied to [[problem solving]]. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the [[mind|mental]] invention of fictions.

Convenient fictions also occur in science.

==Science==
The theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere '''objects of the mind''' by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include [[phlogiston]] and [[ptolemaic epicycle]]s.

This raises questions, in the debate between [[scientific realism]] and [[instrumentalism]] about the status of current posits, such as [[black hole]]s and [[quark]]s. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct?

The situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose—convenient fictions. Examples include [[field line|field lines]], [[centers of gravity]], and [[electron hole]]s in semiconductor theory.

==Self-reference==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}
A [[reference]] that names an imaginary [[source text|source]] is in some sense also a [[self-reference]]. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference.

In their respective [[imaginary world]]s the ''Necronomicon'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', and the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to [[roleplaying|pretend]] or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.

==Nonexistent objects==
Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]] (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects.  Starting with the “principle of intentionality”,  mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object.  People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist.  Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Nonexistent Objects, First published Tue Aug 22, 2006; substantive revision Thu Sep 7, 2006, Accessed May 18, 2010 [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/#HisRooAleMeiProInt]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

The '''principle of explosion''' (Latin: ''ex falso (sequitur) quodlibet'' (EFQ), "from falsehood, anything (follows)", or ''ex contradictione (sequitur) quodlibet'' (ECQ), "from contradiction, anything (follows)"), or the '''principle of [[Pseudo-Scotus]]''', is the law of [[classical logic]], [[intuitionistic logic]] and similar logical systems, according to which any statement can be proven from a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Carnielli, W. and Marcos, J. (2001) [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.107.70 "Ex contradictione non sequitur quodlibet"] ''Proc. 2nd Conf. on Reasoning and Logic'' (Bucharest, July 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, once a contradiction has been asserted, any proposition (including their negations) can be inferred from it. This is known as '''deductive explosion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|at=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The proof of this principle was first given by 12th century French philosopher [[William of Soissons]].&lt;ref&gt; Graham Priest, 'What's so bad about contradictions?' in Priest, Beal and Armour-Garb, ''The law of non-contradicton'', p. 25, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

As a demonstration of the principle, consider two contradictory statements – "All lemons are yellow" and "Not all lemons are yellow", and suppose (for the sake of argument) that both are simultaneously true.  If that is the case, anything can be proven, e.g. "unicorns exist", by using the following argument:
# We know that "All lemons are yellow" as it is defined to be true.
# Therefore, the statement that ("All lemons are yellow" OR "unicorns exist”) must also be true, since the first part is true.
# However, if "Not all lemons are yellow" (and this is also defined to be true), unicorns must exist – otherwise statement 2 would be false (in rigor, given that at least one lemon exists).  It has thus been "proven" that unicorns exist. The same could be applied to any assertion, including the statement "unicorns do not exist".

Due to the principle of explosion, the existence of a contradiction ([[inconsistency]]) in a [[formal system|formal axiomatic system]] is disastrous; since any statement can be proved true it trivializes the concepts of truth and falsity.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens"&gt;{{cite web

Mathematicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Ernst Zermelo]], [[Abraham Fraenkel]], and [[Thoralf Skolem]] put much effort into revising [[set theory]] to eliminate these contradictions, resulting in the modern [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]].    

In a different solution to these problems, a few mathematicians have devised alternate theories of [[logic (mathematics)|logic]] called [[paraconsistent logic]]s, which eliminate the principle of explosion.&lt;ref name="McKubre-Jordens" /&gt;  These allow some contradictory statements to be proved without affecting other proofs.

==Symbolic representation==
In [[symbolic logic]], the principle of explosion can be expressed in the following way
:&lt;math&gt;\forall P \forall Q: (P \land \lnot P) \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;
(For any statements ''P'' and ''Q'', if ''P'' and not-''P'' are both true, then ''Q'' is true)

==Proof==
Below is a formal proof of the principle using [[symbolic logic]]
#&lt;math&gt;P \wedge \neg P&lt;/math&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;P \vee Q&lt;/math&gt;

#:from (3) and (4) by [[disjunctive syllogism]]
#&lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \neg P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;
#:from (5) by [[conditional proof]] (discharging assumption 1)

This is just the symbolic version of the informal argument given in the introduction, with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; standing for "all lemons are yellow" and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; standing for "Unicorns exist". From "all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow" (1), we infer "all lemons are yellow" (2) and "not all lemons are yellow" (3); from "all lemons are yellow" (2), we infer "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4); and from "not all lemons are yellow" (3) and "all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist" (4), we infer "unicorns exist" (5). Hence, if all lemons are yellow and not all lemons are yellow, then unicorns exist.

===Semantic argument===
An alternate argument for the principle stems from [[model theory]].  A sentence &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[semantic consequence]]'' of a set of sentences &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; only if every model of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  But there is no model of the contradictory set &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.  [[A fortiori]], there is no model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; that is not a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, vacuously, every model of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt; is a model of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.   Thus &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a semantic consequence of &lt;math&gt;(P \wedge \lnot P)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Paraconsistent logic==

[[Paraconsistent logic]]s have been developed that allow for sub-contrary forming operators.   [[Formal semantics (logic)|Model-theoretic]] paraconsistent logicians often deny the assumption that there can be no model of &lt;math&gt;\{\phi , \lnot \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; and devise semantical systems in which there are such models. Alternatively, they reject the idea that propositions can be classified as true or false.  [[Proof-theoretic semantics|Proof-theoretic]] paraconsistent logics usually deny the validity of one of the steps necessary for deriving an explosion, typically including disjunctive syllogism, disjunction introduction, and [[reductio ad absurdum]].

==Use==
The [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] value of the principle of explosion is that for any logical system where this principle holds, any derived [[mathematical theory|theory]] which proves [[false (logic)|⊥]] (or an equivalent form, &lt;math&gt;\phi \land \lnot \phi&lt;/math&gt;) is worthless because ''all'' its [[statement (logic)|statements]] would become [[theorem]]s, making it impossible to distinguish [[truth]] from falsehood. That is to say, the principle of explosion is an argument for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in classical logic, because without it all truth statements become meaningless.

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's ''Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik'', ''Archiv fur systematische Philosophie'' 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">In the [[security engineering]] subspecialty of [[computer science]], a '''trusted system''' is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce).

The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, [[malware|malicious]] or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

==Trusted systems in classified information==

A subset of trusted systems ("Division B" and "Division A") implement [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing [[classified information]]. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's "Yellow Book" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]-style "trusted systems" is the notion of a "[[reference monitor]]", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper-proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s 1983 [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC), or "Orange Book", a set of "evaluation classes" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not ''size'', as often cited) of the [[trusted computing base]] (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy.

An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of "correctness" with that of "trustworthiness".

In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes&amp;mdash;the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards&amp;mdash;the more recently introduced [[Common Criteria]] (CC)&amp;mdash;which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various [[NATO]] countries&amp;mdash;provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven "evaluation classes" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the "target of evaluation" (TOE) and support&amp;mdash;even encourage&amp;mdash;an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined "protection profiles." While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a "chain of evidence" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of [[classified information]] derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the [[Bell-LaPadula model]], in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of '''objects''' (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and '''subjects''' (active entities&amp;mdash;perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users&amp;mdash;that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a "history" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows.

At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with "lattice-based information flows" in computer systems. (A mathematical "lattice" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either "dominates," "is dominated by," or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of "labels"&amp;mdash;corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, ''e.g.'', TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO&amp;mdash;that are attached to entities.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report&amp;mdash;entitled, ''Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation''&amp;mdash;whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the "simple security property" (a subject can only read from an object that it ''dominates'' [''is greater than'' is a close enough&amp;mdash;albeit mathematically imprecise&amp;mdash;interpretation]) and the "confinement property," or "*-property" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as "no-read-up" and "no-write-down," respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow "downhill" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the  no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], one of the most general classes of attack (''sciz.'', the popularly reported [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[viruses]] are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces "confidentiality," or "secrecy," controls, ''i.e.'', they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of "integrity"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects)  and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, [[Biba_Model|K. J. Biba]]. Other integrity models include the [[Clark-Wilson model]] and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, "The SeaView Model"&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa &amp; Denning, Dorothy &amp; R. Schell, Roger &amp; Heckman, Mark &amp; R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model (Source)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed [[discretionary access control]]s(DACs), '''are''' under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as [[File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation|permission bits]] (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and&amp;mdash;in a more flexible and powerful form&amp;mdash;by Multics since earlier still) and [[access control list|access control lists (ACLs)]] are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model&amp;mdash;which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints&amp;mdash;that takes the form of a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) with state criteria, state [[transition constraint]]s, a set of "operations" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a [[Multiple_single-level#Cross-domain_solutions|descriptive top-level specification]] (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible [[interface (computing)|interface]] (''e.g.'', an [[API]], a set of [[system call]]s [in [[UNIX]] parlance] or [[Exit_(system_call)|system exit]]s [in [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==

The [[Trusted Computing Group]] creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==

Trusted systems in the context of [[national security|national]] or [[homeland security]], [[code enforcement|law enforcement]], or [[social control]] policy are systems in which some conditional [[prediction]] about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.89 The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence], Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trusted systems include the use of "security envelopes" in national security and counterterrorism applications, "[[trusted computing]]" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of [[credit score|credit or identity scoring]] systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or [[Probabilistic risk assessment|risk analysis]] is used to assess "trust" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems [[Integrity constraints|constraints]] to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which [[deviation analysis (computing)|deviation analysis]] or systems [[surveillance]] is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of [[criminal justice]] based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur – see [[Cesare Beccaria]], On Crimes and Punishment (1764) – to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative [[surveillance]] and control through system constraints – see [[Michel Foucault]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975, [[Alan Sheridan]], tr., 1977, 1995).

In this emergent model, "security" is geared not towards [[policing]] but to [[risk management]] through [[surveillance]], exchange of information, [[auditing]], communication, and [[Categorization|classification]].  These developments have led to general concerns about individual [[privacy]] and [[civil liberty]] and to a broader [[philosophical]] debate about the appropriate forms of [[social control|social governance]] methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==

Trusted systems in the context of [[information theory]] is based on the definition of trust as ''''Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel'''' by Ed Gerck.&lt;ref name="Trust Points"&gt;Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) ''Trust Points'', in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}; [http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Information Theory]], information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.  Trust is not taken  in the purely subjective sense either,  nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system  to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance"&gt;[http://nma.com/papers/it-trust-part1.pdf Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I], The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, {{ISSN|1071-6327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together in the model of Information Theory, '''information is what you do not expect''' and '''trust is what you know'''. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as  '''qualified reliance on received information'''. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, John D. (1997). [http://pages.ca.inter.net/~euclid1/call.html John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication?]&lt;/ref&gt; The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, L. (1998). [http://www.borea.nu/index.asp?PAGE=1&amp;ARTICLE=1&amp;saID=78 Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction?] Umeå: Boréa. {{ISBN|91-89140-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leads to conceptions of information where the "quality" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]]  (1972). [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/diss-avh.html Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems].The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance" /&gt;

The [[IBM]] Federal Software Group &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher"&gt;Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's [http://issaa.org/documents/ ISSAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726192910/http://issaa.org/documents/ |date=2011-07-26 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that &lt;ref name="Trust Points" /&gt; provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher" /&gt; to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]
 By Jayant V. Deshpande, {{ISBN|1-84265-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
