The '''Bernard Price Memorial Lecture''' is the premier annual lecture of the [[South African Institute of Electrical Engineers]]. It is of general scientific or engineering interest and is given by an invited guest, often from overseas, at several of the major centres on [[South Africa]]. The main lecture and accompanying dinner are usually held at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] and it is also presented in the space of one week at other centres, typically Cape Town, Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth.

The Lecture is named in memory of the eminent electrical engineer [[Bernard Price]]. The first Lecture was held in 1951 and it has occurred as an annual event ever since.

'''Borderless selling''' is the process of [[selling]] services to clients outside the country of origin of services through modern methods which eliminate the actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]]. International trade through "borderless selling" is a new phenomenon born in the current "[[globalization]]" era.

==Definitions==
'''Borderless selling''' is defined as the process of performing [[sales]] transaction between two or more parties from different countries (an [[exporter]] and an [[importer]]) which is free from actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]], such as [[tariff barrier]]s, [[currency restriction]]s, and [[import quota]]s.

==Background==
[[International trade]] which is the exchange of goods and services across international borders has been present throughout much of history of [[economics]], [[society]] and [[politics]]. 

It is assumed that [[offshore outsourcing]] gave birth to "borderless selling". The selling of services by [[offshore outsourcing]] service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas. This is largely because most of the services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.

There is a high correlation between outsourcing and exporting activity. However, borderless selling is different from free international trade or selling. Under the belief in [[Mercantilism]], most nations had high tariffs and many restrictions on international trade for centuries. In the 19th century, a belief in free trade became paramount in west, especially in Britain and this outlook has since then dominated the thinking of [[western nations]]. Traditionally international trade was possible between only those countries which regulated international trade through [[bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]]. Borderless selling is possible between any two countries of the world because services can be exported using modern telecommunication networks without the need to regulate trade.

The "borderless selling" term was originated as part of the research carried out by team led by Paramjeev Singh Sethi.

'''''Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge''''' is a 1998 book by biologist [[E. O. Wilson]], in which the author discusses methods that have been used to unite the sciences and might in the future unite them with the humanities. Wilson uses the term ''[[consilience]]'' to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor.

==Definition of ''consilience''==
"Literally a 'jumping together' of knowledge by the linking of facts and fact-based theory across disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation." (page 7)

==Examples of consilience discussed by Wilson==

===Chapter 1===
* '''The "New Synthesis"'''. Unification of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution with [[genetics]]. 
* '''[[Gerald Holton]]'s "Ionian Enchantment"'''. The conviction that the world has a unified order and can be explained by [[physical law|natural laws]].
* '''Theory that water is fundamental'''. [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] proposed that water is the unifying basis for all material things. Often cited as the first materialistic theory of a unified view of nature.
* '''[[Fundamental force#Theory of everything|Unification of forces]]''' in modern physics.
* '''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s work'''. For example, unification of [[Brownian motion]] with [[atomic theory]].
* '''Unity of purpose for science and religion'''. To explain the universe and understand our role in the universe.

===Chapter 2===
* '''[[Environmentalism|Environmental protection]]'''. The need to link together knowledge from [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|government regulators]], [[ethics]], [[social science]], [[biology]], and physical sciences like [[chemistry]].
* '''Unity of purpose for [[philosophy]] and science'''. Philosophers and scientists can work together at the borders between biology, social science and the humanities.
* '''[[Liberal arts college|Liberal arts education]]'''. Recognition of the unity of knowledge as a way to revitalize [[Higher education|education]].
* '''[[Public policy (law)|Government policy]]'''. The need to assemble unified knowledge from across specialized disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.

===Chapter 3===
* '''[[The Enlightenment]]'''. In the context of scientific knowledge applied to human rights and social progress.
*'''[[Marquis de Condorcet]]'''. Condorcet's systematic application of [[mathematics]] in the [[social sciences]].
* '''[[Francis Bacon]]'''.  Early advocate of data collection and its analysis as the basis of sound knowledge ([[Baconian method]]) in fields that include social science and the humanities.
* '''[[René Descartes]]'''. Believed that the universe is rational and united and that interconnected truths run from physics to biology to [[Ethics|moral]] reasoning. Descartes unified [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] (see: [[Cartesian coordinate system]]).
*'''[[Isaac Newton]]'''. Unified the [[Galileo Galilei|laws of falling bodies]] with the laws of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|planetary motion]] (see: [[law of universal gravitation]]).
* '''Origin of social science'''. The roles of [[Adolphe Quetelet]] and [[Auguste Comte]] in developing the idea of studying behavior with scientific methods.
* '''Unity of purpose for [[Postmodernism]] and Science'''. Wilson argues that humanity is driven forward by the tension between those who upon viewing order create disorder and those who upon viewing disorder create order.

===Chapter 4===
* '''The [[Atomism|Greek Atomists]]'''. Greeks such as [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] are credited with the [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] idea that matter has fundamental components. Scientific investigation of this idea has resulted in unification across the natural sciences. Example: the molecular structure of [[DNA]] accounts for [[genetics|genetic]] storage in living cells.
* '''[[Experiment]]al [[Epistemology]]'''. A modern attempt to unify [[neuroscience]] and epistemology. Discussed as a method for clarifying the [[Evolution]]ary basis of mismatches between physical [[reality]] and our mental models of reality.
*'''[[Positivism]]'''. A method for comparing and unifying knowledge from different disciplines; gives priority to facts which are generated by experiment and objective observation rather than subjective speculations.
*'''[[Pragmatism]]'''. A method for comparing and unifying knowledge from different disciplines; gives priority to methods and techniques that can be demonstrated to work and have pragmatic value.

===Chapter 5===
* '''Reduction vs. synthesis'''. Many examples comparing consilience by reduction (dissect a phenomenon into its components) and consilience by synthesis (predicting higher-order phenomena from more basic physical principles). One specific example is Wilson's own work on the [[Pheromone|chemical signals]] that regulate [[Eusociality|insect social behavior]].
* '''Magician to Atom'''. An example of consilience by reduction in which Wilson tries to account for the prevalence of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent symbols]] in human cultures. Incorporates the "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12805675 activation-synthesis model]" of [[dream]]ing.
* '''Consilience between biology disciplines'''. Discussion of successes ([[cell (biology)|cell]]s explained in terms of their [[chemical]] components, [[Developmental biology|embryo]] development in terms of interactions between the cells of an embryo) but also points to the remaining problem of dealing with [[complex systems]] as in [[neuroscience]] and [[ecology]].
* '''[[Statistical mechanics]]'''. A classical example in which the behavior of volumes of gas is explained in terms of the molecules of the gas ([[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]).
* '''[[Quantum chemistry]]'''. Prediction of chemical properties by quantum mechanical calculations.

===Chapter 6===
* '''Explaining [[consciousness]] and [[emotion]] in terms of brain activity'''. Wilson describes the neurobiological approach to accounting for consciousness and emotion in terms of brain physiology and how this effort is guided by collaboration between biologists, psychologists and philosophers. 
* '''Neurobiology of [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics in art|aesthetics]]'''. Wilson proposes that it will be possible to construct a neurobiological understanding of subjective experiences that are shared and explored by [[art]]. Common neural patterns of activity will be found to correspond to fundamental aesthetic experiences. 
* '''Artificial [[emotion]]'''. Wilson proposes that human-like artificial intelligence will require the engineering of a computational apparatus for processing an array of rich sensory inputs and the capacity to learn from those inputs in the way that children can learn. Requires consilience between biology, psychology and computer science.

===Chapter 7===
* '''The relationship between [[gene]]s and [[culture]]'''. Wilson posits that the basic element of culture is the [[meme]]. When a meme exists in a brain it has the form of a neuronal network that allows the meme to function within semantic [[memory]]. The link from genes to culture is that our genes shape our brains (in cooperation with the environment) and our brains allow us to work with memes as the basic units of culture.

[[File:Spectrophotometer.jpg|thumb|right|DU Spectrophotometer, National Technical Laboratories, 1947]]

The '''DU spectrophotometer''' or '''Beckman DU''', introduced in 1941, was the first commercially viable [[scientific instrument]] for measuring the amount of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] absorbed by a substance. This model of [[spectrophotometer]] enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its [[absorption spectrum]], the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. [[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold O. Beckman]]'s [[National Technical Laboratories]] (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.

Sometimes referred to as a UV–Vis spectrophotometer because it measured both the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] spectra, the DU spectrophotometer is credited as being a truly revolutionary technology. It yielded more accurate results than previous methods for determining the [[chemical composition]] of a complex substance, and substantially reduced the time needed for an accurate analysis from weeks or hours to minutes. The Beckman DU was essential to several critical secret research projects during [[World War II]], including the development of [[penicillin]] and [[synthetic rubber]].

==Background==
Before the development of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process. A classical [[Wet chemistry|wet laboratory]] contained a wide variety of complicated apparatus.&lt;ref name="Dulski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=A manual for the chemical analysis of metals|date=1996|publisher=ASTM|location=West Conshohocken, PA|isbn=978-0-8031-2066-2|chapter=The Wet Lab|pages=11–14|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ViOMjoLKB1gC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test samples were run through a series of awkward and time-consuming [[Qualitative research|qualitative processes]] to separate out and identify their components. Determining [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] concentrations of those components in the sample involved further steps. Processes could involve techniques for [[chemical reactions]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitations]], [[filtration]]s and [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolutions]].&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book

Spectroscopic methods for observing the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]] were known as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter J.

Scientists had observed that light traveling through a [[Optical medium|medium]] would be absorbed at different wavelengths, depending on the matter-composition of the medium involved. A white light source would emit light at multiple wavelengths over a range of frequencies. A prism could be used to separate a light source into specific wavelengths. Shining the light through a sample of a material would cause some wavelengths of light to be absorbed, while others would be unaffected and continue to be transmitted. Wavelengths in the resulting [[absorption spectrum]] would differ depending upon the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition if the material involved.&lt;ref name="MMSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiment 10|url=http://www.pa.msu.edu/courses/2013spring/PHY252/Lab10.pdf|website=MMSU Physics and Astronomy Department|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Daniel C.|last2=Bertolucci|first2=Michael D.|title=Symmetry and spectroscopy : an introduction to vibrational and electronic spectroscopy|date=1989|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-66144-5|edition=Reprint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3W6oSaRlMsC&amp;pg=PA66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hollas|first1=J.

Spectroscopic methods were predominantly used by [[physicists]] and [[astrophysicists]]. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently made up of physicists rather than chemists.
&lt;ref name="Bigg"/&gt;{{rp|113–118}} By the 1930s he had developed a [[niche market]] in [[metallurgy]], where his instruments were well adapted to the types of problems that chemists were solving.&lt;ref name="Bigg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigg|first1=Charlotte|chapter=Adam Hilger, Ltd and the Development of Spectrochemical Analysis|editor-last1=Morris|editor-first1=Peter J.

By the 1940s, both academic and industrial chemists were becoming increasingly interested in problems involving the composition and detection of [[Biomolecule|biological molecules]]. Biological molecules, including [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]], absorb light energy in both the [[ultraviolet]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] range.&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; The spectrum of visible light was not broad enough to enable scientists to examine substances such as [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt; Accurate characterization of complex samples, particularly of biological materials, would require the accurate reading of absorption frequencies in the ultraviolet and [[infrared]] (IR) sections of the spectrum in addition to visible light. Existing instruments such as the [[Central Scientific Company|Cenco]] "Spectrophotelometer" and the Coleman Model DM Spectrophotometer could not be effectively used to examine wavelengths in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

The array of equipment needed to measure light energy reaching beyond the visible spectrum towards the ultraviolet could cost a laboratory as much as $3,000, a huge amount in 1940.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|149}} Repeated readings of a sample were taken to produce [[photographic plates]] showing the absorption spectrum of a material at different wavelengths. An experienced human could compare these to the known images to identify a match. Then information from the plates had to be combined to create a graph showing the spectrum as a whole. Ultimately, the accuracy of such approaches was dependent on accurate, consistent development of the photographic plates, and on human [[visual acuity]] and practice in reading the wavelengths.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}

==Development==
The DU was developed at National Technical Laboratories (later [[Beckman Instruments]]) under the direction of [[Arnold Orville Beckman]], an American chemist and inventor.&lt;ref name="Gallwas"&gt;{{cite journal

Coleman Instruments had recently coupled a [[pH meter]] with an optical [[phototube]] unit to examine the visual spectrum (the Coleman Model DM).&lt;ref name=Smutzer/&gt; Beckman had already developed a successful pH meter for measuring acidity of solutions, his company's breakthrough product. Seeing the potential to build upon their existing expertise, Beckman made it a goal to create an easy-to-use integrated instrument which would both register and report specific wavelengths extending into the ultraviolet range. Rather than depending on development of photographic plates, or a human observer's visual ability to detect wavelengths in the absorption spectrum, phototubes would be used to register and report the specific wavelengths that were detected. This had the potential to increase the instrument's accuracy and reliability as well as its speed and ease of use.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|149–151}}

=== Model A (prototype) ===
The first prototype Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, was created at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. It used a [[tungsten]] light source with a glass [[Fery prism]] as a [[monochromator]].&lt;ref name="Belser"&gt;{{cite web

Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile [[headlamps]].&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a [[vacuum tube]] photocell were used to detect wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

===Model B (prototype) ===
[[File:Quartz-tcq01a.jpg|thumb|right|Optical quality quartz crystals]]
It was quickly realized that a glass [[dispersive prism]] was not suitable for use in the ultraviolet spectrum.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 [[Nanometre|millimicrons]] rather than dispersing it.&lt;ref name="Bisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bisen|first1=Prakash S.|last2=Sharma|first2=Anjana|title=Introduction to instrumentation in life sciences|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-1240-5|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1HOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Model B, a [[quartz]] prism was substituted for the earlier glass.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

A tangent bar mechanism was used to adjust the monochromator. The mechanism was highly sensitive and required a skilled operator.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Only two Model B prototypes were made. One was sold: in February 1941, to the [[University of California]] Chemistry department in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

The Model B prototype should be distinguished from a later production model of spectrophotometer that was also referred to as the Model "B". The production Model "B" was introduced in 1949 as a less-expensive, simple-to-use alternative to the Beckman DU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheSpectrophotometers That Would Not Die|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/599/2/Spectrophotometers.pdf|website=Caltech|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a glass Fery prism as a chromator and operated in a narrower range, roughly from 320 millimicrons to 950 millimicrons, and 5 to 20 [[Angstrom|Å]].&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=J.|editor-last1=Paech|editor-first1=K.|editor-last2=Tracey|editor-first2=M.

===Model C (prototype) ===
Three Model C instruments were then built, improving the instrument's wavelength resolution. The Model B's rotary cell compartment was replaced with a linear sample chamber. The tangent bar mechanism was replaced by a scroll drive mechanism,&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} which could be more precisely controlled to reset the quartz prism and select the desired wavelength.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt; With this new mechanism, results could be more easily and reliably obtained, without requiring a highly skilled operator. This set the pattern for all of Beckman's later quartz prism instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Although only three Model B prototypes were built, all were sold, one to [[Caltech]] and the other two to companies in the food industry.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153}}

===Model D (limited production) ===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 6 Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 001 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

The A, B, and C prototype models all coupled an external Beckman pH meter to the optical component to obtain readouts. In developing the Model D, Beckman took the [[direct-coupled amplifier]] circuit from the pH meter and combined the optical and electronic components in a single housing, making it more economical.&lt;ref name="Smutzer"/&gt;

Moving from a prototype to production of the Model D involved challenges. 
Beckman originally approached [[Bausch and Lomb]] about making quartz prisms for the spectrophotometer. When they turned down the opportunity, National Technical Laboratories designed its own optical system, including both a control mechanism and a quartz prism. Large, high optical quality quartz suitable for creating prisms was difficult to obtain. It came from Brazil, and was in demand for wartime [[Crystal oscillator|radio oscillators]]. Beckman had to obtain a wartime priority listing for the spectrophotometer to get access to suitable quartz supplies.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Beckman had previously attempted to find a source of reliable [[Deuterium arc lamp|hydrogen lamps]], seeking better sensitivity to wavelengths in the ultraviolet range than was possible with tungsten. As described in July 1941, the Beckman spectrophotomter could use a "hot cathode hydrogen discharge tube" or a tungsten light source interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|684–685}} However, Beckman was still unsatisfied with the available hydrogen lamps. National Technical Laboratories designed its own hydrogen lamp, an [[anode]] enclosed in a thin blown-glass window.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}} By December 1941, the in-house design was being used in production of the Model D.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

The instrument's design also required a more sensitive phototube than was commercially available at that time. Beckman was able to obtain small batches of an experimental phototube from [[RCA]] for the first Model D instruments.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The Model D spectrophotometer, using the experimental RCA phototube, was shown at [[MIT]]'s Summer Conference on Spectroscopy in July 1941. The paper that Cary and Beckman presented there was published in the ''Journal of the Optical Society of America''. In it, Cary and Beckman compared designs for a modified [[Collimated light|self-collimating]] quartz Fery prism, a mirror-collimated quartz [[Littrow prism]], and various gratings.&lt;ref name="Cary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cary|first1=H. H.|last2=Beckman|first2=Arnold O.|title=A Quartz Photoelectric Spectrophotometer|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=1941|volume=31|issue=11|pages=682–689 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.31.000682|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-31-11-682}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|683}} The Littrow prism was a half-prism, which had a mirrored face.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;{{rp|31–34}} Use of a tungsten light source with the [[quartz]] Littrow prism as a monochromator was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|686}}

The Model D was the first model to enter actual production. A small number of Model D instruments were sold, beginning in July 1941, before it was superseded by the DU.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|153–155}}&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

===Model DU===
[[File:Cary+Beckman 1941 original of Fig 7 disassembled Quartz photoelectric spectrophotometer 2012-002 b17f20 003 crop.jpg | thumb|right | Disassembled absorption cell and photo-tube compartment, Cary &amp; Beckman, 1941&lt;ref name="Cary"/&gt;{{rp|687}}]]

When RCA could not meet Beckman's demand for experimental phototubes, National Technical Laboratories again had to design its own components in-house.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} They developed a pair of phototubes, sensitive to the red and blue areas of the spectrum, capable of amplifying the signals they received.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"/&gt;{{rp|230}} With the incorporation of Beckman's UV-sensitive phototubes, the Model D became the Model DU UV–Vis spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|18}} Its designation as a "UV–Vis" spectrophotometer indicates its ability to measure light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectra.&lt;ref name=Buie/&gt;

The DU was the first commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|148}} &lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;{{rp|10}} As he had done with the pH meter, Beckman had replaced an array of complicated equipment with a single, easy-to-use instrument. One of the first fully integrated instruments&lt;ref name="Belser"/&gt;{{rp|11}} or "[[black box]]es" used in modern chemical laboratories,&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/spectral_image_5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it sold for $723 in 1941.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt;

It is generally assumed that the "DU" in the name was a combination of "D" for the Model D on which it was based, and "U" for the ultraviolet spectrum. However, it has been suggested that "DU" may also reference Beckman's fraternity at the University of Illinois, [[Delta Upsilon Fraternity House (Champaign, Illinois)|Delta Upsilon]], whose members were called "DU"s.&lt;ref name="ISL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beckman Model DU Quartz Spectrophotometer|url=http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/Arnold_inventions/Spectrophotometer/Spectrophotometer.html|website=Illinois Simulator Laboratory|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A publication in the scholarly literature compared the optical quality of the DU to the [[Cary 14 Spectrophotometer]], another leading UV–Vis spectrophotometer of the time.&lt;ref name="JOS1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brode|first1=Wallace R.|last2=Gould|first2=John H.|last3=Whitney|first3=James E.|last4=Wyman|first4=George M.|title=A Comparative Survey of Spectrophotometers in the 210–760 mμ Region|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|date=October 1953|volume=43|issue=10|pages=862–865|bibcode=1953JOSA...43..862B|doi=10.1364/JOSA.43.000862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
From 1941 until 1976, when it was discontinued, the Model DU spectrophotometer was built upon what was essentially the same design.&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt; It was a single beam instrument.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Trace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dulski|first1=Thomas R.|title=Trace elemental analysis of metals : methods and techniques|date=1999|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-1985-2|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk7lTgTMEIEC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The DU spectrophotometers used a quartz prism to separate light from a lamp into its absorption spectrum and a phototube to electrically measure the light energy across the spectrum. This allowed the user to plot the light absorption spectrum of a substance to obtain a standardized "fingerprint" characteristic of a compound.&lt;ref name="hundred" /&gt;{{rp|151}} &lt;ref name="Jarnutowski"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarnutowski|first1=R.|last2=Ferraro|first2=J.

{{quote|"Light from the tungsten lamp is focused by the condensing mirror and directed in a beam to the diagonal slit entrance mirror. The entrance mirror deflects the light through the entrance slit and into the monochromator to the collimating mirror. Light falling on the collimating mirror is rendered parallel and reflected to the quartz prism where it undergoes refraction. The back surface of the prism is aluminized so that light refracted at the first surface is reflected back through the prism, undergoing further refraction as it emerges from the prism. The desired wavelength of light is selected by rotating the Wavelength Selector which adjusts the position of the prism. The spectrum is directed back to the collimating mirror which centers the chosen wavelength on the exit slit and sample. Light passing through the sample strikes the phototube, causing a current gain. The current gain is amplified and registered on the null meter."

As advertised in the 1941 News Edition of the American Chemical Society, the Beckman Spectrophotometer used an [[Autocollimation|autocollimating]] quartz crystal prism for a monochromator, capable of covering a range from the ultraviolet (200 millimicrons) to the infrared (2000 millimicrons), with a nominal bandwidth of 2 millimicrons or less for most of its spectral range. The slit mechanism was continuously adjustable from .01 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm and claimed to have less than 1/10% of stray light over most of the spectral range. It featured an easy-to-read wavelength scale, simultaneously reporting % Transmission and Density information.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt;

The sample holder held up to 4 cells.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Advertisement"/&gt; Cells could be moved into the light path via an external control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a [[Blank (solution)|blank]], or [[Standard solution|standard]], "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent."&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} The standard could be a cell filled with a [[solvent]] such as [[distilled water]]&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|24}} or a prepared solvent of a known concentration.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=James W.|title=Atomic spectroscopy|date=1996|publisher=Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8247-9742-3|pages=30–33|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNqp0RO7DXcC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30–31}} At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, [[transmittance]], to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to [[absorbance]] which is proportional to the solute concentration according to [[Beer's law]]. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.&lt;ref name="Drees"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bishop|editor-first1=Michael L.|editor-last2=Fody|editor-first2=Edward P. | editor-first3=Larry E. |editor-last3=Schoeff|last2=Wu|first2=Alan H.

The user could also switch between phototubes without removing the sample holder. A 1941 advertisement indicates that three types of phototubes were available, with maximum sensitivity to red, blue and ultraviolet light ranges.&lt;ref name="Advertisement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Announcing an Important New Beckman Development THE BECKMAN Spectrophotometer|work=News Edition of the American Chemical Society|page=NA|agency=American Chemical Society|date=September 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1954 DU spectrophotometer differs in that it claims to be useful from 200 to 1000 millimicrons,&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and does not mention the ultraviolet phototube.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The wavelength selector, however, still ranged from 200 to 2000 millimicrons.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and an "Ultraviolet accessory set" was available.&lt;ref name="Manual1954"/&gt;{{rp|25}} This shift away from using the DU for infrared measurement is understandable, since by 1954 Beckman Instruments was marketing a separate infrared spectrophotometer. Beckman developed the IR-1 infrared spectrophotometer during World War II, and redesigned it as the IR-4 between 1953 and 1956.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

==Impact==

Credited with having "brought about a breakthrough in optical spectroscopy",&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;{{rp|10}} the Beckman DU has been identified as "an indispensable tool for chemistry"&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|207}} and "the [[Model T]] of laboratory instruments".&lt;ref name=Simoni/&gt; Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Werner|title=Optical spectroscopy in chemistry and life sciences|date=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|isbn=3-527-29911-4|chapter=Introduction to Optical Spectroscopy|pages=1–11|url=http://www.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527299114_c01.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Browne|first1=Malcolm W.|title=After Decades, Inventor's Work Is Still Felt in the Laboratory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/after-decades-inventor-s-work-is-still-felt-in-the-laboratory.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 10, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DU enabled researchers to perform easier analysis of substances by quickly taking measurements at more than one wavelength to produce an absorption spectrum describing the complete substance. For example, the standard method of analysis of the [[vitamin A]] content of [[shark liver oil]], before the introduction of the DU spectrophotometer, involved feeding the oil to rats for 21 days, then cutting off the rats' tails and examining their bone structure. With the DU's UV technology, vitamin A content of shark liver oil could be determined directly in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="Pillsbury"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Scripps Research Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology credit the DU with improving both accuracy and speed of chemical analysis. MIT states: "This device forever simplified and streamlined chemical analysis, by allowing researchers to perform a 99.9% accurate quantitative measurement of a substance within minutes, as opposed to the weeks required previously for results of only 25% accuracy."&lt;ref name="Scripps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

===Vitamins===
Development of the spectrophotometer had direct relevance to World War II and the American war effort. The role of vitamins in health was of significant concern, as scientists wanted to identify [[Vitamin A]]-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous methods of assessing Vitamin A levels involved feeding rats a food for several weeks and then performing a biopsy to estimate ingested Vitamin A levels. In contrast, examining a food sample with a DU spectrophotometer yielded better results in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name=LabNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Andrew|title=Leading the way in chemical instrumentation|journal=Laboratory News|date=September 21, 2007|url=http://www.labnews.co.uk/features/leading-the-way-in-chemical-instrumentation/|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DU spectrophotometer could be used to study both vitamin A and its precursor [[carotenoids]],&lt;ref name="Avampato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avampato|first1=J.E.|last2=Eaton|first2=H.D.|title=Comparison of Methods for the Estimation of Vitamin A in Calf Plasma|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|date=August 1953|volume=36|issue=8|pages=783–793|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(53)91563-X|url=http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(53)91563-X/abstract|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly became the preferred method of spectrophotometric analysis.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;{{cite journal

===Enzyme assays and DNA research===
[[Gerty Cori]] and her husband [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1947 in recognition of their work on [[enzymes]]. They made several discoveries critical to understanding [[carbohydrate metabolism]], including the isolation and discovery of the [[Cori ester]], [[glucose 1-phosphate]], and the understanding of the [[Cori cycle]]. They determined that the enzyme [[phosphorylase]] catalyzes formation of glucose 1-phosphate, which is the beginning and ending step in the conversions of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]] and [[blood glucose]] to glycogen. Gerty Cori was also the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease.&lt;ref name=Smeltzer&gt;{{cite book|last=Smeltzer|first=Ronald K.|title=Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement|year=2013|publisher=The Grolier Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beckman DU spectrophotometer was used in the Cori laboratory to calculate enzyme concentrations, including phosphorylase.&lt;ref name="Cori"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cori|first1=Carl F.|last2=Illingworth|first2=Barbara|title=The prosthetic group of phosphorylase|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=July 15, 1957|volume=43|issue=7|pages=547–552|pmc=528497|bibcode = 1957PNAS...43..547C |doi = 10.1073/pnas.43.7.547|pmid=16590054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another researcher who spent six months in 1947 at the Cori laboratory, "the most vibrant place in biochemistry" at that time, was [[Arthur Kornberg]].&lt;ref name="Teachers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kornberg|first1=Arthur|title=Remembering Our Teachers|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=January 5, 2001|volume=276|pages=3–11|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/276/1/3|accessdate=17 March 2016|pmid=11134064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kornberg was already familiar with the DU spectrophotometer, which he had used at [[Severo Ochoa]]'s laboratory at [[New York University]].

Kornberg and Bernard L. Horecker used the Beckman DU spectrophotometer for enzyme assays measuring [[NADH]] and [[NADPH]]. They determined their extinction coefficients, establishing a basis for quantitative measurements in reactions involving [[nucleotides]]. This work became one of the most cited papers in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="exton"/&gt;{{rp|115}} Kornberg went on to study nucleotides in DNA synthesis, isolating the first DNA polymerizing enzyme ([[DNA polymerase I]]) in 1956 and receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with Severo Ochoa in 1959.&lt;ref name="Kresge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kresge|first1=Nicole|last2=Simoni|first2=Robert D.|last3=Hill|first3=Robert L.|title=Arthur Kornberg's Discovery of DNA Polymerase I|journal=J.

He further demonstrated that the relative amounts of guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine varied between species. In 1952, Chargaff met [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D.

==Later models==
[[File:Beckman DK1 Spectrophotometer 2002.003.004b.tif|thumb|right| Beckman Model DK1 Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer]]

The Beckman team eventually developed additional models, as well as a number of accessories or attachments which could be used to modify the DU for different types of work. One of the first accessories was a flame attachment with a more powerful photo multiplier to enable the user to examine flames such as [[potassium]], [[sodium]] and [[cesium]] (1947).&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Kenneth|editor-last=Berl|editor-first=Walter G.|title=Physical Methods in Chemical Analysis|date=1956|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4832-5563-7|chapter=Flame photometry|pages=219–290|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSsXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230}}

In the 1950s, Beckman Instruments developed the DR and the DK, both of which were double-beam ultraviolet spectrophotometers. The DK was named for [[Wilbur I. Kaye]], who developed it by modifying the DU to expand its range into the near-infrared.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; He did the initial work while at Tennessee [[Eastman Kodak]], and later was hired by Beckman Instruments.&lt;ref name=Kaye&gt;{{cite book|first1= Arnold |last1=Thackray |last2= Gallwas|first2= Gerald E.|title=Wilbur I.

The DK-1 used a non-linear scroll, and the DK-2 used a linear scroll to automatically record the spectra.&lt;ref name=Kaye/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The DR incorporated a "robot operator" which would reset the knobs on the DU to complete a sequence of measurements at different wavelengths, just like a human operator would to generate results for a full spectrum. It used a linear shuttle with four positions, and a superstructure to change the knobs. It had a moving chart recorder to plot results, with red, green and black dots.&lt;ref name=Manning/&gt; The price of recording spectrophotometers was substantially higher than non-recording machines.&lt;ref name="Krige"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:To deposit or not to deposit, that is the question - journal.pbio.1001779.g001.png|thumb|The decision whether and how to share data often rests with researchers.]]
'''Data sharing''' is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Replication has a long history in science.  The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated "Take no man's word for it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ History of the Royal Society] webpage accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-stefan-elbe/a-global-health-epidemic-_b_14129608.html|title=A Global Health Epidemic Is A Ticking Time Bomb - But Virus Databases Can And Are Helping To Save Lives|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7270183|title=A shot of transparency|date=2006-08-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-06|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.

Data and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to encourage the right behaviour|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/416001b|journal=Nature|volume=416|issue=6876|pages=1–1|doi=10.1038/416001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on [[Scientific data archiving|data archiving]]. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the [[history of science]] made possible by technological advances in communications and [[information technology]]. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=John W.|date=2017-02-23|title=Viruses: Model to accelerate epidemic responses|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/542414b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=542|issue=7642|pages=414–414|doi=10.1038/542414b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ip-watch.org/2017/05/20/no-free-lunch-g20-health-ministers-find-first-meeting/|title=No Free Lunch, G20 Health Ministers Find At First Meeting|date=2017-05-20|website=Intellectual Property Watch|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savage CJ, Vickers AJ | year = 2009 | title = Empirical Study of Data Sharing by Authors Publishing in PLoS Journals | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e7078 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007078 | pmid=19763261 | pmc=2739314}}&lt;/ref&gt; When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/publication.html Publication and Openness]," chapter from "On Being A Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research", National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform.

==U.S. government policies==

===Federal law===
On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the [[America COMPETES Act]] (or the "America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.&lt;ref name = "H.R. 2272"&gt;"[http://commdocs.house.gov/reports/110/h2272.pdf America COMPETES Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH data sharing policy===
{{Quote |‘The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants Policy Statement defines "data" as "recorded information, regardless of the form or medium on which it may be recorded, and includes writings, films, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs, or other graphic representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing or computer programs (software), statistical records, and other research data."’ | Council on Governmental Relations&lt;ref&gt;"[http://206.151.87.67/docs/CompleteDRBooklet.htm Access to and retention of research data]: Rights and responsibilities", p. 5. Council on Governmental Relations, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says:
{{Quote |‘NIH reaffirms its support for the concept of data sharing. We believe that data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to serve these and other important scientific goals. The NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers.

‘NIH recognizes that the investigators who collect the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. We have therefore revised our definition of "the timely release and sharing" to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final data set. NIH continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from first and continuing use but not from prolonged exclusive use.’ | ‘[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html Final NIH statement on sharing research data].’&lt;ref name = "Grants"&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===NSF Policy from Grant General Conditions===
{{Quote |'''36. Sharing of Findings, Data, and Other Research Products'''
''a. NSF …expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work. It also encourages awardees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.''

''b. Adjustments and, where essential, exceptions may be allowed to safeguard the rights of individuals and subjects, the validity of results, or the integrity of collections or to accommodate legitimate interests of investigators.'' | "[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/gc101/gc101rev1.pdf National Science Foundation]: Grant General Conditions (GC-1)", April 1, 2001 (p. 17).}}

==Office of Research Integrity==
Allegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission:

{{Quote |"The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) promotes integrity in biomedical and behavioral research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) at about 4,000 institutions worldwide. ORI monitors institutional investigations of research misconduct and facilitates the responsible conduct of research (RCR) through educational, preventive, and regulatory activities." | [http://ori.dhhs.gov/ Office of Research Integrity].}}

==Ideals in data sharing==
Some research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's [[WaveLab (mathematics software)|WaveLab]] has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled "WaveLab and Reproducible Research," the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf WaveLab and Reproducible Research] by Jonathan B. Buckheit and [[David Donoho|David L. Donoho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is described:
:''The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab850 website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2005-09-01|title=Japonica Rice: Intellectual Property, Scientific Publishing and Data‐sharing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08109020500235180|journal=Prometheus|volume=23|issue=3|pages=325–347|doi=10.1080/08109020500235180|issn=0810-9028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Observation Network for Earth''' ([[DataONE]]) and Data Conservancy&lt;ref&gt;[https://dataconservancy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; are projects supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support [[meta-analysis]]. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reichman O.J. |author2=Jones M.B. |author3=Schildhauer M.P. | year = 2011 | title = Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology | url = | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6018| pages = 703–705 | doi = 10.1126/science.1197962 | pmid=21311007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the [[National Institute on Aging]] has stated, "the old model in which researchers jealously guarded their data is no longer applicable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/health/04alzheimer.html NY Times article about value of shared data to Alzheimers research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a group of organizations that support open access to government sponsored research. The group has expressed a "Statement of Principles" explaining why they believe open access is important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ The Alliance for Taxpayer Access website]&lt;/ref&gt; They also list a number of international public access policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/international.html Worldwide momentum for public access to publicly funded research ]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more so than in timely communication of essential information to effectively respond to health emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shu|first=Yuelong|last2=McCauley|first2=John|title=GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data – from vision to reality|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22750|journal=Eurosurveillance|volume=22|issue=13|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.es.2017.22.13.30494}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public domain archives have been embraced for depositing data, mainly post formal publication, they have failed to encourage rapid data sharing during health emergencies, among them the Ebola&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yozwiak|first=Nathan L.|last2=Schaffner|first2=Stephen F.|last3=Sabeti|first3=Pardis C.|date=2015-02-26|title=Data sharing: Make outbreak research open access|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/518477a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=518|issue=7540|pages=477–479|doi=10.1038/518477a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/zika-virus-outbreak-when-research-goes-off-the-rails/article8203618.ece|title=When research goes off the rails|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-11|title=Benefits of sharing|url=http://www.nature.com/news/benefits-of-sharing-1.19322|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=530|issue=7589|pages=129–129|doi=10.1038/530129a}}&lt;/ref&gt; outbreaks.

==Data sharing problems==

===Academic genetics===
Withholding of data has become so commonplace in academic genetics that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published a journal article on the subject. The study found that "Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.473 |vauthors=Campbell EG, Clarridge BR, Gokhale M |title=Data withholding in academic genetics: evidence from a national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=4 |pages=473–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11798369 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11798369|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic psychology===
In a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Borsboom | first2 = D. | last3 = Kats | first3 = J. | last4 = Molenaar | first4 = D. | title = The poor availability of psychological research data for reanalysis | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.726 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 726–728 | year = 2006 | pmid =  17032082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanpaemel | first1 =W. | last2 = Vermorgen | first2 = M. | last3 = Deriemaecker | first3 = L. | last4 = Storms | first4 = G. | title = Are we wasting a good crisis?

===Academic archaeology===
A 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February–May 2017 in the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications. They contacted the authors of 23 articles and received 15 replies, resulting in a 70% response rate. They received five responses that included data files, giving an overall sharing rate of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Birch|first2=Suzanne E. Pilaar|title=A Standard for the Scholarly Citation of Archaeological Data as an Incentive to Data Sharing|journal=Advances in Archaeological Practice|date=5 April 2018|volume=6|issue=02|pages=125–143|doi=10.1017/aap.2018.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists in training===
A study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001888-200602000-00007 |vauthors=Vogeli C, Yucel R, Bendavid E |title=Data withholding and the next generation of scientists: results of a national survey |journal=Acad Med |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16436573 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=128|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices.

==Differing approaches in different fields==
Requirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing.

Funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements.

Data sharing poses specific challenges in [[participatory monitoring]] initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of [[free, prior and informed consent]], and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;D Sabogal. 2015.

Global Canopy Programme. http://forestcompass.org/how/resources/data-sharing-community-based-forest-monitoring-lessons-guyana&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Discover Sensors''' project is an initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) to support the use of sensor technology in hands-on scientific investigations by Junior Certificate Science students. It is designed to provide students with an experience of "real science" in the classroom, supporting the investigative approach promoted by the revised [[Junior Certificate]] Science syllabus. DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science &amp; Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 Article in Silicon Republic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205060423/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9772 |date=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1644&amp;Itemid=1&amp;ed=136 Article in Waterford Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html Article in ENN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419061334/http://www.enn.ie/article/10123534.html |date=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project also has a website to support [[teachers]] and [[students]], and encourages teacher collaboration via broadband technology using the [[Moodle]] online learning support system.

Discover Sensors now has 190 participating schools throughout [[Ireland]]. If you are a Junior Certificate Science teacher, Discover Sensors can assist you by bringing new learning opportunities to your students using sensor technology.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]], [[Greenwave]] and [[Science.ie]].

'''Edgar Cayce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|iː}}; March 18, 1877&amp;nbsp;– January 3, 1945) was an American [[clairvoyant]] who answered questions on subjects as varied as [[healing]], reincarnation, wars, [[Atlantis]], and future events while claiming to be in a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].  A biographer gave him the nickname, '''The Sleeping Prophet'''. A nonprofit organization, the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]],&lt;ref name='ARE About/Mission'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1036 | title = About A.R.E. and Our Mission | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded to facilitate the study of Cayce's work.

Some consider him the true founder and a principal source of the most characteristic beliefs of the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements |first=Michael |last=York |year=1995 |page=60 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-8001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce is also notable for his contributions to the notions of diet and health, particularly the issues of [[food combining]], [[acid/alkaline diet]], and the [[Food therapy|therapeutic use of food]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edgar Cayce was born on March 18, 1877, near [[Beverly, Kentucky|Beverly]], south of [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. He was one of six children of [[farmers]] Carrie Elizabeth (née Major)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88291563/carrie-elizabeth-cayce|title=Carrie Elizabeth Major Cayce (1855-1927) - Find A...|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie Burr Cayce.&lt;ref name='ARE Chronology'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx?id=1971 | title = Chronology | accessdate = December 18, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, he played with the 'little folk'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather. He regarded them all as incorporeal because he could see through them if he looked hard enough.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  However, he found it very difficult to keep his mind on his lessons at school.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 35–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was taken to church when he was 10, and from then he read the Bible, becoming engrossed, and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In May 1889, while reading the Bible in his hut in the woods, he 'saw' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered, and asked him what he wanted most of all. He was frightened, but he said that most of all he wanted to help others, especially sick children.  He decided he would like to be a missionary.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next night, after a complaint from the school teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation.  At that point, Cayce 'heard' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before.  She told him that if he could sleep a little 'they' could help him.  He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book.  When his father came back into the room and woke him up, he knew all the answers.  In fact, he could repeat anything in the book.  His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again.  Eventually, Cayce used all his school books that way.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 46–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1892, the teacher regarded Cayce as his best student. On being questioned, Cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books. His father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around, resulting in Cayce becoming "different" from his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this, Cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep.  He was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game, after which he began to act very strangely, and eventually was put to bed. He went to sleep and diagnosed the cure, which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept.  His father boasted that his son was, "the greatest fellow in the world when he's asleep."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this ability was not demonstrated again for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce's uncommon personality is also shown in an unusual incident in which he rode a certain mule back to the farmhouse at the end of a work day.  This stunned everyone there, as the mule could not be ridden. The owner, thinking it may be time to break the animal in again, attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off.  Cayce left for his family in the city that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1893 to 1912: Kentucky period===
{{Christian mysticism}}
In December 1893, the Cayce family moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and occupied 705 West Seventh on the southeast corner of Seventh and Young Streets. During this time, Cayce received an eighth-grade education, is said by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] to have developed psychic abilities,&lt;ref name='ARE Bio'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edgarcayce.org/are/edgarcayce.aspx | title = About Edgar Cayce | accessdate = December 19, 2011 | publisher = [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the family farm to pursue various forms of employment.

Cayce's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved.&lt;ref name="MM_13"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-grade education was often considered more than sufficient for working-class children. Much of the remainder of Cayce's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money. On March 14, 1897, Cayce became engaged to Gertrude Evans.

Throughout his life, Cayce was drawn to church as a member of the Disciples of Christ. He read the [[Bible]] once a year every year, taught at [[Sunday school]],&lt;ref name="ARB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited missionaries. He said he could see [[wikt:aura|aura]]s around people, spoke to angels, and heard voices of departed relatives. In his early years, he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=There Is a River|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|publisher=A.R.E. Press (50th Anniversary edition)|year=1942|isbn=0876042353|location=Virginia Beach, VA|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Cayce formed a business partnership with his father to sell [[Woodmen of the World]] [[Insurance]]; however, in March he was struck by severe [[laryngitis]] that resulted in a complete loss of speech.&lt;ref name="MM_13"/&gt; Unable to work, he lived at home with his parents for almost a year. He then decided to take up the trade of [[photography]], an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice. He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and eventually became quite talented in his trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, a traveling stage [[hypnotist]] and entertainer named Hart, who referred to himself as "The Laugh Man", was performing at the Hopkinsville Opera House. Hart heard about Cayce's condition and offered to attempt a cure. Cayce accepted his offer, and the experiment was conducted in the office of Manning Brown, the local throat specialist. Cayce's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening. Hart tried a posthypnotic suggestion that the voice would continue to function after the trance, but this proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="MM_14"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Hart had appointments at other cities, he could not continue his hypnotic treatments of Cayce, but admitted he had failed because Cayce would not go into the third stage of hypnosis to take a suggestion.  A New York hypnotist, Dr Quackenboss, found the same impediment but, after returning to New York, suggested that Cayce should be prompted to take over his own case while in the second stage of hypnosis. The only local hypnotist, Al Layne, offered to help Cayce restore his voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 116-120&lt;/ref&gt; Layne suggested that Cayce describe the nature of his condition and cure while in a hypnotic trance.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; Cayce described his own ailment from a first-person plural point of view: "we" instead of the singular "I".&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; In subsequent sessions, when Cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the "entity" of the person that was requesting the reading, he would generally start off with, "We have the body." According to the reading for the "entity" of Cayce, his voice loss was due to psychological paralysis, and could be corrected by increasing the blood flow to the voice box. Layne suggested that the blood flow be increased and Cayce's face supposedly became flushed with blood, and both his [[chest]] and [[throat]] turned bright red.&lt;ref name="MM_14"/&gt; After 20 minutes, Cayce, still in a trance, declared the treatment over. On awakening, his voice was alleged to have remained normal. Apparently, relapses occurred, but were said to have been corrected by Layne in the same way, and eventually the cure was said to be permanent.

Layne had read of similar hypnotic cures by the [[Marquis de Puységur]], a follower of [[Franz Mesmer]], and was keen to explore the limits of the healing knowledge involved with the trance voice.&lt;ref name="MM_15"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 123–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the [[newspaper]]s, which inspired many postal inquiries.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt; Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and  location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed "the entity," and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him.  Few people knew what he was up to.  There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.

In May 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] where he boarded with some young professionals, two of whom were doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost his voice while there and Layne came to help effect the normal cure, finally visiting every week.  Cayce, still worried, kept the meetings secret, and continued to refuse money for his readings.  He invented a card game called ''[[Pit (game)|Pit]]'' or ''Board of Trade'', simulating wheat market trading, that became popular, but when he sent the idea to a game company they copyrighted it and he got no returns. He still refused to give readings for money.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 134–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and Gertrude Evans married on June 17, 1903, and she moved to Bowling Green with him. They had three children: Hugh Lynn Cayce (March 16, 1907 – July 4, 1982), Milton Porter Cayce (March 28, 1911 – May 17, 1911), and Edgar Evans Cayce (February 9, 1918 – February 15, 2013).&lt;ref name="ARE Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Virginian Pilot (obituaries) Feb 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She still disapproved of the readings, and Cayce still agonized over the morality of them.  A few days later Layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house, one of whom was a magistrate and journalist, after which state medical authorities forced Layne to close his practice. He left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in Franklin.  Cayce and Gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could, greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in Bowling Green, while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon, with Cayce’s co-operation. All the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings. However, Cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business. After a violent examination by doctors while in a trance, Cayce refused any more investigations, declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 146–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios, leading to bankruptcy.  Between the two fires, his first son was born on March 16, 1907. He became debt free by 1909, although completely broke, and ready to start again.  In 1907, outstanding diagnostic successes in the family helped his confidence. He again refused an offer to go into business, this time with homeopath Wesley H. Ketchum from Hopkinsville, who was introduced by his father.  He found a job at the H. P. Tresslar photography firm.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 161–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ketchum was persistent, spread information in various medical circles, and in October 1910 got written up in the press.  When a reporter contacted Cayce, he explained to the reporter that he somehow had the ability to easily go into the intuitive sleep when he wanted to, and this was different from how he went to sleep normally like everyone else. When asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method, they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 175–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ketchum again urged Cayce to join a business company. After soul searching the whole night, Cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions, including that he did not take money for the readings.  Instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood, and build a separate office for the readings. The contract was modified to give 50% of the earnings to Cayce and his father. Cayce read the back readings, but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing.  He preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis, but only the doctors in Hopkinsville would cooperate, whereas most of the patients were not in that locality. Also, doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 180–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Cayce, and especially Gertrude, still did not give therapeutic priority to the readings and supposedly lost their second child due to this reticence. When Gertrude became fatally ill with tuberculosis, they used the readings after the doctor had given up. Miraculously, the treatment cured her. Shortly after this, in 1912, Cayce, whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings, discovered that Ketchum had not been honest about them, and had also used them to gamble for finance.  He argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them. Cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the Tresslar photography firm in Selma, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 191–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912 to 1923: Selma, Alabama period===
[[File:Cayce Selma AL DCP 0924.JPG|thumb|right|Historic marker in downtown [[Selma, Alabama]], in front of the building where Cayce lived and worked from 1912 to 1923.]]

Cayce's work grew in volume as his fame grew. He asked for voluntary donations to support himself and his family so that he could practice full-time. To help raise money he invented [[Pit (game)|''Pit'']], a card game based on the commodities trading at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], and the game is still sold today. He continued to work in an apparent trance state with a hypnotist all his life. His wife and eldest son later replaced Layne in this role. A secretary, Gladys Davis, recorded his readings in shorthand.&lt;ref name="MM_19"/&gt;

The growing fame of Cayce along with the popularity he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.&lt;ref name="MM_19"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Arthur Lammers, a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics, persuaded Cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce was told by Lammers that, while in his trance state, he spoke of Lammers' past lives and of [[reincarnation]], something Lammers believed in. Reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but is not an accepted part of Christian doctrine. Because of this, Cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced. He challenged Lammers' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue:

:Cayce: I said all that?... I couldn't have said all that in one reading.
:Lammers: No. But you confirmed it. You see, I have been studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cayce's stenographer recorded the following:

:In this we see the plan of development of those individuals set upon this plane, meaning the ability to enter again into the presence of the Creator and become a full part of that creation.
:Insofar as this entity is concerned, this is the third appearance on this plane, and before this one, as the monk. We see glimpses in the life of the entity now as were shown in the monk, in this mode of living. The body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same.

Cayce was quite unconvinced that he had been referring to the doctrine of reincarnation, and the best Lammers could offer was that the reading "opens up the door" and to go on to share his beliefs and knowledge with Cayce.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with Cayce and seemed intent upon convincing Cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that 12 years earlier Cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation. In reading 4841-1, given April 22, 1911, Cayce referred to the soul being "transmigrated." Because Cayce's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923, it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings.

=== 1923 to 1925: Dayton, Ohio period ===
Lammers asked Cayce to come to Dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings.  Cayce eventually agreed and went to Dayton. Gertrude Cayce was dubious but interested. There, Cayce produced much metaphysical information, which Cayce tried to reconcile with Christianity. Lammers declared that the fifth chapter of Matthew was the constitution of Christianity and the Sermon on the Mount was its Declaration of Independence.  It appeared that Cayce's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 234–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayce reported that his conscience bothered him severely over this conflict. His readings of reincarnations were going against his biblical teachings and at one point he wanted to cease his channeling sessions. Once again Cayce lost his voice and in a reading for himself he was informed if he was no longer going to be a channel, his mission in this life was complete. Ultimately his trance voice, the "we" of the readings, dialogued with Cayce and finally persuaded him to continue with these kinds of readings.&lt;ref name="MM_25"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Lammers wanted to ask the readings the purpose of Cayce's clairvoyance, and to put up money for an organisation supporting Cayce's healing methods.  Cayce decided to accept the work and  asked his family to join him in Dayton as soon as they could. But by the time the Cayces had arrived there, near the end of 1923, Lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use.  Cayce used his knowledge of the Bible to convince his family that it agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 243–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this time Cayce directed his activities to provide readings centred around health. The remedies that were channeled often involved the use of unusual electrotherapy, ultraviolet light, diet, massage, gemstones, less mental work and more relaxation in sand on the beach. His remedies were coming under the scrutiny of the American Medical Association and Cayce felt that it was time to legitimize the operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners. In 1925 Cayce reported while in a trance, "the voice" had instructed him to move to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; across the street from the beach. He was informed that the sand's crystals would have curative properties to promote rapid healing.

===1925 to 1945: Virginia Beach period===
[[File:Cayce Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|The Cayce Hospital 2006]]
Cayce's mature period, in which he created the several institutions that survived him, can be considered to have started in 1925. By this time he was a professional psychic with a small number of employees and volunteers.&lt;ref name="AAR"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The readings increasingly came to involve occult or esoteric themes.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, ch. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money was extremely scarce, but help came from interested persons.  The idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again, but the readings insisted on Virginia Beach, not suiting most of the people. Gertrude Cayce began to conduct all the readings. Morton Blumenthal, a young man who worked in the stock exchange in New York with his trader brother, became very interested in the readings, shared Cayce's outlook, and offered to finance the vision in the right spirit. He bought them a house at Virginia Beach.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 267–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 1927, the Association of National Investigations was incorporated in the state of Virginia. This would manage building the hospital and a scientific study of the readings. Morton was president and his brother and several others were vice presidents. Cayce was secretary and treasurer, and Gladys was assistant secretary. To protect against legal prosecution, the rules required any person requesting a reading to become a member of the Association and agree they were participating in an experiment in psychic research.  Early in 1928, Dr Moseley Brown, head of the psychology dept at Washington and Lee University, became convinced of the readings and joined the Association.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 274–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1928, the dedication ceremonies for the hospital complex were held.  It contained a lecture hall, library, vault for storage of the readings, and offices for research workers. There was also a large living room, a 12-car garage, servants quarters, and a tennis court. It contained "the largest lawn, in fact the only lawn, between the Cavalier and Cape Henry." The first patient was admitted the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 281–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This facility would enable consistent checking and rechecking of the remedies, which was Cayce's goal.  There were consistent remedies for many of the illnesses regardless of the patient, and Cayce hoped to produce a compendium that could be used by the medical profession.  A distinguished chemist, Dr Sunker A. Bisley, DPhil (Oxon), who also used psychic knowledge to produce medicines, collaborated with Cayce to produce [[Atomidine]], an absorbable form of iodine, which was perfected and sold.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 285–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic raison d'etre for all the cures was the "assimilation of needed properties through the digestive system, from food taken into the body… [All treatments, including all schools and types of treatment, were given in order to establish] the proper equilibrium of the assimilating system."&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Therapies as divergent as salt packs, poultices, hot compresses, [[Chromotherapy|color healing]], magnetism, vibrator treatment, massage, osteopathic manipulation, dental therapy, colonics, enemas, antiseptics, inhalants, homeopathics, essential oils, mud baths were prescribed.  Substances used included oils, salts, herbs, iodine, witch hazel, magnesia, bismuth, alcohol, castoria, lactated pepsin, turpentine, charcoal, animated ash, soda, cream of tartar, aconite, laudanum, camphor, and gold solution.  These were prescribed to overcome conditions that prevented proper digestion and assimilation of needed nutrients from the prescribed diet. The aim of the readings was to produce a healthy body, removing the cause of the specific ailment.  Readings would indicate if the patient's recovery was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 290–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a waiting list of months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 295, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Blumenthal and Brown went ahead with ambitious plans for a university as a supplement to the hospital and a "parallel service for the mind and spirit".  In fact, it was to dwarf the hospital and rival other universities in respectability before psychic studies would begin. It was to open on September 22, 1930.   On September 16 Blumenthal  called a meeting of the Association resulting in his ownership of the hospital to curb expenses.  After the first semester he ceased his support of the university, and on February 26, 1931, closed down the Association.  Cayce removed the files of the readings from the hospital and took them home.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 306–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression|Depression]] years saw Cayce turn his attention to spiritual teachings. In 1931, Edgar Cayce's friends and family asked him how they could become psychic like him. Out of this seemingly simple question came an eleven-year discourse that led to the creation of  "Study Groups". From his altered state, Cayce relayed to this group that the purpose of life is not to become psychic, but to become a more spiritually aware and loving person. Study Group #1 was told that they could "bring light to a waiting world" and that these lessons would still be studied a hundred years into the future. The readings were now about dreams, coincidence (synchronicity), developing intuition, karma, the akashic records, astrology, past-life relationships, soul mates and other esoteric subjects. Hundreds of books have been published about these readings.

June 6, 1931, 61 people attended a meeting to carry on the work and form a new organization called the Association for Research and Enlightenment. In July the new association was incorporated, and Cayce legally returned the house to Blumenthal and bought another place.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 317–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn proposed that they develop a stock in trade rather than something  grandiose, and that they build a library of research into the phenomena and hold study groups, and that Cayce would do two readings a day. The association accepted this, and Hugh Lynn also started a monthly bulletin for association members. The bulletin contained readings on general interest subjects, interesting cases, book reviews on psychic subjects, health hints from readings, and news of psychic phenomena in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 324–328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Lynn narrowed the mailing list to some 300 members who were genuinely enthusiastic, and as a result the first annual congress of the association was held in June 1932.  He procured speakers on various metaphysical and psychic subjects and included public readings by Cayce.  Members left the conference eager to start study groups in their own localities.   Records were kept of everything that went on in the readings including the attitudes and routines of Cayce. Everything was then checked with the subjects of the readings, most of whom were not present during the reading, and the data was published in a study entitled "100 cases of clairvoyance."   However, the response from scientists in general was that none of the experiments were performed under test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 330–333.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hugh Lynn continued to build files of case histories, parallel studies in psychic phenomena, and research readings for the study groups.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

Association activities remained simple and un-publicized.  Members raised a building fund for an office, library, and vault, which they erected in 1940-1 as a single unit added on to the Cayce residence.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7, 354&lt;/ref&gt;  No sign guided visitors to the centre.  Association membership averaged 500 to 600. The turnover from year to year was approximately half this total.  The other half remained a solid basis for the research work, an audience for case studies, pamphlets, bulletins—and the Congress bulletin, which was a yearbook and record of congress events. A mailing list of several thousand served people who remained interested in Cayce's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 346–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Members were drawn from all of the Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions.  Cayce's philosophy was, if it makes you a better member of your church then it's good; if it takes you away from your church, it's bad.  The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization.  The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 348–350.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Both sons entered the forces during the war.  They both married, Hugh Lynn in 1941 and Edgar Evans in 1942.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"&gt;Sugrue 2003, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In March 1943 the first edition of the only biography written during Cayce's lifetime, by Thomas Sugrue, was published.  As a consequence, public demand increased. Office staff had to be increased, and the mailman could no longer carry all the mail so Gertrude got it from the post office by car.  Hugh Lynn was away in the forces, and Cayce coped with the letters and increased his readings to four to six per day.&lt;ref name="Sugrue 2003, p. 355"/&gt;

Cayce gained national prominence in 1943 after the publication of a high-profile article in the magazine ''[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]]'' titled "Miracle Man of Virginia Beach".&lt;ref name="AAR"/&gt; [[World War II]] was taking its toll on American soldiers and he felt he could not refuse the families who requested help for their loved ones who were missing in action. He increased the frequency of his readings to eight per day to try to make an impression on the ever-growing pile of requests. He said this took a toll on his health as it was emotionally draining and often fatigued him. The readings themselves scolded him for attempting too much and that he should limit his workload to just two life readings a day or else these good efforts would eventually kill him.&lt;ref&gt;

From June 1943 to June 1944, 1,385 readings were taken.  By August 1944 Cayce collapsed from strain.  When he gave a reading on this situation, the instructions were to rest until he was well or dead. He and Gertrude went away to the mountains of Virginia, but in September Edgar Cayce suffered a [[stroke]] at the age of 67, in September 1944, and died on January 3, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;

After the death of Cayce the Association continued the work of classifying and cross referring the over 14,000 files of readings that had been taken throughout Cayce's lifetime from March 31, 1901, to September 17, 1944. The results of these have been disseminated through the Associations publications with the members as the recipients of this material.&lt;ref&gt;Sugrue 2003, pp. 356–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims for psychic abilities==

Until September 1923, his readings were not systematically recorded or preserved. However, an article published in the ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' on October 10, 1922, quotes Cayce as saying that he had given 8,056 readings as of that date and it is known that he gave approximately 13,000–14,000 readings after that date. A total of 14,306 are available at the A.R.E. Cayce headquarters in Virginia Beach and on an online member-only section along with background information, correspondence, and follow-up documentation.&lt;ref&gt;EdgarCayce.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Other abilities that have been attributed to Cayce include [[astral projection]], [[prophecy|prophesying]], [[mediumship]], viewing the [[Akashic records]] or "[[Book of Life]]", and seeing [[aura (paranormal)|aura]]s. Cayce said he became interested in learning more about these subjects after he was informed about the content of his readings, which he reported that he never actually heard himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bro, Harmon Hartzell. ''Edgar Cayce: A Seer out of Season'', Aquarian Press, London, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters==
Cayce's clients included a number of famous people such as [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Irving Berlin]], and [[George Gershwin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar Cayce: an American prophet'', Sidney Kirkpatrick, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gina Cerminara]] published books such as ''Many Mansions'' and ''The World Within''. [[Brian Weiss]] published a bestseller regarding clinical recollection of past lives, ''Many Lives, Many Masters''. These books provide broad support for [[spiritualism]] and reincarnation. ''Many Mansions'' elaborates on Cayce's work and supports his stated abilities with real life examples.

In 1971 Edgar Cayce's sons Edgar Evans Cayce and Hugh Lynn Cayce published a book titled ''The Outer Limits of Edgar Cayce's Power'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/148598|title=The outer limits of Edgar Cayce's power|last=Evans.|first=Cayce, Edgar|others=Cayce, Hugh Lynn,|isbn=1931044686|edition= First|location=New York|oclc=148598}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming Cayce's readings had an approximate 85% success rate. The majority of the book investigated cases where Cayce's readings were demonstrably incorrect.

===Wesley Harrington Ketchum===

Ketchum was a physician who worked with Cayce in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo_WpADB9_gC&amp;pg=PA180-IA6&amp;lpg=PA180-IA6&amp;dq=Wesley+Harrington+Ketchum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b1fca1WSYU&amp;sig=oUNIalki2fuKOXSxcwwaM60rJ5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MeKHU7zrOdOSqgajsoGQCQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Wesley%20Harrington%20Ketchum&amp;f=false |title=The Story of Edgar Cayce: There Is a River - Thomas Sugrue - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJH__A8xgDgC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Wesley+Harrington+Ketchum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nq93POjRJj&amp;sig=8CSv55s8WZZdoH6M1R53q92WV5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2eGHU_SRLpOQqAbOn4DQBg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=Wesley%20Harrington%20Ketchum&amp;f=false |title=The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce?: Interdimensional Communication and Global ... - Wynn Free, David Wilcock - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchum himself was born in Lisbon, Ohio on November 11, 1878, to Saunders C. Ketchum and Bertha Bennett, and was the oldest of 7 children.  He graduated from the Cleveland College of Homeopathic Medicine in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Original Articles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;dq=wesley+harrington+ketchum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P1zXeUJwBt&amp;sig=AWVEEFSWTUGavU3oN0rOmLaIuJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BmyLU-ymDpPqoAT4yICoCA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCg |work= Cleveland Medical and Surgical Reporter |volume= 12 |page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took up the practice of medicine in Hopkinsville Kentucky.  He practiced medicine in Hopkinsville until 1912.  In 1913 he traveled across country to San Francisco, and took passage to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he opened a new practice.  He returned to California in 1918, and established an office in Palo Alto California, practicing medicine there until the 1950s.  He retired to Southern California around 1963, settling in San Marino, just outside Pasadena.  He died on November 28, 1968, in Canoga Park, California.

He wrote ''The Discovery of Edgar Cayce'', published by the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment|A.R.E. Press]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/discovery-of-edgar-cayce/oclc/3537711 |title=The discovery of Edgar Cayce, (Book, 1964) |publisher=[WorldCat.org] |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism== &lt;!-- This section is referenced in [[Atomidine]] article, if you change the title please change the link --&gt;

===Controversy===
Cayce advocated some controversial ideas in his trance readings. In many trance sessions, he interpreted the history of life on Earth. One of Cayce's controversial claims was that of [[polygenism]]. According to Cayce, five human races (white, black, red, brown, and yellow) had been created separately but simultaneously on different parts of the Earth. Cayce also accepted the existence of aliens and [[Atlantis]], and claimed that "the red race developed in Atlantis and its development was rapid." Another claim by Cayce was that "soul-entities" on Earth intermingled with animals to produce "things": giants that were as much as twelve feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;Orser, Charles E. (2004). ''Race and Practice in Archaeological Interpretation''. p. 68. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-3750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Olav Hammer]] wrote that many of Cayce's readings discussed race and skin color and that the explanation for this is that Cayce was not a racist but was influenced by the occult ideas of [[Helena Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]]. (2001). ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age''. Brill Academic Publishing. p. 114 and the footnote at the bottom of the page. {{ISBN|978-9004120167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cayce declared that the [[Piltdown man]] was genuine, claiming he was an Atlantean colonizer who had travelled to Britain.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"&gt;Fagan, Garrett G. (2002). ''Alternative Archaeology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC--CLIO. pp. 9-16. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Piltdown man was exposed as a [[hoax]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Fagan 2002"/&gt;

Philosopher and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]], in his book ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', wrote, "Cayce is one of the main people responsible for some of the sillier notions about Atlantis." Carroll mentioned some of Cayce's ideas, including his belief in a giant solar crystal, activated by the sun, and used to harness energy and provide power on Atlantis, and his prediction that in 1958, the United States would rediscover a death ray that had been used on Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert Todd]]. (2003). ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''. Wiley. p. 69. {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930s, Cayce also incorrectly predicted that  North America would experience chaos: "Los Angeles, San Francisco... will be among those that will be destroyed before New York". These events were to have happened "in the period of '58 to '98".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/profecias/esp_profecia01h4.htm|title=American Prophecy - 4|website=www.bibliotecapleyades.net|access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Skeptics challenge Cayce's alleged [[psychic]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |first=Martin |last=Gardner |authorlink=Martin Gardner |year=1957 |pages=216–219 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Randi |authorlink=James Randi |year=1982 |title=[[The Truth About Uri Geller]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |page=195 |isbn=0-87975-199-1 |quote=The matter of Edgar Cayce boils down to a vague mass of garbled data, interpreted by true believers who have a very heavy stake in the acceptance of the claims. Put to the test, Cayce is found to be bereft of powers. His reputation today rests on poor and deceptive reporting of the claims made by him and his followers, and such claims do not stand up to examination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical health experts are critical of Cayce's unorthodox treatments, which they regard as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Renner, John H. (1990). ''HealthSmarts: How to Spot the Quacks, Avoid the Nonsense, and Get the Facts that Affect Your Health''. Health Facts Publishing. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-0962614507}} "Some quacks, such as Edgar Cayce, attributed their powers to God. Cayce, who made his diagnoses while in trance, claimed that his healing powers came from God. To treat patients he used spinal manipulation as well as Red Bug Juice and Oil of Smoke in his cures."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raso, Jack. [http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/cayce.html ''The Legacies of Edgar Cayce'']. Quackwatch. Retrieved January 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writers and [[Skepticism|skeptics]] have suggested that the evidence for Cayce's alleged psychic powers comes from contemporaneous [[newspaper]] articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials, and books. [[Martin Gardner]], for example, wrote that while Cayce's [[trance]]s did happen, most of the information from his trances was derived from books that Cayce had been reading by authors such as [[Carl Jung]], [[P. D. Ouspensky]], and [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Gardner's hypothesis was that the trance readings of Cayce contain, "little bits of information gleaned from here and there in the occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce's unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;[[K. Paul Johnson|Johnson, K. Paul]]. (1998). ''Edgar Cayce in Context: The Readings, Truth and Fiction''. State University of New York Press. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0791439067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]] writes in ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', "Uneducated beyond the ninth grade, Cayce acquired his broad knowledge through voracious reading and from this he wove elaborate tales."&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]]. ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time]]'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-8050-7089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shermer wrote that, "Cayce was fantasy-prone from his youth, often talking with angels and receiving visions of his dead grandfather." Magician [[James Randi]] has said that "Cayce was fond of expressions like 'I feel that' and 'perhaps'—qualifying words used to avoid positive declarations." Examination of the readings do not show qualifying terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1992). ''Missing Pieces: How to Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, &amp; Other Mysteries''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|0-87975-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Cayce was never subjected to proper testing, ESP pioneer [[Joseph Banks Rhine|Joseph B. Rhine]] of Duke University — who should have been sympathetic to Cayce's claims — was unimpressed. A reading that Cayce gave for Rhine's daughter was notably inaccurate. Frequently, Cayce was even wider off the mark, as when he provided diagnoses of subjects ''who had died'' since the letters requesting the readings were sent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. p. 159. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science writer [[Karen Stollznow]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The reality is that his cures were hearsay and his treatments were folk remedies that were useless at best and dangerous at worse&amp;nbsp;... Cayce wasn't able to cure his own cousin, or his own son who died as a baby. Many of Cayce's readings took place after the patient had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Stollznow, Karen. (2014). ''Language Myths, Mysteries and Magic''. Palgrave Macmillan. p 103. {{ISBN|978-1-137-40484-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Experimentum crucis''}}
In the [[science]]s, an '''''experimentum crucis''''' ([[English language|English]]: '''crucial experiment''' or '''critical experiment''') is an [[experiment]] capable of decisively determining whether or not a particular [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] is superior to all other hypotheses or theories whose acceptance is currently widespread in the scientific community. In particular, such an experiment must typically be able to produce a result that rules out all other hypotheses or theories if true, thereby demonstrating that under the conditions of the experiment (''i.e.'', [[Ceteris paribus|under the same external circumstances]] and for the same "input variables" within the experiment), those hypotheses and theories are ''proven false'' but the experimenter's hypothesis ''is not ruled out''.

For an opposite view putting into question the decisive value of the experimentum crucis in choosing one hypothesis or theory over its rival see [[Pierre Duhem]].

==History==
[[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'' first described the concept of a situation in which one theory but not others would hold true, using the name '''''instantia crucis'''''; the phrase ''experimentum crucis'', denoting the deliberate creation of such a situation for the purpose of testing the rival theories, was later coined by [[Robert Hooke]] and then famously used by [[Isaac Newton]].

The production of such an experiment is considered necessary for a particular hypothesis or theory to be considered an established part of the body of scientific knowledge. It is not unusual in the history of science for theories to be developed fully before producing a critical experiment. A given theory which is in accordance with known experiment but which has not yet produced a critical experiment is typically considered worthy of exploration in order to discover such an experimental test.

==Examples==
In his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] (1687) presents a disproof of [[Descartes' vortex theory]] of the motion of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton (1687), ''Principia Mathematica'' Book iii, Proposition 43, General Scholium and Book ii,  Section ix, Proposition 53, as referenced by [[William Stanley Jevons]] (1874), ''The Principles of Science: A Treatise on Logic and Scientific Method'' p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Opticks]]'', Newton describes an optical ''experimentum crucis'' in the ''First Book, Part I, Proposition II, Theorem II, Experiment 6'', to prove that sunlight consists of rays that differ in their [[index of refraction]].

[[File:Newton's Experimentum Crucis (Grusche 2015).jpg|thumb|700px|Isaac Newton performing his crucial prism experiment – the 'experimentum crucis' – in his [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] bedroom. Acrylic painting by Sascha Grusche (17 Dec 2015)]]

A 19th-century example was the prediction by [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]], based on [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel's]] mathematical analysis, that the [[wave theory of light]] predicted a bright spot in the center of the shadow of a perfectly circular object, a result that could not be explained by the (then current) particle theory of light. An experiment by [[François Arago]] showed the existence of this effect, now called the [[Arago spot]], or "Poisson's bright spot", which led to the acceptance of the wave theory.

A famous example in the 20th century of an ''experimentum crucis'' was the expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington]] to [[Principe Island]] in [[Africa]] in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the [[Sun]] during a [[solar eclipse]]. The observation of star positions confirmed predictions of [[gravitational lensing]] made by [[Albert Einstein]] in the [[general theory of relativity]] published in 1915. Eddington's observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favor of Einstein's theory.

In some cases, a proposed theory can account for existing anomalous experimental results for which no other existing theory can furnish an explanation. An example would be the ability of the [[quantum hypothesis]], proposed by [[Max Planck]] in 1900, to account for the observed [[black-body spectrum]], an experimental result that the existing [[classical physics|classical]] [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] could not predict. Such cases are not considered strong enough to fully establish a new theory, however, and in the case of quantum mechanics, it took the confirmation of the theory through ''new'' predictions for the theory to gain full acceptance.

The '''National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development''' (Spanish: ''Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico''), abbreviated '''FONDECYT''', is the main public fund of the [[Government of Chile]] to promote basic scientific and technological research in all areas of knowledge. It is managed by the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research ([[CONICYT]]).

The fund was established in 1981 and began operations in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FONDECYT: un análisis de su evolución (1982-1995)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-xcAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Corporación de Promoción Universitaria|page=3|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has funded more than 16,000 research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FONDECYT: Historia|url=http://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/sobre-fondecyt/historia/|publisher=CONICYT|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 CONICYT opened a second fund, FONDEF (The Science &amp; Technology Development Fund), with the aim of promoting public&amp;ndash;private collaboration in research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FONTEC and FONDEF: Driving Chilean technological development|url=https://innovationpolicyplatform.org/sites/default/files/rdf_imported_documents/FONTEC-FONDEF.pdf|author=The Innovation Policy Platform|year=2013|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Five Billion Years of Change: A History of the Land''''' (2003, {{ISBN|157230958X}}) is a book by [[Denis Wood]] that attempts a [[holism|holistic]] view of reality that ranges from the [[Big Bang]] to the [[World Wide Web]]. Specifically, this books deals with the formation of various structures:
*the [[universe]]
*the [[Earth]] and its [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s, and [[continent]]s
*the [[origin of life]]
*the evolution of [[human]]s
*the development of [[agriculture]]
*the rise and fall of [[civilization]]s
*contemporary [[globalization]]&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Denis |title=Five Billion Years of Global Change: A History of the Land |url=https://www.amazon.com/Five-Billion-Years-Global-Change/dp/157230958X|accessdate=June 2014|edition=1st Paperback|date=2003 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|isbn=157230958X|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key [[theme (literary)|theme]] is repeated through this book: humans have a tendency to divide our understandings into "[[history]]" and "[[prehistory]]". People are shocked when some event from prehistory intrudes upon their current lives; Wood likens the shock of this intrusion to an expulsion from the [[Garden of Eden]].  This division is a metaphor for various artificial divisions; for example:
*the formation of the earth, the pre-biotic chemistry, and the [[origin of life]]
*before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and our subsequent modern era
Instead of thinking in terms of artificial divisions of "now" and "back then", readers should develop an intuitive mindset of graduated changes in which the "[[fossil]]s" of the ancient past are intermingled with contemporary objects; for instance, the "[[oxygen catastrophe|oxygen holocaust]]" of the [[paleoproterozoic]] eon exists in today's oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Also, the [[hero]]ic saga induces another faulty thinking style that obscures the true nature of the world.  To understand the real story of humanity, Wood argues that people must focus on the mass actions of people or of large impersonal forces rather than a few heroes or kings.  [[Hollywood]] movies dealing with ecological threats are especially misleading; rather than imparting an accurate image of ecological issues, movies present a [[villain]] such as a [[mad scientist]] or a greedy, evil [[business]] person.  Instead, such entertainment and much news reporting distracts us from our individual actions that are at the heart of ecological problems.

Inaccurate ways of thinking induce a passive [[learned helplessness|helplessness]].  Instead, by presenting a sweeping story of successive, interlinked, long term trends, the author hopes to give readers a flexible, authentic [[Physical model|model]] of the world.  With that model, readers will be capable of understanding (and possibly dealing with) current global challenges.

== Description ==

The discipline of functional medicine is vaguely defined by its proponents.&lt;ref name=quackademic/&gt; Oncologist [[David Gorski]] has written that the vagueness is a deliberate tactic which facilitates the discipline's promotion, but that in general it centers on unnecessary and expensive testing procedures performed in the name of "holistic" health care.&lt;ref name=gorski1016&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/functional-medicine-the-ultimate-misnomer-in-the-world-of-integrative-medicine/ |title=Functional medicine: The ultimate misnomer in the world of integrative medicine |last=Gorski |first=David |date=11 April 2016 |website=Science Based Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of functional medicine oppose established medical knowledge and reject its models, instead adopting a model of disease based on the notion of "antecedents", "triggers", and "mediators".&lt;ref name=patient/&gt; These are meant to correspond to the underlying causes, the immediate causes, and the particular characteristics of a person's illness respectively.&lt;ref name=patient&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Patient |title=Therapies and Theories Outside Traditional Medicine |accessdate=11 December 2015 |author=Knott L |url=http://patient.info/doctor/therapies-and-theories-outside-traditional-medicine |date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A functional medicine practitioner will devise a "matrix" from these things which acts as a basis for treatment.&lt;ref name=patient/&gt;

The '''Goodman fatigue equation''' is used by engineers for [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] analysis. The equation is used to make [[correlation]]s of experimental fatigue data of [[metals]] and other materials.

The equation is also used to determine the failure mechanisms of sucker rods in pumping [[oil well]]s worldwide, and to help design new sucker rod strings for rod-pumped oil wells.

== Sources ==
From similar triangles the Goodman fatigue equation is :

( 4a)         τm /Sus + τa /Ses   =   1/n       in which the stress components are given by 
                                      τm   =   Ks 8 FmC / πd2     where   Fm   =   ( Fhi + Flo ) /2     and 
                                      τa   =   Kh 8 Fa C / πd2    where   Fa   =   ( Fhi - Flo ) /2

The '''huff and puff apparatus''' is used in school [[biology]] labs to demonstrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is a product of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as [[limewater]] or [[bicarbonate indicator]] shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath.This turns the bicarbonate into milky white substance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M.

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1583">In [[economics]] and [[social policy]], '''infrastructure bias''' is the influence of the location and availability of pre-existing [[infrastructure]], such as roads and telecommunications facilities, on social and economic development.

----

In [[science]], '''infrastructure bias''' is the influence of existing social or scientific infrastructure on scientific observations.

In astronomy and [[particle physics]], where the availability of particular kinds of telescopes or particle accelerators acts as a constraint on the types of experiments that can be done, the data that can be retrieved is biased towards that which can be obtained by the equipment.

[[Procedural bias]], related to infrastructure bias, is shown by a case of irregular genetic sampling of Bolivian [[Solanum|wild potatoes]].&lt;ref name=DivaGIS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diva-gis.org/docs/bias.pdf | title= Assessing the geographic representativeness of genebank collections: The case of Bolivian wild potatoes| publisher= Diva Geographic Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 report of previous studies' sampling found that 60% of samples had been taken near towns or roads, where 22% would be the average, had the samples been taken at random&lt;ref name=DivaGIS/&gt; (or from equidistant points, or at specifically varying distances from towns, representative of the average terrain density).

The '''''Iron Science Teacher''''' is a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching. The competition originated at the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher 2011|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/march15-2011/iron_science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, “[[Iron Chef]],” this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher: At the Explo and Live Webcast|url=http://press.exploratorium.edu/iron-science-teacher-live-webcast-june-2011/|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Contestants are currently or formally part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher."  Shows are also archived on the [http://www.exploratorium.edu/tv/index.php?project=11 Exploratorium's site].

Astrophysicist Dr. Linda Shore, Director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute and host of the competition, says one goal of the Iron Science Teacher is to "provide teachers with ideas about how to teach multimillion dollar state and national science teaching standards using, trash, recyclables, and inexpensive materials" as well as "to allow teachers to receive applause for great teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.exo.net/~pauld/iron_science_teacher/ironsciencensta2003.html|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Back in 1997, the Exploratorium's Phyllis C. Wattis Webcast Studio was looking for new shows. During a staff brainstorming session, a fan of the popular Food Network television show, [[The Iron Chef]], suggested naming a secret ingredient for science teachers to use in an experiment to present to the audience. "It was honestly and truly a joke," Shore says. "We thought we'd do one show."&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/iron-science-teacher|publisher=District Administration|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Shows==
Now 10 to 12 shows are produced annually for the Exploratorium's website. "Secret" ingredients, which are revealed in advance to participants so they can practice, have included everything from ordinary baking soda and food coloring to Marshmallow Peeps and pantyhose.&lt;ref name=da /&gt;

==Spin-offs==
The Canadian Iron Science Teacher also parodies the popular TV series Iron Chef and is hosted by Jay Ingram of Daily Planet on Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=calgary /&gt;   Unlike the Exploratorium version, where championship comes with no tangible prize, in the Canadian version, five "finalist" teachers, with their support teams, are selected to compete in the Iron Science Teacher finals at the University of Calgary in order to win a variety of cash prizes.  

Colorado Springs, CO initiated their own CoOL Iron Science Teacher Competition as part of their What If: A Festival of Creativity &amp; Innovation on September 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Springs CoOL Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.coolscience.org/CoolScience/Teachers/CSCSF2010-IronScience.htm|publisher=Cool Science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''life sciences''' or '''biological sciences''' comprise the [[branches of science]] that involve the scientific study of [[life]] and [[organism]]s – such as [[microorganism]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s including [[human being]]s. 

Life science is one of the two major branches of [[natural science]], the other being [[physical Science|physical science]], which is concerned with non-living matter. 

By definition, [[biology]] is the [[natural science]] that studies life and living organisms, with the other life sciences being its sub-disciplines. 

Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, [[zoology]] is the study of [[animals]], while [[botany]] is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as [[anatomy]] and [[genetics]]. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]]) other on larger scales (e.g. [[Cell biology|cytology]], [[immunology]], [[ethology]], [[ecology]]). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the [[mind]]{{spaced ndash}}[[neuroscience]].

Life sciences discoveries are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life, and have applications in health, agriculture, medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries.

==Basic life science branches==
{{Main|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}

[[Biology]] &amp;ndash; burst and eclectic field, composed of many branches and sub-disciplines. However, despite the complexity and the broad scope of the science, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into a single, coherent field. Here are some of biology's major branches:
* [[Anatomy]] – study of form and function, in plants, animals, and other organisms, or specifically in humans
* [[Astrobiology]] – the study of the formation and presence of life in the universe
* [[Biochemistry]] – study of the chemical reactions required for life to exist and function, usually a focus on the cellular level

*[[Bioinformatics]] &amp;ndash; developing of methods or software tools for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data to generate useful biological knowledge

* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of the biology and evolution of language
*[[Biological Anthropology|Biological anthropology]] – the study of humans, non-human primates, and hominids. Also known as physical anthropology
*[[Biomechanics]] – the study of the mechanics of living beings
*[[Biophysics]] – study of biological processes by applying the theories and methods that have been traditionally used in the physical sciences
*[[Botany]] – study of plants

* [[Biopolymer]] &amp;ndash; [[polymer]]s produced by living organisms; in other words, they are polymeric [[biomolecule]]s. Since they are [[polymer]]s, biopolymers contain [[monomeric]] units that are covalently bonded to form larger structures. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomeric units used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: [[polynucleotide]]s ([[RNA]] and [[DNA]]), which are long polymers composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomers]]; [[polypeptides]], which are short polymers of amino acids; and [[polysaccharides]], which are often linear bonded polymeric carbohydrate structures.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, A.K., et al., ''Natural Fibers, Biopolymers, and Biocomposites'' (CRC Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, R., and Rustgi, R., "Biodegradable Polymers", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 23, p. 1273 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, M.A., et al., "Biological Materials: Structure &amp; Mechanical Properties", Progress in Materials Science, Vol. 53, p. 1 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A., et al., "Smart Polymers: Physical Forms &amp; Bioengineering Applications", Progress in Polymer Science, Vol. 32, p.1205 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73639">{{Main|Multiple discovery}}

Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in [[science]], of "[[multiple independent discovery]]". [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert K.|title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science|journal=European Journal of Sociology|date=December 1963|volume=4|issue=02|pages=237–282|doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801|jstor=23998345}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|author=Robert K. Merton|title=On Social Structure and Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226520714&amp;id=eprv7hMdO-IC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=multiples&amp;vq=multiples&amp;dq=Merton+multiples&amp;sig=U774PKmgujti7ktfBM2Z8tm2MDs|date=15 September 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-52070-4|pages=305–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Sometimes," writes Merton, "the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before."&lt;ref name="Merton1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert K. Merton|title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPvcHuUMEMwC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=%22Sometimes+the+discoveries+are+simultaneous+or+almost+so%22&amp;dq=merton+%22The+Sociology+of+Science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sometimes%20the%20discoveries%20are%20simultaneous%20or%20almost%20so%22&amp;f=false|year=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-52092-6|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others, described by A. Rupert Hall;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War'', New York, Cambridge University Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th-century discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others; and the [[theory of evolution|theory of the evolution]] of [[species]], independently advanced in the 19th century by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

Multiple independent discovery, however, is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research. Merton believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science", ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton"—a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], ''On Social Structure and Science'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is drawn between a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and an [[invention]], as discussed for example by [[Logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|Bolesław Prus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''O odkryciach i wynalazkach'' ([[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]):  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus], Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since the same phenomenon of [[multiple discovery|multiplicity]] occurs in relation to both discoveries and inventions, this article lists both multiple discoveries and multiple ''inventions''.

* [[Aristarchos of Samos]] (c. 310 – c. 230 BCE) was the first known originator of a [[Solar System|heliocentric (solar) system]].  Such a system was formulated again some 18 centuries later by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543).&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Gingerich]], "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?"

* [[Gresham's law|Gresham's (Copernicus') law]]: [[Nicole Oresme]] (c. 1370); [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1519);&lt;ref&gt;"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at [[Olsztyn]] in 1519.  He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at [[Grudziądz]]...  He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528."  Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gresham]] (16th century); [[Henry Dunning Macleod]] (1857).  Ancient references to the same concept include one in [[Aristophanes]]' comedy ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BCE), which compares bad politicians to bad coin (bad politicians and bad coin, respectively, drive good politicians and good coin out of circulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Αριστοφάνης|title=Βάτραχοι|url=http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/Βάτραχοι#v720|publisher=Βικιθήκη|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cosmic background radiation]] as a signature of the [[Big Bang]] was confirmed by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] of [[Bell Labs]].  Penzias and Wilson had been testing a very sensitive microwave detector when they noticed that their equipment was picking up a strange noise that was independent of the orientation (direction) of their instrument.  At first they thought the noise was generated due to pigeon droppings in the detector, but even after they removed the droppings the noise was still detected.  Meanwhile, at nearby [[Princeton University]] two physicists, [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] and [[Jim Peebles]], were working on a suggestion of [[George Gamow]]'s that the early universe had been hot and dense; they believed its hot glow could still be detected but would be so [[red shift|red-shifted]] that it would manifest as microwaves.  When [[Arno Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] learned about this, they realized that they had already detected the red-shifted microwaves and (to the disappointment of Dicke and Peebles) were awarded the 1978 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.&lt;ref name="Time, Bantam 1996, pp. 43-45" /&gt;

* The [[Wagner–Fischer algorithm]], in [[computer science]], was discovered and published at least six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Navarro | first1 = Gonzalo| doi = 10.1145/375360.375365 | title = A guided tour to approximate string matching | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 33| issue = 1| pages = 31–88| year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/126168/Navarro_Gonzalo_Guided_tour.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}}
* The [[affine scaling]] method for solving [[linear programming]] was discovered by Soviet mathematician I.I. Dikin in 1967. It went unnoticed in the West for two decades, until two groups of researchers in the U.S. reinvented it in 1985.
* [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]] was introduced by a Japanese biologist, [[Motoo Kimura]], in 1968, and independently by two American biologists, [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Hughes Jukes]], in 1969. 
* In 1970, [[Howard Temin]] and [[David Baltimore]] independently discovered [[reverse transcriptase]] enzymes.
* The [[Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm|Knuth–Morris–Pratt]] [[string searching algorithm]] was developed by [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Vaughan Pratt]] and independently by [[J. H. Morris]].
* The [[Cook–Levin theorem]] (also known as "Cook's theorem"), a result in [[computational complexity theory]], was proven independently by [[Stephen Cook]] (1971 in the U.S.) and by [[Leonid Levin]] (1973 in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]). Levin was not aware of Cook's achievement because of communication difficulties between East and West during the [[Cold War]]. The other way round, Levin's work was not widely known in the West until around 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Garey &amp; Johnson, ''Computers and intractability'', p. 119.&lt;br /&gt;Cf. also the survey article by Trakhtenbrot (see "External Links").&lt;br /&gt;Levin emigrated to the U.S. in 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mevastatin]] (compactin; ML-236B) was independently discovered by Akira Endo in Japan in a culture of ''Penicillium citrinium''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endo | first1 = Akira | last2 = Kuroda | first2 = M. | last3 = Tsujita | first3 = Y. | year = 1976 | title = ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium".

* The [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]], a harmonic, non-octave musical scale, was independently discovered by [[Heinz Bohlen]] (1972), [[Kees van Prooijen]] (1978) and [[John R. Pierce]] (1984).
* [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], an algorithm suitable for [[digital signature|signing]] and [[encryption]] in [[public-key cryptography]], was publicly described in 1977 by [[Ron Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]] and [[Leonard Adleman]]. An equivalent system had been described in 1973 in an internal document by [[Clifford Cocks]], a British mathematician working for the UK intelligence agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], but his work was not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.
* [[Asymptotic freedom]], which states that the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]] between [[quarks]] decreases with decreasing distance, was discovered in 1973 by [[David Gross]] and [[Frank Wilczek]], and by [[David Politzer]], and was published in the same edition of the journal ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Gross, F. Wilczek, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v30/i26/p1343_1'' Ultraviolet behavior of non-abeilan gauge theoreies''], Physical Review Letters 30 (1973) 1343–1346;

* The [[J/ψ meson]] was independently discovered by a group at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], headed by [[Burton Richter]], and by a group at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], headed by [[Samuel Ting]] of [[MIT]]. Both announced their discoveries on November 11, 1974. For their shared discovery, Richter and Ting shared the 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].
* [[Endorphins]] were discovered independently in Scotland and the US in 1975.
* 1975:  two English biologists, Robin Holliday and John Pugh, and an American biologist, Arthur Riggs, independently suggested that [[methylation]], a chemical modification of [[DNA]] that is heritable and can be induced by [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]al influences, including physical and emotional [[Stress (biology)|stress]]es, has an important part in controlling [[gene expression]].  This concept has become foundational for the field of [[epigenetics]], with its multifarious implications for physical and [[mental health]] and for sociopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Rosenfield]] and [[Edward Ziff]], "[[Epigenetics]]:  The [[Evolution]] Revolution", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 10 (7 June 2018), pp. 36,38.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quantum cryptography]]—the first [[cryptography|cryptographic method]] to rely not on mathematical complexity but on the laws of physics—was first postulated in 1984 by [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]], working together, and later independently, in 1991, by [[Artur Ekert]].  The earlier scheme has proven the more practical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Folger]], "The Quantum Hack:  Quantum computers will render today's cryptographic methods obsolete.  What happens then?" ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), pp. 50, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Comet Levy-Rudenko]] was discovered independently by [[David H. Levy]] on 13 November 1984 and the next evening by [[Michael Rudenko]].  (It was the first of 23 comets discovered by Levy, who is famous as the 1993 co-discoverer of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]], the first comet ever observed crashing into a planet, [[Jupiter]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[David H. Levy]], "My Life as a Comet Hunter:  The need to pass a French test, of all things, spurred half a century of cosmic sleuthing", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of [[elliptic curve]]s in [[cryptography]] ([[Elliptic curve cryptography]]) was suggested independently by [[Neal Koblitz]] and [[Victor S. Miller]] in 1985.
* The [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]], another fundamental result in computational complexity theory, was proven independently by [[Neil Immerman]] and [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html EATCS on the Gödel Prize 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804131454/https://www.eatcs.org/activities/awards/goedel1995.html |date=2007-08-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1989, [[Thomas R. Cech]] (Colorado) and [[Sidney Altman]] (Yale) won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[chemistry]] for their independent discovery in the 1980s of [[ribozyme]]s{{spaced ndash}}for the "discovery of catalytic properties of RNA"{{spaced ndash}}using different approaches. Catalytic RNA was an unexpected finding, something they were not looking for, and it required rigorous proof that there was no contaminating protein enzyme.
* In 1993, groups led by [[Donald S. Bethune]] at IBM and [[Sumio Iijima]] at NEC independently discovered [[Carbon nanotubes#Single-walled|single-wall]] [[carbon nanotubes]] and methods to produce them using transition-metal catalysts.
* [[Conductive polymers]]: Between 1963 and 1977, doped and oxidized highly conductive polyacetylene derivatives were independently discovered, "lost", and then rediscovered at least four times. The last rediscovery won the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry, for the "discovery and development of conductive polymers". This was without reference to the previous discoveries.

* In 2001 four different authors published different implementations of a [[distributed hash table]].
* [[Asymptotic freedom]] was rediscovered and described in 1973 by [[Frank Wilczek]] and [[David Gross]], and independently in the same year by [[David Politzer]].  All three shared the Nobel Prize in physics in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Terent'ev had discovered asymptotic freedom in [[quantum electrodynamics]] with charged vector field; and in 1969 [[Iosif Khriplovich]] had discovered asymptotic freedom in the [[SU(2)]] [[gauge theory]].  [[Gerardus 't Hooft]] in 1972 had also noted the effect but had not published it.)

* The 2006 [[Shaw Prize]] in Astronomy and the 2011 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] were both awarded to [[Saul Perlmutter]], [[Adam G. Riess]], and [[Brian P. Schmidt]]—working as members of two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]]—for the simultaneous 1998 discovery of the [[accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]] through observations of distant [[supernovae]].&lt;ref name="BibcodeApSSP"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992Ap&amp;SS.191..107P|doi = 10.1007/BF00644200|title=Inflation and compactification from Galaxy redshifts?|year=1992|last1=Paál|first1=G.|last2=Horváth|first2=I.|last3=Lukács|first3=B.|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=191|pages=107–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In regard to his "[[cosmological constant]]", "Einstein... blundered twice:  by introducing the cosmological constant for the wrong reason [to maintain a [[static universe]], before the advent of the [[Big Bang]] theory] and again by throwing it out instead of exploring its implications [including an [[accelerating universe]]]."

* In 2014, [[Paul Erdős]]' conjecture about [[prime gap]]s was proved by Kevin Ford, [[Ben Green (mathematician)|Ben Green]], [[Sergei Konyagin]], and [[Terence Tao]], working together, and independently by [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Large gaps between consecutive prime numbers|first1=Kevin|last1=Ford|first2=Ben|last2=Green|first3=Sergei|last3=Konyagin|first4=Terence|last4=Tao|date=19 August 2014|publisher=|arxiv=1408.4505|bibcode=2014arXiv1408.4505F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Large gaps between primes|first=James|last=Maynard|date=21 August 2014|arxiv=1408.5110|bibcode=2014arXiv1408.5110M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was shared by [[Takaaki Kajita]] of Japan and [[Arthur B. McDonald]] of Canada, who independently proved that [[neutrino]]s have [[mass]].&lt;ref name="NobelGuardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/06/kajita-and-mcdonald-win-nobel-physics-prize-for-work-on-neutrinos | title=Kajita and McDonald win Nobel physics prize for work on neutrinos | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=6 October 2015 | accessdate=6 October 2015 | author=Randerson, James and Ian Sample}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016 it was suggested that the anomalous [[acceleration]] effect on [[satellite]]s with [[RF power amplifier]]s that eventually led to [[EmDrive]] was actually observed by [[Roger Shawyer]] in 1997 and later explained by Dr. [[Mike McCulloch]], as well as a third researcher working for [[DARPA]] in the US. As this researcher has not yet come forward due to his research being [[Classified information|classified]], we may not know for sure.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">'''Literature-based discovery''' refers to the use of papers and other [[Academic publishing|academic publications]] (the "literature") to find new relationships between existing knowledge (the "discovery"). The technique was pioneered by [[Don R. Swanson]] in the 1980s and has since seen widespread use. 

Literature-based discovery does not generate new knowledge through laboratory experiments, as is customary for [[empirical]] sciences. Instead it seeks to connect existing knowledge from empirical results by bringing to light relationships that are implicated and "neglected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swanson | first1 = Don | year = 1988 | title = Migraine and Magnesium: Eleven Neglected Connections | url = | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 526–557 | doi=10.1353/pbm.1988.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marked by [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]] in concert or [[consilience]].

==Swanson linking==
[[File:Swanson linking.jpg|thumb|Swanson linking example diagram]]
''Swanson linking'' is a term proposed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Stegmann J, Grohmann G. Hypothesis generation guided by co-word clustering. Scientometrics. 2003;56:111–135. As quoted by Bekhuis&lt;/ref&gt; that refers to connecting two pieces of knowledge previously thought to be unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bekhuis|first=Tanja|title=Conceptual biology, hypothesis discovery, and text mining: Swanson's legacy|publisher=BioMed Central Ltd.|year=2006|pmc=1459187|pmid=16584552|doi=10.1186/1742-5581-3-2|volume=3|journal=Biomed Digit Libr|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it may be known that illness A is caused by chemical B, and that drug C is known to reduce the amount of chemical B in the body. However, because the respective articles were published separately from one another (called "disjoint data"), the relationship between illness A and drug C may be unknown. ''Swanson linking'' aims to find these relationships and report them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">'''Methodical culturalism''' is a philosophical approach developed by [[Peter Janich]] and his pupils. The core statement of this approach is that [[science]] is not developed from purely theoretical considerations, but as a development of  everyday, [[proto-scientific]] human behavior. That is to say, science is a stylized form of everyday knowledge-forming practice.

Thus, from the viewpoint of methodical culturalism, science is understood as a continuation of the practical processes of the everyday world and must be analyzed from this aspect systematically and methodically.

Methodical culturalism is a development of the [[methodical constructivism]] of the [[Erlanger school]] (known as "[[Erlanger constructivism]]").

A '''microbiologist''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μῑκρος}}) is a [[scientist]] who studies [[microscopic]] life forms and processes. This includes study of the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[fungi]], and some types of parasites and their vectors.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat&gt;{{cite web|title=What Microbiologists Do |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-2 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most microbiologists work in offices and/or research facilities, both in private [[biotechnology]] companies as well as in [[academia]]. Most microbiologists specialize in a given topic within [[microbiology]] such as [[bacteriology]], [[parasitology]], [[virology]], or [[immunology]].

[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], often considered to be the first [[list of microscopists|microscopist]] and microbiologist&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Lane|Lane, Nick]] (6 March 2015). "The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal'." ''Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci''. 2015 Apr; 370 (1666): 20140344. [doi:10.1098/rstb.2014.0344]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Duties ==
Microbiologists generally work in some way to increase scientific knowledge, or to utilize that knowledge in a way that improves outcomes in medicine or some industry. For many microbiologists, this work includes planning and conducting experimental research projects in some kind of [[laboratory]] setting.&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt; Others may have a more administrative role, supervising scientists and evaluating their results. Microbiologists working in the medical field, such as [[clinical microbiology|clinical microbiologists]], may see patients or patient samples and do various tests to detect [[pathogen|disease-causing organisms]].&lt;ref name=BLSwhat/&gt;

For microbiologists working in academia, duties include performing research in an academic laboratory, writing [[grant (money)|grant proposals]] to fund research, as well as some amount of teaching and designing courses.&lt;ref name=ASM&gt;{{cite web|title=Careers in Microbiology |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=https://www.asm.org/images/Membership/Careers_Website/Membership/Careers_in_Microbiology_PRINT_Letter_size.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbiologists in industry roles may have similar duties except research is performed in industrial labs in order to develop or improve commercial products and processes. Industry jobs may also include some degree of sales and marketing work, as well as regulatory compliance duties. Microbiologists working in government may have a variety of duties, including laboratory research, writing and advising, developing and reviewing regulatory processes, and overseeing grants offered to outside institutions.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Some microbiologists work in the field of [[patent law]], either with national patent offices or private law practices. Here duties include research and navigation of [[intellectual property]] regulations.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt; Clinical microbiologists tend to work in government or hospital laboratories where their duties include analyzing clinical specimens to detect microorganisms responsible for disease. Some microbiologists instead work in the field of [[science outreach]], where they develop programs and material to educate students and non-scientists and stimulate interest in the field of microbiology.&lt;ref name=ASM/&gt;

== Education ==
Entry-level microbiology jobs generally require at least a [[bachelor's degree]] in microbiology or a related field.&lt;ref name=BLShow&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Microbiologist |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-4 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These degree programs frequently include courses in [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], and [[genetics]], followed by more specialized courses in sub-fields of interest. Many of these courses have laboratory components to teach trainees basic and specialized laboratory skills.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

Higher-level and independent jobs generally require a [[Ph.D.]] as well as several years experience as a microbiologist. This often includes time spent as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] wherein one leads research projects and prepares to transition to an independent career. Postdoctoral researchers are often evaluated largely based on their record of published [[academic paper]]s, as well as recommendations from their supervisors and colleagues.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

In certain sub-fields of microbiology, [[license]]s or [[certification]]s are available or required in order to qualify for certain positions. This is true for clinical microbiologists, as well as those involved in food safety and some aspects of pharmaceutical/medical device development.&lt;ref name=BLShow/&gt;

== Job outlook ==
Microbiologists will continue to be needed to advance basic science knowledge and to contribute to development of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Outlook |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labaor |website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition |url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/microbiologists.htm#tab-6 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, job prospects vary widely by job and location.

In the United States, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] predicts that employment of microbiologists will grow 4 percent from 2014 (22,400 employed) to 2024 (23,200 employed). This represents slower growth than the average occupation, as well as slower growth than life scientists as a whole (6 percent projected).&lt;ref name=BLSoutlook/&gt;

'''Mississippi State Axion Search''' is the first of its kind light shining through the wall experiment designed to operate using a continuous [[radio wave]] emitter as the source of [[photons]]. The experiment contains a radio source and a set of detectors separated by a wall. The aim of the experiment is to limit the [[mass]] and [[coupling constant]]s of an [[axion]] like particle or a para photon by looking at the photons on the dark side of the tuned cavity. The experiment is projected to be completed by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/SES12/Event/181650 The Construction of Mississippi State Axion Search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://meeting.aps.org/Meeting/SES12/Event/181697 Preliminary Results from Mississippi State Axion Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a turn-key exhibit, now used in nature-based institutions around [[North America]]. Developed by [[Science North]] and [[AldrichPears Associates]], the Nature Exchange is an interactive forum where visitors trade ethically collected natural objects and information about them to learn and engage with the natural world. Visitors earn points for each trade, based on criteria such as quality, rarity and their knowledge of the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenorth.ca/enterprises/work/exhibits/natureexchange/index.html Nature Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science museum#Science_center|Science center]]s, nature centers and [[zoo]]s use Nature Exchanges to raise awareness of key issues in the natural world, and, through personal interaction, changes attitudes and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Naturhistorieselskabet''' - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in [[natural history]] in [[Denmark]] in the late 18th century. The spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and an escalating [[agriculture|agricultural]] crisis, led the [[List of Danish monarchs|king]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] elite to call foreign experts on [[economy]], including [[botany]] and [[silviculture]], to the country. The autonomous [[University of Copenhagen]], on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] based on private funds. For example, [[Martin Vahl]] lectured in [[botany]]. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in [[geology]] and in 1797 one in [[botany]], the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

==Goal==

The purposes of the standards include combatting ignorance of science, creating common standards for teaching in the U.S., and developing greater interest in science among students so that more of them choose to major in science and technology in college. Overall, the guidelines are intended to help students deeply understand core scientific concepts, to understand the scientific process of developing and testing ideas, and to have a greater ability to evaluate scientific evidence. Curricula based on the standards may cover fewer topics, but will go more deeply into specific topics, possibly using a case-study method and emphasizing critical thinking and primary investigation. Possible approaches to implementing the standards may even include replacing traditionally isolated high school courses such as biology and chemistry with a case-study approach that uses a more holistic method of teaching science to consider both (or more) topics within a single classroom structure.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many education supply companies have already started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers implement these new principles.&lt;ref name=MudWatt&gt;{{cite web |title=MudWatt NGSS Science Kit |url=http://www.mudwatt.com/pages/educational-resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Standards==
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are based on the "Framework K–12 Science Education" that was created by the National Research Council. They have three dimensions that are integrated in instruction at all levels. The first is core ideas, which consists of specific content and subject areas. The second is science and engineering practices. Students are expected not just to learn content but to understand the methods of scientists and engineers. The third is cross-cutting concepts: key underlying ideas that are common to a number of topics. The NGSS give equal emphasis to engineering design and to scientific inquiry. In addition, they are aligned with the [[Common Core State Standards]] by grade and level of difficulty. The standards describe "performance expectations" for students in the area of science and engineering. They define what students must be able to do in order to show competency.&lt;ref name=NGSS&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards: Executive Summary |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |date=June 2013 |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/ngss/files/Final%20Release%20NGSS%20Front%20Matter%20-%206.17.13%20Update_0.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important facet of the standards is that teaching of content is integrated with teaching the practices of scientists and engineers. This is a change from traditional teaching, which typically either dealt with these topics separately or didn't attempt to teach practices. According to NGSS, it is through the integration of content and practice "that science begins to make sense and allows students to apply the material."&lt;ref name=NGSS/&gt;

==Adoption==

Over 40 states have shown interest in the standards,&lt;ref name=NCSE/&gt; and as of November 2017, 19 states, along with the District of Columbia (D.C.), have adopted the standards: Arkansas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arkansas Adopts NGSS for grades K-8 |publisher=NSTA |date=June 17, 2015 |url=http://ngssblog.nsta.org/2015/06/17/arkansas-adopts-ngss-for-grades-k-8/ |accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, Connecticut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) were adopted by unanimous vote of the Connecticut State Board of Education| date=November 4, 2016 |url=http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/cwp/view.asp?a=2618&amp;q=320890|accessdate=December 11, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Delaware, Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liana |last=Heitin |title=Hawaii Adopts the Next Generation Science Standards|publisher=Education Week | date=February 17, 2016 |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2016/02/hawaii_adopts_the_next_generation_science_standards.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-TW|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the earlier roll-out of the Common Core (CC) math and English standards, states have no financial incentives from federal grants to adopt the Next Generation Science Standards. Previously, adoption of the CC standards was incentivized through states accepting federal grants during the 2009 TARP bailouts. Once states accepted the grant, they accepted the responsibility to adopt "college and career readiness" standards, which didn't have to be CC, but most states chose CC anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-williams/common-core-standards_b_3461006.html |accessdate =December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 26 states involved in developing the NGSS, called Lead State Partners, were Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead State Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/lead-state-partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the standards were released in April 2013, many states were expected to adopt them within one-to-two years. However, according to the ''New York Times'', it would take several more years to actually develop curricula based on the new guidelines, to train teachers in implementing them, and to revise standardized tests.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In addition, the pace of adoption is expected to be slower than was seen with the Common Core State Standards because, unlike Common Core, in which the states had financial incentives to adopt, there are no similar incentives for the NGSS.&lt;ref name=edweek/&gt; Many education supply companies have started offering NGSS-aligned products and resources to help teachers adopt NGSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Open NGSS Resources  |url=https://www.opened.com/search?standard_group=next-generation-science-standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

News reports have suggested there will likely be resistance towards the Next Generations Science Standards from conservatives due to the inclusion of [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=NCSE&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution and climate change in the NGSS |publisher=National Center for Science Education |url=http://ncse.com/news/2013/04/evolution-climate-change-ngss-0014800 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emily |last=Richmond |title=Students Would Learn about Climate Change Under New Teaching Guidelines |magazine=The Atlantic |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/students-would-learn-about-climate-change-under-new-teaching-guidelines/274858/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Teresa |last=Watanabe |title=New science standards call for teaching climate change and more |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 9, 2013 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-science-20130409,0,1524486.story |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Toppo |title=National science standards likely to raise 'ruckus' |newspaper=USA Today |date=April 10, 2013 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/09/science-school-standards/2064791/ |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Next Generation Science Standards |url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/partners |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the New Mexico Public Education Department initially attempted to make changes and deletions in the standards prior to adopting them. According to [[Skeptical Inquirer]], the "proposed changes would have deleted key terms and concepts such as evolution and the 4.6-billion-year age of the Earth. Specifically, 'evolution' would be called 'biological diversity,' the specific age of the Earth would be changed to 'geologic history,' and a 'rise in global temperatures' would be changed to 'temperature fluctuations.'" Following significant protests by the New Mexico Academy of Science, [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]], the Coalition for Excellence in Science and Engineering as well as scientists, educators, and faith leaders, the department announced in October 2017 that it would adopt the standards in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title=New Mexico Scientists, Teachers Stop Attempt to Taint Science Standards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Energy Modelling Initiative''' ('''openmod''') is a [[Grassroots|grass roots]] community of [[energy system]] modellers from universities and research institutes across Europe and elsewhere.  The initiative promotes the use of [[open-source software]] and [[open data]] in [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|modelling]] for research and policy advice.  The Open Energy Modelling Initiative documents a variety of open-source energy models and addresses practical and conceptual issues regarding their development and application.  The initiative runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]], an [[internet forum]], and a [[wiki]] and hosts occasional academic workshops.  A statement of aims is available.&lt;ref name="openmod-manifesto"/&gt;

== Context ==

The application of [[open-source software development|open-source development]] to energy modelling dates back to around 2010.  This section provides some background for the growing interest in open methods.

Just two active open energy modelling projects were cited in a 2011 paper: OSeMOSYS and TEMOA.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  Balmorel was also open at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
NEMO was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}
{{as of|November 2016}}, the openmod wiki lists 24 such undertakings.&lt;ref name="openmod-models-page"/&gt;

=== Academic literature ===

An innovative 2012 paper presents the case for using "open, publicly accessible software and data as well as [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to develop robust energy analysis tools".&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  The paper claims that these techniques can produce high-quality results and are particularly relevant for developing countries.

There is an increasing call for the energy models and [[dataset]]s used for [[energy policy]] analysis and advice to be made public in the interests of transparency and quality.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;  A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010b"/&gt;  One 2012 study argues that the [[source code]] and datasets used in such models should be placed under publicly accessible [[version control]] to enable third-parties to run and check specific models.&lt;ref name="DeCarolisEtal2012"/&gt;  Another 2014 study argues that the public trust needed to underpin a rapid transition in energy systems can only be built through the use of transparent open-source energy models.&lt;ref name="wiese-etal-2014"/&gt;  The UK TIMES project (UKTM) is open source, according to a 2014 presentation, because "energy modelling must be replicable and verifiable to be considered part of the scientific process" and because this fits with the "drive towards clarity and quality assurance in the provision of policy insights".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  In 2016, the [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) is seeking to improve its modelling methodologies, a key motivation being "the intertwined goals of transparency, communicability and policy credibility."&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"/&gt;{{rp|S27}}  A 2016 paper argues that model-based energy scenario studies, wishing to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a checklist of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors note however that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  An editorial from 2016 opines that closed energy models providing public policy support "are inconsistent with the open access movement [and] {{sic|public|ally|expected=publicly}} funded research".&lt;ref name="strachan-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;  Moreover:

{{quote|Given the importance of rapid global coordinated action on climate mitigation and the clear benefits of shared research efforts and transparently reproducible policy analysis, openness in energy research should not be for the sake of having some code or data available on a website, but as an initial step towards fundamentally better ways to both conduct our research and engage decision-makers with [our] models and the assumptions embedded within them.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}}}

A one-page opinion piece in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature News]]'' from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for scrutiny, currently only ''[[Energy Economics (journal)|Energy Economics]]'' makes this practice mandatory within the energy domain.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

=== Copyright and open energy data ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  Most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources, for example, [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  The doctrine of open data requires that these datasets be available under [[Copyright#Free licenses|free licenses]] (such as [[Creative Commons license|{{nowrap|CC BY 4.0}}]]) or be in the [[public domain]].  But most published energy datasets carry proprietary licenses, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped because the associated information is normally licensed to preclude downstream usage.  Recent transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"/&gt; and a 2016 amendment to the German Energy Industry Act{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="enwg-111d-2016"/&gt; to establish a nation energy information platform, slated to launch on 1{{nbsp}}July 2017.  Energy databases are protected under general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the copyright status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;

In December 2017, participants from the Open Energy Modelling Initiative and allied research communities made a written submission to the [[European Commission]] on the {{nowrap|re-use}} of [[public sector information]].&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"/&gt;  The document provides a comprehensive account of the data issues faced by researchers engaged in open energy system modeling and energy market analysis and quoted extensively from a German legal opinion.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;

=== Public policy support ===

In May 2016 the [[European Union]] announced that "all scientific articles in Europe must be freely accessible as of 2020".&lt;ref name="hendrikx-2016"/&gt;  This is a step in the right direction, but the new policy makes no mention of open software and its importance to the scientific process.&lt;ref name="albers-2016"/&gt;  In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source code]] policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] (DOE) is participating in the program.  The project is hosted on a dedicated website and subject to a three-year pilot.&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="code-gov-website"/&gt;  Open-source campaigners are using the initiative to advocate that European governments adopt similar practices.&lt;ref name="new-2016"/&gt;  In 2017 the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) issued a [[position paper]] calling for free software and open standards to be central to European science funding, including the flagship [[European Union|EU]] program [[Horizon 2020|Horizon{{nbsp}}2020]].  The position paper focuses on open data and open data processing and the question of open modeling is not traversed per{{nbsp}}se.&lt;ref name="gkotsopoulou-etal-2017"/&gt;

'''''PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story''''' is a [[book]] by Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]], published in 1991. The subject of the work is [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[phenethylamine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|chemical derivatives]], notably those that act as [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] and/or [[empathogen-entactogen]]s. The main title, PiHKAL, is an [[acronym]] that stands for "Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved".

The book is arranged into two parts, the first part being a fictionalized autobiography of the couple and the second part describing 179
different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including detailed synthesis instructions, [[bioassay]]s, dosages, and other commentary.

The second part was made freely available by Shulgin on [[Erowid]] while the first part is available only in the printed text. While the reactions described are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult-to-obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of [[Aluminium amalgam|mercury-aluminum amalgam]] (an unusual but easy to obtain [[reagent]]) as a [[reducing agent]] and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as [[safrole]].

== Impact and popularity ==

Through ''PIHKAL'' (and later ''[[TIHKAL]]''), Shulgin sought to ensure that his discoveries would escape the limits of professional research labs and find their way to the public, a goal consistent with his stated beliefs that [[psychedelic drug]]s can be valuable tools for self-exploration. The [[MDMA]] ("ecstasy") synthesis published in ''PIHKAL'' remains one of the most common [[clandestine chemistry|clandestine]] methods of its manufacture to this day. Many countries have banned the major substances for which this book gives directions for synthesis, such as [[2C-B]], [[2C-T-2]], and [[2C-T-7]]. In the United Kingdom, all but [[phenethylamine]] are illegal.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1994, two years after ''PIHKAL'' was published, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) raided Shulgin's lab and requested that he turn over his DEA license. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to ''PIHKAL'' "It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books," suggesting that the publication of ''PIHKAL'' and the termination of Shulgin's license may have been related.&lt;ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"&gt;{{cite news | author = Drake Bennett | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html | title = Dr. Ecstasy | work = New York Times Magazine | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = January 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable compounds ==
=== Essential amphetamines === &lt;!-- Note: a redirect, [[Essential amphetamines]], links to this subsection --&gt;

The "Essential Amphetamines" are what Shulgin describes as ten amphetamines that differ from natural products such as [[safrole]] or [[myristicin]] by an amine group ([http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal157.shtml ''PIHKAL'' Entry #157 TMA]). The list consists of:
* [[Paramethoxyamphetamine|PMA]] (''para''-'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[2,4-DMA]] (2,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-DMA]] (3,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] (3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3-Methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine|MMDA]] (3-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-3a]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-2]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA]] (3,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA-2]] (2,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA]] (2,5-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA-2]] (2,3-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Tetramethoxyamphetamine|TeMA]] (2,3,4,5-'''te'''tra'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)

Not all of these chemicals are bioassayed in ''PIHKAL'', some are merely mentioned.

=== Magical half-dozen ===

The so-called "magical half-dozen" refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of ''PIHKAL'', and are as follows:
* [[Mescaline]] (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine)
* [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), DOM being short for '''d'''es'''o'''xy '''m'''ethyl, referring to the removal of the Oxygen atom from the Methoxy group on the "4" carbon.
* [[2C-B]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''b'''romophenethylamine)
* [[2C-E]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''e'''thylphenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-2]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-7]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)

All six are now Schedule I controlled substances in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf|title=Controlled Substances|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|publisher=|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ravetz-Funtowicz-1988.jpg|thumb|Jerome Ravetz and Silvio Funtowicz, circa 1988, at Sheffield]]

'''Post-normal science''' ('''PNS''') represents a novel approach for the use of science on issues where "facts [are] uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent".&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; PNS was developed in the 1990s by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]].&lt;ref name="PNS1"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1991. "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues", in Costanza, R. (ed.), Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability: 137–152. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R., 1992. "Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science", in Krimsky, S. and Golding, D. (eds.), Social theories of risk: 251–273. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1993. "Science for the post-normal age", Futures, 31(7): 735-755.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as a reaction to the styles of analysis based on risk and cost-benefit analysis prevailing at that time, and as an embodiment of concepts of a new "critical science" developed in previous works by the same authors.&lt;ref name="UQSP"&gt;Funtowicz, S. and Ravetz, J., 1990. [[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK_1971"&gt;Ravetz, J. R., 1971. Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent work PNS is described as "the stage where we are today, where all the comfortable assumptions about science, its production and its use, are in question".&lt;ref name="no-nonsense"&gt;Ravetz, J.R., 2006, The [[No nonsense guide to science]], New Internationalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' introduced the concept of [[normal science]] as part of his theory that scientific knowledge progresses through socially constructed [[paradigm shift]]s, where normal science is what most scientists do all the time and what all scientists do most of the time. The process of a paradigm shift is essentially as follows:
* from normal science (the rules are agreed upon or disagreed upon in debates that cannot be concluded; science is puzzle solving, but some contradictions in theory cannot be resolved)
* to revolutionary science (important rules are called into question; contradictions may be resolved; paradigms shift)
* to new normal science (new rules are accepted, science returns to puzzle solving under new rules).

An illustration of the theory in practice is the [[Copernican revolution]], where Copernicus’ idea of a (sun-centered) solar system was largely ignored (not in the rules) when first introduced; then [[Galileo]] was deemed a heretic for supporting the idea (rules called into question); and finally, after a revolution in cosmology, the solar system became an obvious and foundational part of scientific knowledge (new rules).

Another example is the question of whether light is [[Wave–particle duality|a particle or a wave]]. For a long time there was debate on this point. Advocates on both sides had many valid arguments based on scientific evidence but were lacking a theory that would resolve the conflict. After a revolution in thinking, it was realized that both perspectives could be true.

Physicist and policy adviser [[James J. Kay]] described post-normal science as a process that recognizes the potential for gaps in knowledge and understanding that cannot be resolved in ways other than revolutionary science. He [http://www.jameskay.ca/pns/ argued] that (between revolutions) one should not necessarily attempt to resolve or dismiss contradictory perspectives of the world, whether they are based on science or not, but instead incorporate multiple viewpoints into the same problem-solving process. From the ecological perspective post-normal science can be situated in the context of 'crisis disciplines' – a term coined by the conservation biologist [[Michael E. Soulé]] to indicate approaches addressing fears, emerging in the seventies, that the world was on the verge of [[ecological collapse]]. In this respect Michael Egan&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;Egan, M., 2018, Survival Science: Crisis Disciplines and the Shock of the Environment in the 1970s, Centaurus 2018: doi:10.1111/1600-0498.12149.&lt;/ref&gt; defines PNS as a 'survival science'.

Moving from PNS [[Ziauddin Sardar]] developed the concept of [[Postnormal Times]] (PNT). Sardar was the editor of [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] when it published the article ‘Science for the post-normal age’&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt; presently the most cited paper of the journal . A recent review of academic literature conducted on the [[Web of Science]] and encompassing the topics of Futures studies, Foresight, Forecasting and Anticipation Practice &lt;ref name="Gauthier" /&gt; identifies the same paper as "the all-time publication that received the highest number of citations". 

==Content==
"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice".&lt;ref name="Personal"&gt;Funtowicz, S., 2016, personal correspondence.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled "Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis" &lt;ref name="ThreeTypes_1983"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. and Ravetz, J. R. (1985), Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis, in C. Whipple and V. T. Covello (Eds), Risk Analysis in the Private Sector, pp 217-232 (Plenum, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; This and subsequent works &lt;ref name="PNS1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PNS3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UQSP" /&gt; show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities.

The horizontal axis represents ‘Systems Uncertainties’ and the vertical one ‘Decision Stakes’. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's [[mantram]] with a fourfold challenge:  : ‘facts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’. For applied research science’s own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‘peer-reviewed’, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‘[[Metis (mythology)]]’).

==Complexity==  
There are important linkages between PNS and complexity science,&lt;ref name="Complexity"&gt;Rees, M., 2017, Black holes are simpler than forests and science has its limits, [https://aeon.co/amp/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits AEON, 01 December].&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. system ecology ([[C. S. Holling]]) and hierarchy theory ([[Arthur Koestler]]). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‘facts’ beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‘extended peer community’, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue.&lt;ref name="Poetry_Thermod"&gt;Funtowicz, S., and Ravetz, J.R., THE POETRY OF THERMODYNAMICS, Energy, entropy/exergy and quality, Futures, Vol. 29, No. 9. pp. 791-810, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended Peer Community==

PNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research.
The peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method &lt;ref name="Feyerabend1975"&gt;Feyerabend, P. (1975). Against method. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone &lt;ref name="Majone1989"&gt;Majone, G. (1989). Evidence, argument, and persuasion in the policy process. Yale University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; "In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making." The same author notes: "Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities. 

The lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology' &lt;ref name="Brown1997"&gt;Brown, P. (1997). Popular Epidemiology Revisited. Current Sociology, 45(3), 137–156.&lt;/ref&gt;, when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution &lt;ref name="Fjelland2016"&gt;Fjelland, R. (2016). When Laypeople are Right and Experts are Wrong: Lessons from Love Canal. International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry, 22(1), 105–125.&lt;/ref&gt; , and more recently ‘citizen science’ &lt;ref name="Stilgoe2009"&gt;Stilgoe, J. (2009). Citizen Scientists: Reconnecting Science with Civil Society. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt;. The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions &lt;ref name="Miedema2016"&gt;Miedema, F. (2016, May 12). To confront 21st century challenges, science must rethink its reward system | Science | The Guardian. The Guardian.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Thus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout &lt;ref name="Wynne1992"&gt;Wynne, B. (1992). Misunderstood misunderstanding: social identities and public uptake of science. Public Understanding of Science, 1, 281–304.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==


Beside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures'&lt;ref name="Gauthier"&gt; Thomas Gauthier, Sylvaine Mercuri Chapuis, 2018, An Investigation of Futures Studies Scholarly Literature, In: Poli R. (eds) Handbook of Anticipation. Springer, Cham &lt;/ref&gt;, PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‘conservation versus preservation debate’, especially via its reading by American pragmatist [https://www.iac.gatech.edu/people/faculty/norton Bryan G. Norton]. According to Jozef Keulartz &lt;ref name="Keulartz"&gt;Keulartz, J. (2018). Does Deliberation Promote Ecological Citizenship? The Convergence Hypothesis and the Reality of Polarization. In S. Sarkar &amp; B. A. Minteer (Eds.), A Sustainable Philosophy—The Work of Bryan Norton, The International Library of Environmental, Agricultural and Food Ethics 26. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; the PNS concept of "extended peer community" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists.

Other authors &lt;ref name="Heaslip"&gt;Heaslip, E., &amp; Fahy, F. (2018). Developing transdisciplinary approaches to community energy transitions: An island case study. Energy Research &amp; Social Science.&lt;/ref&gt; attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS.

Today Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values.

As summarized in a recent work "the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;Lister, A. R., Ingram, J. C., Briehl, M. M., &amp; Diana, S. (2018). THE BIOACCUMULATION OF URANIUM IN SHEEP HEART AND KIDNEY: THE IMPACT OF CONTAMINATED TRADITIONAL FOOD SOURCES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION. ProQuest, 10817030. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/openview/ab771b94df56ad747c9a64e499803e88/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including  "eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability".&lt;ref name="Gluckman"&gt;Gluckman, P., 2014, Policy: The art of science advice to government, Nature, 507, 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;
For Carrozza &lt;ref name="Carrozza"&gt;Carrozza, C. (2015). Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis. Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; PNS can be "framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’", and as a "reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople". For Mike Hulme (2007), writing on ''[[The Guardian]]'' Climate change seems falls into the category of issues which are best dealt with in the context of PNS and notes that "Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science".&lt;ref&gt;

Spash, p. 288-297.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been recently an increased reference to post-normal science, e.g. in [[Nature (journal)]].&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;Gluckman P. (2014) "Policy: The art of science advice to government". Nature, 507, 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grinnell2015"&gt;Grinnell, F.

==Criticism==
A criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997)&lt;ref name="PNS4"&gt;Weingart, P.  From "Finalization" to "Mode 2":  old wine in new bottles?.  Social Science Information 36 (4), 1997. Pp. 591-613.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called "finalization thesis".

== Special issues ==

The journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/futures FUTURES] devoted several specials issues to PNS.

* The first was in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/31/7 1999] and included as editorial two pieces: from [[Jerome Ravetz]] and [[Silvio Funtowicz]], [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials1.pdf Post-Normal Science—an insight now maturing], and from [[Jerome Ravetz]]: [http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Editorials2.pdf What is Post-Normal Science].
* The second [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00163287/43/2 special issue], edited by [[Merryl Wyn Davies]], was entitled "Post normal times" in 2011.&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;Davies, M.W., Editor, 2011, Special Issue: Postnormal Times
Futures, Volume 43, Issue 2, Pages 135-228 (March 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a selection of papers from the symposium "Post Normal Science – perspectives &amp; prospectives 26-27th June 2009, Oxford." A summary of the abstracts can be found on the [http://www.nusap.net/article.php?sid=48 NUSAP net].

* The third [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301921 special issue on PNS was in 2017]. This special issue contains a selection of papers discussed at the [[University of Bergen]]'s Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities between 2014 and 2016. The issue includes also two extended commentaries on the present crisis in science and the post-fact/post-truth discourse, one from Europe ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301969 Saltelli and Funtowicz]) and one from Japan ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301829 Tsukahara]). All articles in this special issue are in open access.

Another special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal [[Science, Technology &amp; Human Values]] in [http://nusap.net/article.php?sid=49 May 2011].

More titles and links relative to PNS special issues are available at the [http://nusap.net/article.php?sid=57 NUSAP net].

==Recent production==
A group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the quality control crisis of science.&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016. [[The Rightful Place of Science: Science on the Verge]]. The Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt; The volume discusses ''inter alia'' what this community perceive as the root causes of the present crisis.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Ravetz, J., 2016, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jun/08/how-should-we-treat-sciences-growing-pains How should we treat science's growing pains? The Guardian, June 8th 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative approaches== 
Among the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention [[NUSAP]] for numerical information, [[sensitivity auditing]] for indicators and mathematical modelling and [[MUSIASEM]] in the field of social metabolism.

==Mathematical modelling==
In relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‘models to predict and control the future’ are replaced by ‘models to map our ignorance about the future’, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model. &lt;ref name="Metaphor"&gt;Ravetz, J. R. Models as metaphors. in Public participation in sustainability science : a handbook (ed. B. Kasemir, J. Jäger, C. Jaeger, Gardner Matthew T., Clark William C.,  and W. A.) (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; PNS is also known for the its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate. &lt;ref name="OldPNSpaper"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., and Ravetz, J. R. 1990, Post-normal science: A new science for new times, Scientific European, October 1990, p. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practitioner Research''' refers to [[research]] and/or workplace research such as [[evaluation]] performed by individuals who also work in a professional field as opposed to being full-time academic researchers. Practitioner research developed as a recognized type of [[research]] in the last quarter of the 20th century. In this context, 'practitioner' means someone who delivers [[Public service|public services]], such as a nurse, teacher, advice worker, probation officer, counselor or social worker.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and evaluation for busy practitioners: a time-saving guide, p.1. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioner research developed in disciplinary silos,&lt;ref&gt;Molde S and Diers D (1985) Nurse practitioner research: selected literature review and research agenda. In Nursing Research 34(6) pp 362-367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell G and Colbeck B (1984) Whole school practitioner research: the Sunnyside Action Inquiry Project. In Educational Research 26(2) pp 88-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pieper M (1985) The future of social work research. In Social Work Research Abstracts 21(4) pp 3-11&lt;/ref&gt; but by the turn of the century it had been recognized that all disciplines could approach practitioner research in broadly the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson D (ed) (2000) The researcher's toolkit: the complete guide to practitioner research (Routledge Study Guides). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a practitioner, doing research alongside practice can assist with one or more of the following:
* Solving a specific problem, such as how to reduce crime on a particular housing estate.
* Contributing to the learning of a discipline such as education or social work.
* Influencing government policy, e.g. welfare or health policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson D (ed) (2000) The researcher's toolkit: the complete guide to practitioner research (Routledge Study Guides), p.2. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also held to improve the quality of the practitioner-researcher's practice.&lt;ref&gt;Fox M, Martin P and Green G (2007) Doing practitioner research, p. 88. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioner research has two categories:&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and evaluation for busy practitioners: a time-saving guide, p. 1. Bristol: The Policy Press&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Research in the workplace, such as a service [[evaluation]] or needs assessment,
* [[Research|Academic research]] related to the practitioner's role, such as a master's degree or PhD in a relevant subject.

The '''Registry of Research Data Repositories''' ('''re3data.org''') is an [[Open Science]] tool that offers researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers an overview of existing international [[data library|repositories]] for [[research data]].

== Background ==

re3data.org is a global registry of research data repositories from all academic disciplines. It provides an overview of existing research data repositories in order to help researchers to identify a suitable repository for their data and thus comply with requirements set out in data policies.&lt;ref name=Pampel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pampel|first=Heinz|author2=Vierkant, Paul |author3=Scholze, Frank |author4=Bertelmann, Roland |author5=Kindling, Maxi |title=Making Research Data Repositories Visible: The re3data.org Registry|journal=PLoS ONE|date=4 November 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78080|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078080|pmid=24223762|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078080|accessdate=7 February 2014|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878080P|pmc=3817176|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The registry was officially launched in May 2013.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sparceurope.org/registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched-re3data-org/ | title=Registry of Research Data Repositories launched – re3data.org | author=Wellander, Janna | date= 4 June 2013 | work=SPARC Europe | accessdate= 5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

In March 2014 the registry lists 634 research data repositories from around the world covering all academic disciplines. 586 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org – from Funding to Growing|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/re3data-org-from-funding-to-growing/|work=re3data.org|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project makes all metadata in the registry available for open use under the Creative Commons deed CC0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DataCite, re3data.org, and Databib Announce Collaboration|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/datacite-re3data-org-databib-collaboration/|work=re3data|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DRYAD entry in re3data.org 2014-03-21.png|thumb|A screenshot of the DataDryad entry in re3data.org.]]

== Features ==

The majority of the listed research data repositories are described in detail by a comprehensive schema, namely the re3data.org Schema for the Description of Research Data Repositories.&lt;ref name=Vierkant&gt;{{cite web|last=Vierkant|first=Paul|title=Schema for the description of research data repositories|work=GFZ Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam|accessdate=7 February 2014|author2=Spier, Shaked |author3=Rücknagel, Jessika |author4= et. al. |url=http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp?itemId=escidoc:301641|doi=10.2312/re3.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information icons support researchers to identify an adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their data.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenner|first=Martin|title=registry of research data repositories launched|url=http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/06/01/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/|work=PLOS Blog|publisher=Gobbledygook|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journal.pone.0078080.g001.png|thumb|Aspects of a Research Data Repository with the corresponding icons used in re3data.org.]]

== Inclusion criteria ==

A repository is indexed when the minimum requirements for inclusion in re3data.org are met: the repository has to be run by a legal entity, such as a sustainable institution (e.g. library, university) and clearly state access conditions to the data and repository as well as the terms of use. Additionally, an English [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) plus a focus on research [[data]] is needed.&lt;ref name=Vierkant /&gt;

== Partners and Cooperation ==

re3data.org is a joint project of the [[Berlin School of Library and Information Science]], the [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]] and the Library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT). The project is funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG).&lt;ref name=Pampel2013 /&gt;
The project cooperates with other Open Science initiatives like Databib,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kratz|first=John|title=Finding Disciplinary Data Repositories with DataBib and re3data|url=http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/03/03/finding-disciplinary-data-repositories-with-databib-and-re3data/|work=Data Pub|accessdate=21 March 2014|author2=Nicholls, Natsuko |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioSharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases|url=http://www.biosharing.org/biodbcore|work=biosharing|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DataCite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources|url=http://www.datacite.org/resources|work=DataCite|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095924/http://www.datacite.org/resources|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OpenAIRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org and OpenAIRE sign Memorandum of Understanding|url=https://www.openaire.eu/it/component/content/article/481-re3data-and-openaire-sign-memorandum-of-understanding|work=OpenAIRE|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several publishers, research institutions and funders refer to re3data.org in their Editorial Policies and guidelines as a tool for the identification of suitable data repositories, e.g. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The paper trail|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-paper-trail-1.13123|work=Nature|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SpringerPlus - Editorial policies|url=http://www.springerplus.com/about#editorialpolicies|work=SpringerPlus|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsch]],&lt;ref name=McDonald2005&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.physorg.com/news7971.html |title = Physicist Proposes New Way to Rank Scientific Output |accessdate = 13 May 2010 |author = McDonald, Kim |work =  |publisher = [[PhysOrg]] |date = 8 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the use of scholar indices has increased.

==Definition==
Sometimes called [[bibliometrics]], scholar indices are mathematical and statistical tools that measure the significance of the contributions made by an academic to their field of research. Scholar indices may incorporate other assessments such as citation tracking and journal ranking.

==Creation==
Any aggregator of [[citation]]s and references, could, given time, money and inclination, generate their own set of scholar indices. Publishers who are prominent in this field include [[Elsevier]] and [[Thomson Reuters]].

[[Commercial software]] which use [[parser]]s and web [[search engine]]s to generate sets of scholar indices or individual results are now available.  Examples are: ''[[Publish or Perish]]'';&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;Perish Software Harzing, A.W. (2007) Publish or Perish, available from http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  '[[ScholarIndex]]';&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/2007-10-09-h-index.html&lt;/ref&gt; '[[Scopus]]'&lt;ref name="Scopus"&gt;https://www.scopus.com/home.url&lt;/ref&gt; and '[[Google Scholar]]'.&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;https://scholar.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Each software vendor primarily uses its own data as well as journals, publications, authority files, indexes, and subject categories to produce sets of scholar indices.

While some companies provide the data and the evaluated metrics as free downloads, others require subscriptions to cover costs of manufacture and upkeep of an efficient parser, search engine and document database.

==Use==

Scholar indices allow choice of journal collections, application of research funds, ranking of journals and the determination of significant contributors in a subject area.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hamdaqa and A. Hamou-Lhadj, "Citation Analysis: An Approach for Facilitating the Understanding and the Analysis of Regulatory Compliance Documents", In Proc. of the 6th International Conference on Information Technology, Las Vegas, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of scholar indices recommend their use in areas such as liaison services, references, instruction and collection management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/englib/eld/conf/07/Werhane_H-index_poster_handout.pdf |title=The Hirsch index of scholarly output: New measure, ongoing debate |author=Amanda L. Werhane, UW-Madison |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the use of scholar indices cite their limitations due to issues of accuracy, validity and applicability and debate their application to hiring, tenure, funding, award giving and membership decisions.

Although scholar indices may not completely describe the impact of an individual researcher's work, some academics will determine their own scholar indices to include in promotional material and curriculum vita for example. Others may study their scholar indices simply for their own sake.

Those interested in the field of scholar indices may find the results, for example data visualisation projects, exciting.

==Types==
To date, a number of scholar indices have been developed. One is the 'h-index' introduced by [[Jorge E. Hirsch]] in August 2005. Hirsch described the h-index as unbiased as it involved the relationship of an academic's volume of published papers and the number of citations for those papers creating less bias than either measure alone.

Another scholar index is the 'g-index' which measures citation counts of all well cited works over a period of time. The 'm-quotient' was developed to introduce a time limit to the h-index which was otherwise, an ever-increasing quantity.

Other variants of the h-index such as hI-index, e-index &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = C-T | year = 2009 | title = The e-Index, Complementing the h-Index for Excess Citations | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5| page = e5429 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005429 | pmid=19415119 | pmc=2673580}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are being developed and reviewed.

The [[Erdős number]] &lt;ref&gt;Erdős Number Project. http://www.oakland.edu/enp/&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to measure the publication chain started by Paul Erdős.

All such scholar indices quantify the contribution of a researcher based on citations of their work only. Ideally, an assessment of a researcher's contribution to their field would include both scholar indices and an analysis of the quality of the work itself.

===h-index===
The [[h-index]] index was suggested by [[Jorge E. Hirsch]], a [[physicist]] at [[UCSD]], in 2005.&lt;ref name=McDonald2005 /&gt;

Henry Schaefer, of the [[University of Georgia]], US, together with colleague Amy Peterson, created rankings according to the h-index, from the ISI Web of Science. Though web-based applications can calculate h-indices, Peterson had to check for misspelt or duplicated names.

The h-index is defined as follows:

:A scientist has index h if h of his or her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other (N-h) papers have no more than h citations each.

To calculate the h-index, the papers written by an academic are arranged in decreasing order of number of citations. The h index is where the number of papers equals the number of citations (beginning with the paper with the highest number of citations).

Although widely used, the h index does not take into account the quality of the papers; other papers which cite the academics publications; the number of co-authors and the position of the author in the author list. Also, all fields are given equal value.

Another limitation is that the h index does not vary over time. For example, [[Évariste Galois]]  has an h index of 2 while [[Claude Shannon]] has an h index of 7 &lt;ref&gt;http://arnetminer.org/viewperson.do?aid=833230&amp;name=C.%20E.%20Shannon (Shannon h-index)&lt;/ref&gt;

===m-quotient===

While the h-index is independent of the date of an academic's career, the m-quotient aims at weighing the period of academic endeavour so that even junior scientists attain the importance that they deserve.

Thus, if ''n''=number of years since the first published paper of the scientist, the m-quotient=h-index/''n''.

However, the m-quotient may not stabilise until later in the scientist's career. for researchers in the early part of their career, who have low h indices,  small changes in the h-index can lead to large changes in the m-quotient. Hirsch suggests the researcher's first published paper may not always be the appropriate starting point, especially if it was a minor contribution that was published well before the academic's period of sustained productivity.

Although the m-quotient adds time as a weighting factor, it does not cater to the major disadvantages of the h-index including quality of publication and quality of citation.

===g-index===

[[g-index]] is a variant of the [[h-index]], which takes into account the citation evolution of the most cited papers over time.

:A set of papers has a [[g-index]] g if g is the highest rank such that the top g papers have, together, at least g^2 citations.

In other words, the [[g-index]] g is the largest rank (where papers are arranged in decreasing order of the number of citations they received) such that the first g papers have (together) at least g^2 citations. ''

It can be proved that for any set of papers [[g-index]] always exists and is unique.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite journal
|author= LEO EGGHE,
|title=Theory and practise of the g-index
|journal=Scientometrics
|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó, co-published with Springer Science+Business Media B.V., Formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers B.V.
|issue=69, number 1
|pages=131–152
|DOI=10.1007/s11192-006-0144-7
|volume=69
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g = \left(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha-2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}} \frac{1}{T^{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Lotkaian]] exponent and where T denotes the total number of sources.

Since  &lt;math&gt;h = T^{1/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = \left(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha-2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}} h &gt; h&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if 2 scientists have h-index 4, it may happen that one of them has published 4 papers which have 4  or more citations, while another scientist may have published 10 papers out of which 3 have more than 100 citations and the 4th paper has 4 citations, and the remaining have less than 4 citations.

In an attempt to offer a higher weighting to the second scientist who in aggregation has received greater than 304 citations for 10 papers, the [[g-index]] was proposed. Thus in our example, the first scientist has [[g-index]]=4, while the second scientist has [[g-index]] significantly higher.

===Erdős Number===

An Erdős number measures the collaborative distance between a person and mathematician Paul Erdős, measured by authorship of mathematical papers.

Considering Paul Erdős to have an index=0, people who co-authored with him have an index=1, co authors of those co-authors have index=2, and so on. Thus, to calculate one’s Erdős number, add 1 to the Erdős number of any co-author with the lowest Erdős, number. The Erdős-Number project at [[Oakland University]] maintains a website tracking the Erdős numbers of scientists world-wide.

One caveat is that most Erdős numbers recorded so far range up to 13, but the average is less than 5, and almost everyone with a finite Erdős number has a number less than 8.

===Hubs and Authority indices===

Evaluation of the complete contribution of a scholar to their field of research can be assessed in two ways. One is by accounting for the number of citations received by the scholar. The other is by accounting for the quality of the references referred to by the scholar.

While being strongly cited makes a scholar a strong authority in his field, having strong references makes a scholar a strong hub, who knows all the significant work in that field. Calculation of the hub and authority indices requires the knowledge of the relationships between scholars being cited or referred to.

The Hubs and Authorities algorithm can be used for computing these indices. The algorithm performs a [[link analysis]] on a given network and assigns two scores to each node: a hub and an authority.;&lt;ref&gt;Hubs and Authorities.http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/hubs-and-authorities-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubs and Authorities.http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vagelis/classes/CS172/publications/kleinberg98authoritative.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A valuable and informative node in a network is usually pointed to by a large number of links, that is, it has a large indegree (see Fig. 1). Such a node is called an authority.&lt;ref&gt;Background Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;

A node that points to many authority nodes is itself a useful resource and is called a hub. A hub usually has a large outdegree. In the context of literature citation, a hub is a review paper which cites many original papers, while an authority is an original seminal paper which is cited by many papers.&lt;ref&gt;Hierarchical Link Analysis for Ranking Web Data. http://renaud.delbru.fr/doc/pub/eswc2010-ding-slides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inout degree.png|thumb|Fig. 1. While considering the connectivity of the green node ''S'', the nodes ''y'' indicate the in-degree and nodes in ''x'' indicate the out-degree of node ''S''.]]

A network can be constructed of nodes representing authors and links indicating references to published papers. Outgoing links indicate who the author cited and incoming links indicate who cited the author.

A researcher's hub score is the sum of authors' scores whose work is cited. A researcher's authority score is the sum of authors' hub scores who referenced the researcher's work.

The hub score increases if the author cites papers published by authors with high authority scores. The authority score increases when published papers are cited by authors with high hubs score.

&lt;math&gt;h(x) \leftarrow \sum_{x \rightarrow y} a(y)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a(x) \leftarrow \sum_{y \rightarrow x} h(y)&lt;/math&gt;

The equations can be rewritten in a matrix-vector form. Let A be an adjacency matrix of the network and vectors h and a to contain all hubs and authorities scores, respectively. Then the scores can be calculated by the following formulas.&lt;ref&gt;HITS Algorithm - Hubs and Authorities on the Internet. http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{h} = (1/\lambda_h)AA^T\vec{h}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{a} = (1/\lambda_a)A^TA\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;

==Hubs and authority index algorithm implementation==
Hubs and authorities indices require the knowledge of the connectivity between scholars who refer and cite each other’s work. Since it is not always possible to accurately obtain these connectivity patterns, the adjacency matrix (A) regarding the scholar’s connections can be estimated.

For example, a scientist has an estimated local connectivity matrix. It is a combination of the work by which he is cited and works which he cites. Once the adjacency network is estimated, the hub and authority indices are determined by [[eigen-decomposition]] of ''(A.A’)'' and ''(A’.A)'' respectively. The steps followed for this specific implementation are as follows:
* Step 1: Let the scholar to be evaluated be ''S''. This scholar is searched in [[Scopus]] and the total number of citations he has received= ''c'', and the total number of references he has used=''r''.
* Step 2: A list of scholars who have cited the works of ''S'' are recorded as a set ''Y''. The list of scholars who have been referred by ''S'' are recorded as ''X''. The choice of members of ''X'' and ''Y'' are made in the order of decreasing citations in Scopus. Since an estimate of adjacency matrix ''A'' was sufficient, thus, we recorded members of ''X'', and ''Y'' with citations greater than 100 in Scopus. Let the number of significant citations = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''s'' &lt;/sub&gt;, and the number of significant references = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s'' &lt;/sub&gt;. For each significant member of ''X'' and ''Y'', one evaluates the ratio of (the number of citations/number of references) as weights of matrix ''A''.
* Step 3: Once the weights corresponding to the significant members of ''X'' and ''Y'' are calculated, the weights of not-so-significant members are estimated randomly. Thus, random weights are generated for ''c'' − ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''s'' &lt;/sub&gt; citations for members of ''Y'' and ''r'' − ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s'' &lt;/sub&gt; references for members of ''X''. The matrix ''A'' is thus generated as:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! A !! Column!! S !! X !! Y
|-
| Row index|| S || 0|| 1 || 0
|-
|  || X || 0 || 0|| 0
|-
|  || Y|| 1 || 0 || 0
|}

Where blocks of X and blocks of Y replace the ‘1’s. The connectivity follows the Fig 2.
[[File:Connectivity.png|thumb|Fig. 2. This image depicts the connections between ''S'', ''X'', ''Y'' for generating adjacency matrix ''A''. Only ''S'' is connected to ''X'' and ''Y'' is connected to ''S'', all other connections are 0. ''A'' is a unidirectional adjacency matrix.]]
* Step 4: The initial hub vector is calculated as primary [[eigen-vector]] (with the highest eigen-value) of ''A.A’'' and normalized between [0,1]. The initial authority vector is the primary eigen-vector of ''A’.A'' and normalized too. Since these indices are interrelated, thus, the hub vector becomes A*initial authority vector, and the authority vector becomes A’*initial hub vector. Since the scientist ‘S’ was the first entry of matrix A, hence the first value of the hub and authority vectors are the hub-authority indices for scientist S. The pseudocode for the same is as follows is ''S'' is a scholar whose hub index is ''h'' and authority index is ''a''.

=== Pseudo code ===
1     &lt;math&gt; h_i \leftarrow principal~eigen~vector(AA^T) &lt;/math&gt;

2     &lt;math&gt; a_i \leftarrow principal~eigen~vector(A^TA) &lt;/math&gt;

3     &lt;math&gt; h=A*a_i &lt;/math&gt;

4     &lt;math&gt; a=A^T*h_i &lt;/math&gt;

==Example 1: Scholar indices of well-known scientists==

{| class="wikitable"

|-

|-
| Einstein, Albert || 92 || 231 || N/A (nothing submitted after 1995) || 0 || 99.9586
|-

|-
| Pople, John || 87 || 293 || 29 || 123.7993 || 355.6553
|}

The table utilizes [[Scopus]] as a search engine only and the adjacency matrix is an estimation, thus the results tabulated above are extremely aggregated versions, and they must not be confused with absolute indices. A better estimate of adjacency matrix may produce variations in the indices. Also, Scopus keeps track of articles after 1995 only, so that is an additional constraint. (All the indices have been evaluated as of December 12, 2011.)

In this table, it is evident that different search engines yield different h-indices. It is possible that a scientist with high h-index may be a strong authority but not necessarily a strong hub. The validity of web-search engines is assessed as documents prior to 1995 are inaccessible. The number of publications of a particular author in a particular data base is responsible for affecting the hub-authority indices. Interdisciplinary work may be well assessed by the hub-authority index as opposed to other indices.

==Example 2: Projected hub-authority indices with time (Toy example)==

This is an example to understand the interplay of the various scholar indices.

A new scientist who began her academic career in 2009, has published 3 papers. Two papers have 2 citations each while the third  paper has no citations. She has referenced 60 papers with 17 strong references among the 60. One of her co-authors has the lowest Erdős number 3. Her scholar indices as per December 2011 are:
* [[h-index]]= 2
* [[g-index]]=2
* m-quotient= 2/2=1
* Erdős number=3+1=4
* HUB index (per 10^2)= 11.702
* AUTHORITY index=  0.1061

In another year, she publishes another paper with 20 new references such that now she has a cumulative of 31 strong references, 4 papers with 2 citations for 2 papers and 0 citations for other 2 papers. Her hub-authority indices change:

HUB index=12.668

AUTHORITY index= 0.1061

In another year, her citations for the 3 papers increases to 10 and she continues to have 60 references with 17 strong references:

HUB index=11.568

AUTHORITY index=0.3241

In another year, her citations increase to 10 and she writes another paper such that the number of references goes up to 80 (with 31 strong ones):

HUB index=12.694

AUTHORITY index=0.3284

Thus to summarize, the following hub-authority indices are observed for this toy example.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Instance !! No. of citations !! No. of references !! HUB (per 10^2) !! AUTHORITY
|-
| Currently || 4 || 60 || 11.702 || 0.1061
|-
| If references increase|| 4 || 80 || 12.668||0.1061
|-
|If citations increase || 10 || 60 || 11.568||0.3241
|-
| If citations and references increase || 10|| 80 || 12.694||0.3284
|}
The matlab code for the Example 1 and Toy example instances in Example 2 is attached as File 1.
[[File:Code.pdf|thumb|File 1. Sample MATLAB code for hub-authority indices for famous scientists and toy example in Example 1 and Example 2.]]

These examples demonstrate the importance of the hub-authority indices in quantitative evaluation of the contributions of a scholar in a complete academic career.

==Criticism==
Scholar indices have limitations including lack of accuracy, validity and applicability. While the accuracy of scholar indices is questionable owing to the difference in spellings, difference in parser, search engines and document data bases maintained by various online sources, it might be possible to solve the accuracy issues if each author could be assigned to a unique ID instead of relying on the names for searches. Also each time these indices are reported, the method and search engines used must be mentioned to avoid ambiguity as much as possible.

The validity of scholar indices is a limitation because they do not weigh fields of varying importance. For example, [[John Pople]], a theoretical chemist who has received a Nobel Prize, fares poorly in sets of h-indices.

Applicability of scholar indices has limitations when scholars emphasise practical advancement in an area of endeavour rather than the publishing of papers. It is also difficult to  document works of an earlier decade as online documents, thereby decreasing their online [[impact factor]]. For example, the [[Scopus]] is an online database that calculates scholar indices for documents found after 1995 only. Any earlier works are not documented or evaluated.

[[Jorge E. Hirsch]] suggested the [[h-index]] should inform hiring, promotion, funding, tenure, award and societal committees to make judicious decisions.  However, because of their limitations they are best viewed in a balanced way.

The '''School of Naturalists''' or the '''School of Yin-yang''' (陰陽家/阴阳家; ''Yīnyángjiā''; ''Yin-yang-chia''; "School of Yin-Yang") was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]].

==Overview==
[[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief.  This school was absorbed into the [[Chinese alchemy|alchemic]] and magical dimensions of [[Taoism]] as well as into the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical framework]]. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Ma Wang Dui]] texts and [[Huang Di Nei Jing]].

==Figures==
[[Zou Yan]] ({{zh|t=鄒衍}}; 305{{snd}}240 BC) was an ancient Chinese philosopher best known as the representative thinker of the [[Yin and Yang]] School (or School of Naturalists) during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era in [[Chinese philosophy]]. Zou Yan was a noted scholar of the [[Jixia Academy]] in the state of [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]]. [[Joseph Needham]], a British [[sinologist]], describes Zou as "The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought."{{cn|date=March 2018}} His teachings combined and systematized two current theories during the [[Warring States period]]: [[Yin-Yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements/Phases]] ([[wood (classical element)|wood]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[metal (classical element)|metal]], and [[water (classical element)|water]]).

During the Han dynasty, the concepts of the school were integrated into Confucian ideology, [[Zhang Cang]] (253-152 BCE) and [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179-104 BCE) being the chief instrumental figures behind this process.

The '''Science.ie''' portal provides all sorts of information about careers in [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM).

== Overview ==

Science.ie is an initiative of the Irish Government’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme in [[Ireland]].  DSE is managed by [[Forfás]] on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]].

The careers-related information on Science.ie has been moved to a new DSE website - [http://www.mysciencecareer.ie My Science Career] - which was launched in early October 2009. On MyScienceCareer.ie is:

*Profiles of people currently working in STEM in [[Ireland]] 
*Information on famous Irish scientists 
*Links to many other career resources

A redeveloped Science.ie was also launched in October 2009. The site has been redesigned and includes social media bookmarking and RSS feeds.

Science.ie provides more general information on science in [[Ireland]]. This includes listings of science links, news and events.

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the [[convection–diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i } \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of generalized momentum, there is the symmetry:

:&lt;math&gt; p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\quad \dot{p}_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i} &lt;/math&gt;

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

From the above, any equation of motion in classical mechanics can be derived.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

[[File:Newton portrait with apple tree.svg|thumb|right|[[Isaac newton#Apple incident|Isaac Newton and an apple tree]] form the popular, mythical account of his formulation of the theory of universal gravitation.]] 
A '''scientific myth'''  is a [[myth]] about [[science]].  For example, scientific discoveries are often presented in a mythological way with a theory being presented as a dramatic flash of insight by a heroic individual rather than as the result of sustained experiment and reasoning.  For example, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] is commonly presented as the result of an apple falling upon his head.  Newton's observation of an apple falling did indeed play a part in starting him thinking about the problem but it took him about twenty years to fully develop the theory and so the story of the apple has been described as a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Scott Berkun |date=27 August 2010 |title=The Myths of Innovation |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=4 |isbn=978-1-4493-8962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which this occurs and is problematic is debatable.  [[History of science|Scientific historian]] Douglas Allchin suggests that mythical accounts are misleading because they present the results as handed down by [[authority figure]]s and understate the importance of error and its resolution by the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Scientific myth-conceptions |author=Douglas Allchin |date=20 March 2003 |doi=10.1002/sce.10055 |journal=Science Education |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=329–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In responding to this, Westerlund and Fairbanks agreed that romantic accounts of science tend to distort its nature but, in the case of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s discovery of the rules of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]], they argue that Allchin's criticism of Mendel's role and reasoning is over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Gregor Mendel and "myth-conceptions" |doi=10.1002/sce.20007 |author=Julie Westerlund, Daniel Fairbanks |date=7 June 2004 |journal=Science Education |volume=88 |issue=5 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20007/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">'''Scientific teaching''' is a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach used in undergraduate science classrooms whereby teaching and learning is approached with the same rigor as science itself. 

According to a 2004 Policy Forum in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine, "scientific teaching involves active learning strategies to engage students in the process of science and teaching methods that have been systematically tested and shown to reach diverse students."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Diane Ebert-May, Robert Beichner, Peter Bruns, Amy Chang, Robert DeHaan, Jim Gentile, Sarah Lauffer, James Stewart, Shirley M. Tilghman, and William B. Wood. (2004). "[http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/documents/ScientificTeaching.pdf Scientific Teaching]." Science 304(5670, 23 April), 521-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 volume ''Scientific Teaching''&lt;ref&gt;Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund.  (2007). [http://scientificteaching.wisc.edu/books.htm ''Scientific Teaching''].  Madison, WI; Englewood, CO; and New York: The Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, Roberts &amp; Company, and W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  lists three major tenets of scientific teaching:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''Active learning''': A process in which students are actively engaged in learning.  It may include inquiry-based learning, cooperative learning, or student-centered learning.
*'''Assessment''': Tools for measuring progress toward and achievement of the learning goals.
*'''Diversity''':  The breadth of differences that make each student unique, each cohort of students unique, and each teaching experience unique.  Diversity includes everything in the classroom: the students, the instructors, the content, the teaching methods, and the context.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These elements should underlie educational and pedagogical decisions in the classroom. The "[[SCALE-UP]]" learning environment is an example of applying the scientific teaching approach.  In practice, scientific teaching employs a "backward design" approach.  The instructor first decides what the students should know and be able to do (learning goals), then determines what would be evidence of student achievement of the learning goals, then designs assessments to measure this achievement.  Finally, the instructor plans the learning activities, which should facilitate student learning through scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ebert-May and J. Hodder.

'''Screen media practice research''' is an emerging academic area situated primarily within university [[Media Studies]], Communications, Cultural Studies, Art and Design, and Performing Arts departments.  Conducted in the practical production of film, video, internet, visual arts, and similar media, it is a subsection of a wider body of [[practice research]] within the [[arts]] and [[humanities]].

==Definition==

The British [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]  has stated that "projects that can be defined as practice-led or applied"  are those "where creative practice is integral to the project or it is undertaken with the specific goal of producing a defined research output — for example, new or improved systems, designs, artefacts, exhibitions, performances, events, products, processes, materials, devices, services, films, compositions, broadcasts, policy guidance – that will be utilised beyond the research base."[http://www.ahrb.ac.uk/cpa/ongoing_funding_opportunities_for_post-doctoral_researchers.asp#sg]

In the UK, in Drama, Dance and the Performing Arts these issues have been the subject of an Arts and Humanities Research Board (now Council) -funded project at Bristol University.

According to [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/parip the Bristol University PARIP site], "practice as research (PAR) and practice-based research (PBR) — and 'research through practice', 'research by practice', 'performance as research' — are contested terms that resist close definition. Practice as research and practice-based research are frequently used interchangeably to suggest a relationship of research between theory and practice." [http://www.bris.ac.uk/parip/faq.htm#4]

==Dissemination and review==

Screen media practice research is disseminated in a variety of ways: at [[academic conference]]s (for example, the Joint Annual Conference of Media, Communications and Cultural Studies Association ([http://www.meccsa.org.uk/ MeCCSA]), now incorporating the Association of Media Practice Educators ([http://www.ampe.co.uk/ AMPE])); through [[academic publication]]; through relationships with cultural and [[creative industries]] (such as film festivals, broadcast, online communities, and creative partnerships).

In the UK there was a debate on whether submissions of practice research for peer review needed to be supported by a written statement evidencing the research, or whether the artefact could stand alone as research. According to the [http://www.ahrb.ac.uk/about/policy/response/the_rae_research_in_the_creative_performing_arts.asp AHRC Review of Research Assessment] (September 2003), there was need for a clearer articulation of the research process — including research methods, context and significance — in practice-led research that was submitted to the RAE in 2003.

The Arts and Humanities Research Council suggested that "practice-led research" should incorporate a scholarly apparatus that enabled other researchers to assess the value and significance of the results and that completed work should maintain a record or "route map" of the research process. Similarly the Communication, Cultural and Media Studies Panel [http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/overview Report] on the UK's Research Assessment Exercise for 2003 valued practice that could give "a reflexive account of itself as research", but found that many practitioners did not explain the ways in which the work constituted original investigation.

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
'''Sluggish schizophrenia''' or '''slow progressive schizophrenia''' ({{lang-ru|вялотеку́щая шизофрени́я}}, ''vyalotekushchaya shizofreniya''){{sfn|Jargin|2011}} was a diagnostic category used in [[Soviet Union]] to describe what they claimed was a form of [[schizophrenia]] characterized by a slowly progressive course; it was diagnosed even in a patient who showed no symptoms of schizophrenia or other [[psychotic disorder]]s, on the assumption that these symptoms would appear later.{{sfn|Sfera|2013}} It was developed in the 1960s by Soviet psychiatrist [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]] and his colleagues,{{sfn|Smulevich|1989}}{{sfn|Korolenko|Kensin|2002}} and was used exclusively in the [[USSR]] and several [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, until the [[fall of Communism]] starting in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|1986}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|Shafran|1986}}; {{harvnb|Gluzman|2013a}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Targum|Chaban|Mykhnyak|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis has long been discredited because of its scientific inadequacy and its use as a means of confining dissenters.{{sfn|Merskey|1988}} It has never been used or recognized outside of Soviet Union,{{sfn|Moran|2010}} or by international organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]].{{sfn|RIANovosti|2013}} It is considered a prime example of the [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]].{{Sfn|Arutyunov Henry|1987year.(Time of Perestroika)|p=}}

Sluggish schizophrenia was the most infamous of diagnoses used by Soviet psychiatrists, due to its usage against political [[dissident]]s.{{sfn|Robertson|Walter|2013|p=84}} After being discharged from a hospital, persons diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia were deprived of their civic rights, credibility and employability.{{sfn|Plante|2013|p=110}} The usage of this diagnosis has been internationally condemned.{{sfn|Gershman|1984}}

In the Russian version of the 10th revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] ([[ICD-10]]), which has long been used throughout present-day Russia, sluggish schizophrenia is no longer listed as a form of schizophrenia,{{sfn|Savenko|2008}} but it is still included as a [[schizotypal disorder]] in section F21 of chapter V.{{sfn|Russian adapted version of the ICD-10}}

According to Sergei Jargin, the same Russian term "vyalotekushchaya" for sluggish schizophrenia continues to be used and is now translated in English summaries of articles not as "sluggish" but as "slow progressive".{{sfn|Jargin|2011}}

==Development of theory==
In the 1960s, professor Andrei Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], developed a novel [[classification of mental disorders]] postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept were supported by Soviet psychiatrists Fedor Kondratev, Sergei Semyonov, and Yakov Frumkin.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=46}} All were members of the "Moscow school" of psychiatry.

A majority of experts believe that the concept was developed under instructions from the Soviet secret service [[KGB]] and the Communist Party.{{sfn|Voren|2010b}}

== Use against political dissidents ==
{{See also|Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
Psychiatric diagnoses such as sluggish schizophrenia were used in the USSR for political purposes;{{sfn|Katona|Robertson|2005|p=77}} the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia was most frequently used for [[Soviet dissident]]s.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} Sluggish schizophrenia as a diagnostic category was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system.{{sfn|Tobin|2013}} American psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]] points out that the term “sluggish schizophrenia” was created to justify involuntary treatment of political dissidents with drugs normally used for psychiatric patients.{{sfn|Breggin|1993}}

Critics implied that Snezhnevsky designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia (and this diagnosis) to make [[political dissent]] a mental illness.{{sfn|Stone|2002}}

[[St. Petersburg]] academic psychiatrist professor [[Yuri Nuller]] notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} Despite a number of its controversial premises, but in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis immediately acquired the status of dogma, which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} Snezhnevsky's concept, with its [[dogmatism]], proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}}

On the covert orders of the [[KGB]], thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet dissidents—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Healey|2011}} Snezhnevsky himself diagnosed, or was otherwise involved in, a series of famous dissident cases,{{sfn|Reich|1983}} and in dozens of cases he personally signed a commission decision on the legal insanity of dissidents who were in fact mentally healthy, including [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Leonid Plyushch]], [[:uk:Плахотнюк Микола Григорович|Mikola Plakhotnyuk]],{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}}  Revaz Korinteli, a professor of the [[Grigol Robakidze University]], says that Snezhnevsky broadened the borders of schizophrenia, and in this connection there was legal and theoretical justification for employing compulsory, involuntary treatment of dissenters in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Korinteli|2013}}

== Premises for using the diagnosis ==
According to the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] chief executive [[Robert van Voren]], the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the concept that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally ill (since there was no logical reason to oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world).&lt;ref name=Voren1&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|year2=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia furnished a framework for explaining this behavior.&lt;ref name=Voren1/&gt; This seemed to many Soviet psychiatrists a logical explanation for why someone would be willing to abandon his happiness, family, and career for a conviction so different from what most individuals seemed to believe.{{sfn|Voren|2010b}}

== Popularity of diagnosis ==
Because of diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia, Russia in 1974 had 5–7 cases of schizophrenia per 1,000 population, compared to 3–4 per 1,000 in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Gosden|2001|p=22}} In the 1980s, Russia had three times as many schizophrenic patients per capita as the USA, twice as many schizophrenic patients as [[West Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Japan]],{{sfn|Vasilenko|2004|p=33}} and more schizophrenic patients than any Western country.{{sfn|Vasilenko|2004|p=33}} The city with the highest diagnosed prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was [[Moscow]].{{sfn|Park|Park|Jun|Kim|2014}}

Along with [[paranoia]], sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Darrel Regier of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], one of the U.S. experts who visited Soviet psychiatric hospitals in 1989, testified that a "substantial number" of political dissenters had been recognized as mentally sick on the basis of such symptoms as "anti-Soviet thoughts" or "delusions of reformism".{{sfn|Moseley|1989}}

According to [[Moscow]] psychiatrist [[Alexander Danilin]], the [[Nosology|nosological]] approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Andrei Snezhnevsky (whom Danilin considered a state criminal) boiled down to the ability to diagnose schizophrenia.{{sfn|Danilin|2008}}

== Systematics by Snezhnevsky ==
The Soviet model of schizophrenia is based on the hypothesis that a fundamental characteristic (by which schizophrenia spectrum disorders are distinguished clinically) is its longitudinal course.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=543}} The hypothesis implies three main types of schizophrenia: 
*Continuous: unremitting, proceeding rapidly ("malignant") or slowly ("sluggish"), with a poor prognosis 
*Periodic (or recurrent): characterized by an acute attack, followed by full remission with little or no progression
*Mixed ({{lang-de|schubweise}}; in German, ''schub'' means "phase" or "attack"): mixture of continuous and periodic types which occurs periodically and is characterized by only partial remission.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=543}}

The classification of schizophrenia types attributed to Snezhnevsky{{sfn|Bleikher|1984|p=278}} is still used in Russia,{{sfn|Zharikov|Tyulpin|2000|p=371}} and considers sluggish schizophrenia an example of the continuous type.{{sfn|Tiganov|1999|p=414}} The prevalence of Snezhnevsky's theories has particularly led to a broadening of the boundaries of disease such that even the mildest behavioral change is interpreted as indication of mental disorder.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}}

=== Conditions posed as symptoms ===
A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of [[psychopathy]], [[hypochondria]], [[depersonalization]] or [[anxiety]] were central to it.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Symptoms considered part of the "negative axis" included [[pessimism]], poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia with few symptoms".{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} 
According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could [[Falsifiability|present as seemingly sane but manifest minimal (and clinically relevant) personality changes which could remain unnoticed by the untrained eye]].{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Patients with non-psychotic mental disorders (or who were not mentally ill) could be diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}
 
Harold Merskey and Bronislava Shafran write that many conditions which would probably be diagnosed elsewhere as hypochondriacal or personality disorders, anxiety disorders or depressive disorders appear liable to come under the banner of slowly progressive schizophrenia in Snezhnevsky's system.{{sfn|Merskey|Shafran|1986}}

The incidence of sluggish schizophrenia increased because, according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of socially functioning almost normally.&lt;ref name=Voren1/&gt; Their symptoms could resemble those of a neurosis or paranoia.&lt;ref name=Voren1/&gt; Patients with paranoid symptoms retained insight into their condition, but overestimated their significance and had grandiose ideas of reforming society.&lt;ref name=Voren1/&gt; Sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as "reform delusions", "perseverance" and "struggle for the truth".&lt;ref name=Voren1/&gt; As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reform delusion in every case where a patient "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an ideal of human happiness or other projects for the benefit of mankind".{{sfn|Styazhkin|1992|p=66}}

[[File:Marat Vartanyan.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Marat Vartanyan (1932–1993), a key apologist of Soviet psychiatric abuse,{{sfn|Voren|2010a|p=497}} the founder and former director of the Mental Health Research Center of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]]]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, theories which contained ideas about reforming society, struggling for the truth, and religious convictions were not considered delusional paranoid disorders in nearly any foreign classifications; however, Soviet psychiatry (for ideological reasons) considered critiques of the political system and proposals to reform it as delusional behavior.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=19}} The diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoid states with delusions of reform were used only in the [[Soviet Union]] and several [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European countries]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=18}}

An audience member at a lecture by [[Georgi Morozov]] on forensic psychiatry in the [[Serbsky Institute]] asked, “Tell us, Georgi Vasilevich, what is actually the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia?”{{sfn|Gluzman|2009}} Since the question was asked ironically Morozov replied ironically: “You know, dear colleagues, this is a very peculiar disease. There are not delusional disorders, there are not hallucinations, but there is schizophrenia!”{{sfn|Gluzman|2009}}

The two Soviet psychiatrists Marat Vartanyan and Andrei Mukhin in their interview to the Soviet newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' issued on 15 July 1987 explained how it was possible that a person might be mentally ill, while people surrounding him did not notice it, for example, in the case of "sluggish schizophrenia".&lt;ref name=Voren2&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010a|loc1=p. 492|year2=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was meant by saying that a person is mentally ill?&lt;ref name=Voren2/&gt; Marat Vartanyan said, "… When a person is obsessively occupied with something. If you discuss another subject with him, he is a normal person who is healthy, and who may be your superior in intelligence, knowledge and eloquence. But as soon as you mention his favourite subject, his pathological obsessions flare up wildly."&lt;ref name=Voren2/&gt; Vartanyan confirmed that hundreds of people with this diagnosis were hospitalized in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Voren2/&gt; According to Mukhin, it took place because "they disseminate their pathological reformist ideas among the masses."&lt;ref name=Voren2/&gt; A few months later the same newspaper listed "an exceptional interest in philosophical systems, religion and art" among symptoms of sluggish schizophrenia from a ''Manual on Psychiatry'' of Snezhnevsky's Moscow school.{{sfn|Voren|2010a|p=492}}

== Recognizing method, treatment and study ==
[[File:St Petersburg Psychiatric Hospital of Specialized Type with Intense Observation.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital of Prison Type of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs]] where [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], [[Alexander Yesenin-Volpin]] and [[Viktor Fainberg]] were imprisoned{{sfn|Fainberg|1975}} was one of the psychiatric hospitals of a special type used to "treat" litigiousness and reformism]]

Only specially instructed psychiatrists could recognize sluggish schizophrenia to indefinitely treat dissenters in a "Special Psychiatric Hospital" with heavy doses of antipsychotic medication.{{sfn|Plante|2013|p=110}} Convinced of the immortality of the totalitarian USSR, Soviet psychiatrists, especially in Moscow, did not hesitate to form "scientific" articles and defend dissertations by using the cases of dissidents.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} For example, Snezhnevsky diagnosed dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] as schizophrenic on 5 July 1962{{sfn|Popov|1992|p=70}} and on 12 November 1971 wrote to writer [[Viktor Nekrasov]] that the characteristics of Bukovsky's mental disease were included in the dissertation by Snezhnevsky's colleague.&lt;ref name=Snezhnevsky&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Snezhnevsky|year1=2012|loc1=p. 287|year2=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the paper products were available in medical libraries.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} As [[Semyon Gluzman]] recollects, when he returned to Kiev in 1982 after his absence of ten years, he was amazed to see all this "scientific" literature in open storage at the Kiev medical library and was even more amazed to read all the "ridiculous stuff" hardly put into scientific psychiatric terminology.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} In their papers and dissertations on treatment for litigiousness and reformism, Kosachyov and other Soviet psychiatrists recommended [[compulsory treatment]] for persons with litigiousness and reformism, in the same psychiatric hospitals used for murderers:{{sfn|UPA Herald|2013}} 
{{quote|Compulsory treatment in psychiatric hospitals of special type is to be recommended in cases of brutal murders committed on delusional grounds as well as in cases of persistent litigiousness and reformism with an inclination to induce surrounding persons and with a tendency to repetition of the illegal acts.}}

== Western criticism ==
Westerners first became aware of sluggish schizophrenia and its political uses in the mid-1970s, as a result of the high reported incidence of schizophrenia in the Russian population.{{sfn|Gosden|2001|p=22}} Snezhnevsky was personally attacked in the West as an example of psychiatric abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis that could be bent for political purposes. American psychiatrist [[Alan A. Stone]] stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry focused on Snezhnevsky personally because he was responsible for the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia for "reformism" and other such symptoms.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}}

== Recurrence in post-Soviet Russia ==
In 2010, [[Yuri Savenko]], the president of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]], warned that Professor Anatoly Smulevich, author of the monographs ''Problema Paranoyi'' (''The Problem of Paranoia'') (1972) and ''Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya'' (''Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia'') (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia, had again begun to play the same role. Under his influence, therapists have begun to widely use [[antidepressants]] and [[antipsychotics]] but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists. This situation has opened up a huge new market for [[pharmaceutical firms]], and the flow of the mentally ill to internists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}}

In their joint book ''Sociodinamicheskaya Psikhiatriya'' (''Sociodynamic Psychiatry''), Doctor of Medical Sciences professor of psychiatry [[Caesar Korolenko]] and Doctor of Psychological Sciences [[Nina Dmitrieva]] note that Smulevich's clinical description of sluggish schizophrenia is extremely elusive and includes almost all possible changes in mental status and conditions that occur in a person without psychopathology: euphoria, hyperactivity, unfounded optimism, irritability, explosiveness, sensitivity, inadequacy and emotional deficit, hysterical reactions with conversive and dissociative symptoms, infantilism, obsessive-phobic states and stubbornness.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=18}} At present, the hyperdiagnosis of schizophrenia becomes especially negative due to a large number of schizophreniform psychoses caused by the increasing popularity of various esoteric sects. They practice meditation, sensory deprivation, special exercises with rhythmic movements which directly stimulate the deep subconscious and, by doing so, lead to the development of psychoses with mainly reversible course.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=21}} Smulevich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2696084 | doi=10.1093/schbul/15.4.533 | volume=15 | issue=4 | title=Sluggish schizophrenia in the modern classification of mental illness | year=1989 | journal=Schizophr Bull | pages=533–9 | last1 = Smulevich | first1 = AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle.{{sfn|Smulevich|2009}} In his 2014 interview, Anatoly Smulevich says, "Now everything has slightly turned in a different way, sluggish schizophrenia has been transformed into schizotypal disorder, etc. I think it is not the end of his [Snezhnevsky's] teaching, because after a while, everything will get back into a rut, but it will not be a simple repetition but will get some new direction."{{sfn|Smulevich|Morozov|2014}}

In 2009, [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]], the then director of the [[Serbsky Center]], said to the [[BBC Russian Service]], "A diagnosis is now made only according to the international classification, so called [[ICD-10]]. In this classification, there is no sluggish schizophrenia, and therefore, even this diagnosis has not just been made for a long time."{{sfn|Fedenko|2009}} However, according to the 2012 interview by the president of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association Semyon Gluzman to [[Radio Liberty]], though the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia no longer exists in Ukraine, in Russia, as far as he knows, this diagnosis still exists, and was given to [[Mikhail Kosenko]], one of the accused in the [[Bolotnaya Square case]].{{sfn|Pavlova|Polyakovskaya|2012}} The prosecution's case for his forced hospitalization rested on confirmation of the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia{{sfn|RIANovosti|2013}} that he has been treated for over the last 12 years, until 2013 when the diagnosis was changed to that of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] by the Serbsky Center experts who examined Kosenko and convinced the court to send him for compulsory treatment to a psychiatric hospital.{{sfn|Davidoff|2013}} [[Zurab Kekelidze]] ([[:ru:Кекелидзе, Зураб Ильич|ru]]), who heads the Serbsky Center and is the chief psychiatrist of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation]],{{sfn|Safina|2011}} confirmed that Kosenko was diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Kekelidze|2013}}

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment.{{sfn|NPZ|2007}} In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in ''Psychiatry: National Manual''.{{sfn|Dmitrieva|Krasnov|Neznanov|2012|p=322}} In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform.{{sfn|Pashkovsky|2012}} As Russian sociologist [[Alexander Tarasov]] wrote, "you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as [[Anatoly Chubais]] or [[German Gref]] can be occupied with reforming in our country."{{sfn|Tarasov|2006|p=159}} According to Raimonds Krumgolds, a former member of the political party [[The Other Russia (party)|The Other Russia]], he was examined because of his "delusion of reformism", which gave rise to an assumption of slow progressive schizophrenia.{{sfn|Krumgold|2012}} In 2012, Tyuvina and Balabanova in their joint paper reported that they used [[sulpiride]] to treat slow progressive schizophrenia.{{sfn|Tyuvina|Balabanova|2012}}

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}

'''''Timaeus''''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ˈ|m|iː|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Τίμαιος|Timaios}}, {{IPA-grc|tǐːmai̯os|pron}}) is one of [[Plato#Dialogues|Plato's dialogues]], mostly in the form of a long monologue given by the title character [[Timaeus of Locri]], written c. 360 BC. The work puts forward speculation on the nature of the physical world and human beings and is followed by the dialogue ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''.

Participants in the [[dialogue]] include [[Socrates]], Timaeus, [[Hermocrates]], and [[Critias]]. Some scholars believe that it is not the Critias of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] who is appearing in this dialogue, but his grandfather, who is also named Critias.&lt;ref&gt;See Burnet, John (1913). ''Greek Philosophy, Part 1: Thales to Plato''. London: Macmillan, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, AE (1928). ''A commentary on Plato's Timaeus''. Oxford: Clarendon, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nails, Debra (2002). "Critias III," in ''The People of Plato''. Indianapolis: Hackett, pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that ''Timaeus'' was influenced by a book about [[Pythagoras]], written by [[Philolaus#Writings|Philolaus]].

==Introduction==
[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|left|[[Athanasius Kircher]]'s map of Atlantis from ''Mundus Subterraneus'' (1669) drawn with south at the top.]]
The dialogue takes place the day after Socrates described his ideal state. In Plato's works such a discussion occurs in the [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]. Socrates feels that his description of the ideal state wasn't sufficient for the purposes of entertainment and that "I would be glad to hear some account of it engaging in transactions with other states" (19b).

Hermocrates wishes to oblige Socrates and mentions that Critias knows just the account (20b) to do so. Critias proceeds to tell the story of [[Solon]]'s journey to Egypt where he hears the story of [[Atlantis]], and how Athens used to be an ideal state that subsequently waged war against Atlantis (25a). Critias believes that he is getting ahead of himself, and mentions that Timaeus will tell part of the account from the origin of the [[universe]] to man.

Critias also cites the Egyptian priest in [[Sais]] about long term factors on the fate of mankind:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, [[Phaethon]], the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt.  Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] (1817-1893) reproduced in, for example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTNctKDjxaMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Jowett+Timaeus+Phaethon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K1EwUt6bK-nC7Aa4zICgAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jowett%20Timaeus%20Phaethon&amp;f=false John Michael Greer, ''Atlantis'' (Llewelyn Worldwide 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-73870978-9}}), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The history of Atlantis is postponed to ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''. The main content of the dialogue, the exposition by Timaeus, follows.

==Synopsis of Timaeus' account==

===Nature of the physical world===

[[File:Raffael 067.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] is depicted in [[Raphael|Raphael's]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' anachronistically carrying a bound copy of ''Timaeus''.]]

Timaeus begins with a distinction between the physical world, and the [[eternity|eternal]] world. The physical one is the world which changes and perishes: therefore it is the object of opinion and unreasoned sensation. The eternal one never changes: therefore it is apprehended by reason (28a).

The speeches about the two worlds are conditioned by the different nature of their objects. Indeed, "a description of what is changeless, fixed and clearly intelligible will be changeless and fixed," (29b), while a description of what changes and is likely, will also change and be just likely. "As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief" (29c). Therefore, in a description of the physical world, one "should not look for anything more than a likely story" (29d).

Timaeus suggests that since nothing "becomes or changes" without cause, then the cause of the universe must be a [[demiurge]] or a god, a figure Timaeus refers to as the father and maker of the universe. And since the universe is fair, the [[demiurge]] must have looked to the eternal model to make it, and not to the perishable one (29a). Hence, using the eternal and perfect world of "[[Theory of forms|forms]]" or ideals as a template, he set about creating our world, which formerly only existed in a state of disorder.

===Purpose of the universe===
Timaeus continues with an explanation of the creation of the universe, which he ascribes to the handiwork of a divine craftsman. The demiurge, being good, wanted there to be as much good as was the world.  The [[demiurge]] is said to bring order out of substance by imitating an unchanging and eternal model (paradigm). The ''[[ananke]]'', often translated as 'necessity', was the only other co-existent element or presence in Plato's [[cosmogony]]. Later Platonists clarified that the eternal model existed in the mind of the Demiurge.

===Properties of the universe===

Timaeus describes the substance as a lack of homogeneity or balance, in which the [[Classical element|four elements]] ([[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[water (classical element)|water]]) were shapeless, mixed and in constant motion. Considering that order is favourable over disorder, the essential act of the creator was to bring order and clarity to this substance. Therefore, all the properties of the world are to be explained by the [[demiurge]]'s choice of what is fair and good; or, the idea of a dichotomy between good and [[evil]].

First of all, the world is a ''living creature''. Since the unintelligent creatures are in their appearance less fair than intelligent creatures, and since intelligence needs to be settled in a soul, the [[demiurge]] "put intelligence in soul, and soul in body" in order to make a living and intelligent whole. "Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of God" (30a-b).

Then, since the part is imperfect compared to the whole, the world had to be one and only. Therefore, the demiurge did not create several worlds, but a single unique world (31b). Additionally, because the demiurge wanted his creation to be a perfect imitation of the Eternal "One" (the source of all other emanations), there was no need to create more than one world.

The creator decided also to make the perceptible body of the universe by four elements, in order to render it ''proportioned''. Indeed, in addition to fire and earth, which make bodies visible and solid, a third element was required as a mean: "two things cannot be rightly put together without a third; there must be some bond of union between them". Moreover, since the world is not a surface but a solid, a fourth mean was needed to reach harmony: therefore, the creator placed water and air between fire and earth. "And for these reasons, and out of such elements which are in number four, the body of the world was created, and it was harmonised by proportion" (31-33).

As for the figure, the demiurge created the world in the geometric form of a ''globe''. Indeed, the round figure is the most perfect one, because it comprehends or averages all the other figures and it is the most omnimorphic of all figures: "he [the demiurge] considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike" (33b).

The creator assigned then to the world a rotatory or ''circular movement'', which is the "most appropriate to mind and intelligence" on account of its being the most uniform (34a).

Finally, he created the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|soul of the world]], placed that soul in the center of the world's body and diffused it in every direction. Having thus been created as a perfect, self-sufficient and intelligent being, the world is a ''god'' (34b).

===The Creation of the World Soul===
Timaeus then explains how the soul of the world was created (Plato's following discussion is obscure, and almost certainly intended to be read in light of the [[Sophist (dialogue)|''Sophist'']]). The demiurge combined three elements: two varieties of ''Sameness'' (one indivisible and another divisible), two varieties of ''Difference'' (again, one indivisible and another divisible), and two types of ''Being'' (or ''Existence,'' once more, one indivisible and another divisible). From this emerged three compound substances, intermediate (or mixed) Being, intermediate Sameness, and intermediate Difference. From this compound one final substance resulted, the World Soul.&lt;ref&gt;"The components from which he made the soul and the way in which he made it were as follows: In between the ''Being'' that is indivisible and always changeless, and the one that is divisible and comes to be in the corporeal realm, he mixed a third, intermediate form of being, derived from the other two. Similarly, he made a mixture of the ''Same,'' and then one of the ''Different,'' in between their indivisible and their corporeal, divisible counterparts. And he took the three mixtures and mixed them together to make a uniform mixture, forcing the Different, which was hard to mix, into conformity with the Same. Now when he had mixed these two with Being, and from the three had made a single mixture, he redivided the whole mixture into as many parts as his task required, each part remaining a mixture of the Same, the Different and Being." (35a-b), translation Donald J. Zeyl&lt;/ref&gt; He then divided following precise mathematical proportions, cutting the compound lengthways, fixed the resulting two bands in their middle, like in the letter [[Chi (letter)|Χ (chi)]], and connected them at their ends, to have two crossing circles. The demiurge imparted on them a circular movement on their axis: the outer circle was assigned Sameness and turned horizontally to the right, while the inner circle was assigned to Difference and turned diagonally and to the left (34c-36c).

The demiurge gave the primacy to the motion of Sameness and left it undivided; but he divided the motion of Difference in six parts, to have seven unequal circles. He prescribed these circles to move in opposite directions, three of them with equal speeds, the others with unequal speeds, but always in proportion. These circles are the orbits of the [[Geocentrism|heavenly bodies]]: the three moving at equal speeds are the Sun, Venus and Mercury, while the four moving at unequal speeds are the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (36c-d). The complicated pattern of these movements is bound to be repeated again after a period called a 'complete' or [[Platonic year|'perfect' year]] (39d).

Then, the demiurge connected the body and the soul of the universe: he diffused the soul from the center of the body to its extremities in every direction, allowing the invisible soul to envelop the visible body. The soul began to rotate and this was the beginning of its eternal and rational life (36e).

Therefore, having been composed by Sameness, Difference and Existence (their mean), and formed in right proportions, the soul declares the sameness or difference of every object it meets: when it is a sensible object, the inner circle of the Diverse transmit its movement to the soul, where opinions arise, but when it is an intellectual object, the circle of the Same turns perfectly round and true knowledge arises (37a-c).

===The Elements===
Timaeus claims that the minute particle of each element had a special [[Platonic solid|geometric shape]]: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).

[[File:Dodecahedron.gif|thumb|upright=0.56|[[Dodecahedron]] - [[Aether (classical element)|the fifth element]]]]
The ''Timaeus'' makes conjectures on the composition of the four elements which some [[ancient Greeks]] thought constituted the physical universe: earth, water, air, and fire.  Timaeus links each of these elements to a certain [[Platonic solid]]: the element of earth would be a [[cube]], of air an [[octahedron]], of water an [[icosahedron]], and of fire a [[tetrahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat.+Tim.+53c Plato, Timaeus, 53c]&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these perfect [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] would be in turn composed of triangular faces the [[Special right triangles#Angle-based|30-60-90]] and the 45-45-90 triangles. The faces of each element could be broken down into its component right-angled triangles, either isosceles or scalene, which could then be put together to form all of physical matter.  Particular characteristics of matter, such as water's capacity to extinguish fire, was then related to shape and size of the constituent triangles. The fifth element (i.e. Platonic solid) was the [[dodecahedron]], whose faces are not triangular, and which was taken to represent the shape of the Universe as a whole, possibly because of all the elements it most approximates a sphere, which Timaeus has already noted was the shape into which God had formed the Universe.

The extensive final part of the dialogue addresses the creation of humans, including the [[soul]], [[anatomy]], [[perception]], and [[transmigration of the soul]].

==Later influence==
[[File:Timaeus trans calcidius med manuscript.jpg|thumb|Medieval manuscript of Calcidius' Latin ''Timaeus'' translation.]]
The ''Timaeus'' was translated into Latin by [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;Cicero's version can be found at http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/cicero_timaeus.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the first part (to 53c) was again translated by [[Calcidius]] c. 321 AD. Calcidius' partial translation of the ''Timaeus'' was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few works of classical [[natural philosophy]], available to Latin readers in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Thus it had a strong influence on medieval [[Neoplatonic]] cosmology and was commented on particularly by 12th century Christian philosophers of the [[Chartres School]], such as [[Thierry of Chartres]] and [[William of Conches]], who, interpreting it in the light of the Christian faith, understood the dialogue to refer to a [[creatio ex nihilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stiefel, Tina | title=The Intellectual Revolution in Twelfth Century Europe | publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York | date=1985 | isbn=0-312-41892-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder''''' is a 1998 book by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author discusses the relationship between science and [[the arts]] from the perspective of a scientist.

Dawkins addresses the misperception that science and art are at odds. Driven by the responses to his books ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' wherein readers resented his naturalistic world view, seeing it as depriving life of meaning, Dawkins felt the need to explain that, as a scientist, he saw the world as full of [[Wonder (emotion)|wonder]]s and a source of pleasure. This pleasure was not in spite of, but rather because he does not assume as cause the inexplicable actions of a [[deity]] but rather the understandable laws of nature.

His starting point is [[John Keats]]' well-known, light-hearted accusation that [[Isaac Newton]] destroyed the poetry of the [[rainbow]] by 'reducing it to the prismatic colours.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins's agenda is to show the reader that science does not destroy, but rather discovers poetry in the patterns of nature.

==Summary==
===Preface===
It is of little concern whether or not science can prove that the ultimate fate of the [[cosmos]] lacks [[meaning of life|purpose]]: we live our lives regardless at a "human" level, according to ambitions and [[perception]]s which come more naturally. Therefore, science should not be feared as a sort of cosmological wet blanket. In fact, those in search of beauty or poetry in their [[cosmology]] need not turn to the [[paranormal]] or even necessarily restrict themselves to the mysterious: science itself, the business of unravelling mysteries, is beautiful and poetic.  (The rest of the preface sketches an outline of the book, makes acknowledgements, etc.)

===The anaesthetic of familiarity===

====Opening lines====
"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"

====Summary====
The first chapter describes several ways in which the universe appears beautiful and poetic when viewed scientifically.  However, it first introduces an additional reason to embrace science.  [[space-time|Time and space]] are vast, so the [[probability]] that the reader came to be alive here and now, as opposed to another time or place, was slim. More important, the probability that the reader came to be alive at all were even slimmer: the correct structure of [[atom]]s had to align in the universe.
Given how special these circumstances are, the "noble" thing to do is employ the allotted several decades of human life towards understanding that universe. Rather than simply feeling connected with nature, one should rise above this "[[anaesthetic]] of familiarity" and ''observe'' the universe scientifically.

===Drawing room of dukes===
This chapter describes a third reason to embrace science (the first two being beauty and duty): improving one's performance in [[the arts]]. Science is often presented publicly in a translated format, "dumbed down" to fit the language and existing ideas of non-scientists. This offers a disservice to the public, who are capable of appreciating the beauty of the universe as deeply as a scientist can. The successful communication of unadulterated science enhances, not confuses, the arts; after all, poets (Dawkins' synonym for artists—see page 24) and scientists are motivated by a similar spirit of wonder. We should therefore battle the [[stereotype]] that science is difficult, uncool, and not useful for the common person.

===Barcodes in the stars===
Studying a phenomenon, such as a flower, cannot detract from its beauty.
First, some scientists, such as [[Feynman]], are able to appreciate the [[aesthetics]] of the flower while engaged in their study. Second, the mysteries which science unfolds lead to new and more exciting mysteries; for example, [[botany]]'s findings might lead us to wonder about the workings of a [[fly]]'s [[consciousness]].
This effect of multiplying mysteries should satisfy even those who think that scientific understanding is at odds with [[aesthetics]], e.g. people who agree with Einstein that "the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious".
(For evidence, the rest of this chapter discusses the fascinating science and beautiful new mysteries which followed in the wake of Newton's "unweaving" of the rainbow, q.e. his explanation of the [[prism (optics)|prism]]atic effects of moist air.)

===Barcodes on the air===
This chapter offers more evidence that science is fun and poetic, by exploring [[sound wave]]s, [[bird vocalization|birdsong]], and low-[[frequency]] phenomena such as [[pendula]] and periodic [[mass extinction]]s.

===Barcodes at the bar===
A fourth reason to embrace science is that it can help deliver justice in a court of law, via [[DNA fingerprinting]] or even via simple statistical reasoning.
Everyone should learn the scientist's art of probability assessment, to make better decisions.

===Hoodwink'd with faery fancy===
This chapter explores what Dawkins considers to be fallacies in [[astrology]], religion, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial visitations]]. Credulity and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s criterion are also discussed.

===Unweaving the uncanny===
Amazing coincidences are much more common than we may think, and sometimes, when over-interpreted, they lead to faulty conclusions. [[Statistical significance test]]s can help determine which patterns are meaningful.

===Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance===
Unlike "magisterial poetry" (where metaphors and pretty language are used to describe the familiar), "pupillary poetry" uses poetic imagery to assist a scientist's thinking about the exotic (e.g. consider "being" an [[electron]] temporarily). Although it is useful, some authors take pupillary poetry too far, and, "[[drunk]] on metaphor", they produce "bad science"; i.e. postulate faulty theories. This is powered by humanity's natural tendency to look for representations.

===The selfish cooperator===
[[Gene]]s compete with each other, but this occurs within the context of collaboration, as is shown with examples involving [[mitochondria]], bacteria, and [[termite]]s. Two types of collaboration are co-adaptation (tailoring simultaneously the different parts of an organism, such as flower colour and flower markings), and co-evolution (two species changing together; e.g. [[predator]] and [[prey]] running speeds may increase together in a sort of [[arms race]]).

===The genetic Book of the Dead===
The body of any organism provides clues about its [[habitat]]. The genes allow one to reconstruct a picture of the range of ways of life that the species has experienced; in this sense DNA would act as a [[palimpsest]]ic "[[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]" if only its language of encoding history could be fully understood. Finally, the curious genetics of [[cuckoo]]s is discussed.

===Reweaving the world===
The brain is akin to a powerful computer, which creates a sort of [[virtual reality]] to model economically the environment. [[Neural]] [[circuitry]] is discussed, and a comparison is made between brains and genes: albeit over different time scales, both record the environment's past to help the [[organism]] make the optimal actions in the (predicted) future.

===The balloon of the mind===
The simultaneous explosions in [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software of the 20th century are together an example of what Dawkins calls "self-feeding co-evolution".
A similar event occurred over a longer time scale (millions of years) when the minds and brains of our ancestors simultaneously improved very rapidly. Five possible triggers of this improvement were: language, map reading, [[ballistics]], [[meme]]s, and [[metaphor]]s/[[analogies]].

====Conclusion====
The final two paragraphs of ''The balloon of the mind'' conclude by saying that human beings are the only animal with a sense of purpose in life, and that that purpose should be to construct a comprehensive [[Scientific modelling|model]] of how the universe works.

==Petwhac==

The book coins an [[acronym]]ical term, ''Petwhac'' ''(Population of Events That Would Have Appeared Coincidental)''. This is defined as all those events that may be considered to be a 'coincidence' if studied casually, but are both possible and statistically probable.

A way to get an idea of how to use the petwhac is as follows. Say you see a friend from school you have not seen for years when you are on holiday (an unlikely event); before saying it is fate or coincidence, think what is in the petwhac (meeting any friend from the same time period at least, friends of your brothers, sisters or parents, old flames, neighbours, teachers, someone who worked in the local chip-shop... the list is probably endless, and all would seem coincidental). In short: the bigger the petwhac, the stronger case you have to avoid ascribing something to [[destiny|fate]] or coincidence.

Dawkins offers several examples of petwhacs in the book, two of which are the bedside clock of a woman ([[Richard Feynman]]'s wife) stopping exactly when she died, and a psychic who stops the watches of his television audience.

The first is explained by the fact that the clock had a mechanical defect which made it stop when tilted off the horizontal, which is what a nurse did to read the time of death in poor lighting conditions. The matter of the watches, in Dawkins' own words, is explained thus —

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If somebody's watch stopped three weeks after the spell was cast, even the most credulous would prefer to put it down to chance. We need to decide how large a delay would have been judged by the audience as sufficiently simultaneous with the psychic's announcement to impress. About five minutes is certainly safe, especially since he can keep talking to each caller for a few minutes before the next call ceases to seem roughly simultaneous. There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The probability that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated five-minute period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10 million people watching the show. If only half of them are wearing watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to stop in any given minute. If only a quarter of these ring into the studio, that is 6 calls, more than enough to dumbfound a naïve audience. Especially when you add in the calls from people whose watches stopped the day before, people whose watches didn't stop but whose grandfather clocks did, people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved relatives phoned in to say that their 'ticker' gave out, and so on.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dawkins defends his choice of the word "population" by writing "Population may seem an odd word, but it is the correct statistical term.", adding "I won't keep using capital letters because they stand so unattractively on the page."

A '''violation paradigm''' is a [[scientific method]] where the [[scientist]] perturbs an expected [[Design of experiments|factor]] to look at the subject's following [[reflex|reactions]]. These reactions are believed to be relevant to the [[process]] studied. For example, creating wrong word segmentations in a text will [[Destabilisation|destabilize]] the reader. This warns the [[researcher]] that the respondent's [[brain]] considers the characters are united into words, and not just as a succession of given sets of letters. The process was originally developed by Danks, Bohn &amp; Fear (1983), and proved valid ({{harvnb|Chen|1999|p= }}).

'''''Wolfstein, The Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber’s Cave''''' is an 1850 [[chapbook]] based on [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]’s 1811 Gothic horror novel ''[[St. Irvyne;  or, The Rosicrucian]]''.[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Title page.jpg|thumb|Title page.]]

==Background==

The 1811 novel ''St. Irvyne, or, The Rosicrucian'' was republished by [[John Joseph Stockdale]] in 1822 following Shelley’s death. Two chapbooks were also published based on the novel. No publication date appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gothicbibliograp00summ#page/n627/mode/2up Summers, Montague. ''A Gothic Bibliography.'' London: The Fortune Press, 1940, p. 561. No date of publication. Circa 1800. No author.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first chapbook version was entitled ''[[Wolfstein (Percy Bysshe Shelley chapbook)|Wolfstein; or, The Mysterious Bandit]]'' and was published and printed by John Bailey at 116, Chancery Lane in London in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein.html?id=JRoBHQAACAAJ ''Wolfstein; Or, The Mysterious Bandit.''

Chapbooks were meant for popular consumption, serving the same function as a paperback would. The chapbook sold for sixpence.

Another more condensed twelve-page chapbook was published in 1850 by Thomas Redriffe in London entitled ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance. To which is Added, The Two Serpents, an Oriental Apologue.'' The Ossian epigraph appeared on the title page: "A tale of horror, of murder, and of deeds done in darkness." Printed for Thomas Redriffe, Piccadilly. The price was "Two Pence".  Printed by William Bethell, 10, Marshall-street, Liverpool. No date of publication appeared on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Wolfstein_the_Murderer_Or_The_Secrets_of.html?id=OZhmngEACAAJ ''Wolfstein, the Murderer; Or, The Secrets of a Robber's Cave: A Terrific Romance.

Bodleian Library. University of Oxford.]&lt;/ref&gt; The story was six pages long, pages three through eight. The second story was four pages long, pages nine through twelve.

The frontispiece consisted of a drawing of Wolfstein confronted by a skeleton struck by lightning. He stands over the corpse of Serena. The drawing is a more condensed version of the 1822 frontispiece. The caption reads: "Deeper grew the gloom of the cavern, and darkness seemed to press around him. Suddenly a flash of lightning burst through the cavern, followed by thunder that appeared to convulse the universal fabric of nature; and borne on the sulphurous blast, the Prince of Terrors stood before him."

==Plot Summary==
[[File:Wolfstein, the Murderer Frontispiece.jpg|left|thumb|Frontispiece.]]The chapbook follows the plot of the first section of the novel ''St. Irvyne'' on the bandits but omits the second part featuring Frederic Nempere in Geneva. The account is radically condensed.
The name of Cavigni, leader of the bandits, is changed to Stiletto. The name of Megalena is changed to Serena. The character of Ginotti, the Rosicrucian alchemist, does not appear.

The opening scene is of a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a distraught outcast who plans to commit suicide. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life.

Bandits then attack them. Wolfstein is accepted as a member of the bandits. He becomes used to a life of crime. But a rivalry develops between him and Stilleto over Serena. He decides to poison the chief by secretly placing a white powder in his wine. Stiletto drinks the poison and dies.

Wolfstein is subsequently elected Captain by the other bandits after the murder of Stiletto. He then is racked by dreams of the murdered Cavigni which fill him with dread and foreboding.
Days after the murder, Wolfstein seeks to seduce Serena. He observes her in prayer. She refuses his advances and pulls out a dagger. In response, Wolfstein unsheaths his sword and stabs her to death.

Thunder was heard in the cell. The Prince of Terror then appeared before him. A “strange and unnatural stench” infused the room as “the yawning gulf of hell” swallowed Wolfstein as blue flames swirled around his body.

The final paragraph concludes with a moral of the story. Plunging into despair and indulging in crime are not the ways to confront misfortune. The tenets of morality and truth should be diligently followed. Only “misery, disgrace and ruin” result when these principles are ignored.
