'''Astrolinguistics''' is a field of [[linguistics]] connected with the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).

== Early Soviet experiments ==

Arguably the first attempt to construct a language for interplanetary communication was made by the anarchist philosopher Wolf Gordin (brother of [[Abba Gordin]]) in his books ''Grammar of the Language of the Mankind AO'' (1920) and ''Grammar of the Language AO'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumka.be/sites/default/files/files/files/volf_gordin_-_grammatika_yazyka_ao_-_1923.pdf Wolf Gordin. Grammar of the Language AO (1923) (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ''AO'' language was presented at the First international exhibition of interplanetary machines and mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of [[Tsiolkovsky]]) in Moscow, 1927 as a language for interplanetary travels&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Smith. Rockets and Revolution: A Cultural History of Early Spaceflight. University of Nebraska Press, 2014. P. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-"fetishizing", non-"sociomorphic", non-gender based and non-[[Class discrimination|classist]]. The design of the language was inspired by the [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futuristic poetry]], brothers Gordins' pan-anarchist philosophy and early Tsiolkovsky's remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with later Freudenthal's insights)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1995_num_17_2_2419 Kuznecov S. Linguistica cosmica: La naissance du paradigme cosmique // Une familière étrangeté: La linguistique russe et soviétique. Paris, 1995 (Histoire Épistémologie Langage. 17/11 (Tome XVII - fascicule 2)), p. 211-234.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Freudenthal's LINCOS==
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
An integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician [[Hans Freudenthal]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], in 1960 – around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book ''[[Lincos (artificial language)|LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse]]'' seems at first sight non-linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language.  The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (''Homo sapiens''), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: “LINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephimeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing”.

==Ollongren's LINCOS==
The concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph  ''Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic'', written by the astronomer and computer scientist [[Alexander Ollongren]], [[University of Leiden]], The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic – which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense). Kadri Tinn's (Astronomy for Humans) review of Ollongren's book recognised that aspect – she wrote:

{{Quote|Astrolinguistics is the study of interstellar languages and possibility of communication using an artificially created language that is self-contained and wouldn't include some of the aspects of natural languages. … new Lingua Cosmica is a language system based on applied logic, the understanding of which might be expected from a civilization that has developed technology advanced enough to receive radio emissions.}}

'''''Babel-17''''' is a 1966 [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Samuel R. Delany]] in which the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] (that language influences thought and perception) plays an important part. It was joint winner of the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1967 (with ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'')&lt;ref name="WWE-1966"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="WWE-1967"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany hoped to have ''Babel-17'' originally published as a single volume with the novella ''[[Empire Star]]'', but this did not happen until a 2001 reprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delany|first1=Samuel R.|title=Babel-17 / Empire Star|date=December 2001|publisher=Vintage Books / Random House|isbn=0-375-70669-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

During an interstellar war one side develops a language, ''Babel-17'', that can be used as a weapon.  Learning it turns one into an unwilling traitor as it alters perception and thought. The change is made more dangerous by the language's seductive enhancement of other abilities.  This is discovered by the beautiful star-ship captain, linguist, poet, and telepath Rydra Wong. She is recruited by her government to discover how the enemy are infiltrating and sabotaging strategic sites. Initially Babel-17 is thought to be a code used by enemy agents. Rydra Wong realizes it is a language and during her journey, has a traitor on the ship. Rydra later finds herself becoming the traitor as she learns more about Babel-17.  She is rescued by her dedicated crew, figures out the danger, and neutralizes its effects.

The novel deals with several issues related to the peculiarities of language, how conditions of life shape the formation of words and meaning, and how the words themselves can shape the actions of people.

==Language==
The language portrayed at the center of ''Babel-17'' contains interesting linguistic features including the absence of a pronoun or any other construction for "I". The heroine finds her perceptions (and even her physical abilities) altered once she has learned Babel-17. In this Delany's novel influenced a generation of writers: ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, ''[[Embassytown]]'' by [[China Miéville]], "In Luna Bore Coda" by Joshua Nilles, and, more evidently, the short story "[[Story of Your Life]]" by [[Ted Chiang]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. It also resembles a few preceding science fiction novels which deal with how languages shape the political and cultural stratum of societies, such as ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'' by [[Jack Vance]] or ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' by [[Ayn Rand]], and language as a weapon was adapted as a plot device in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]''.

==Other media==
In 2014, the work ''Babel-17'' was told in tandem with a partial biography of Samuel R. Delany's early years in the form of a play ''The Motion of Light in Water'', based on a 1988 autobiography with the same title, produced by Elbow Room, an Australian theatre company directed by Marcel Dorney.

'''Balaibalan''' ({{lang-tr|'''Bâleybelen'''}}), also transcribed '''Bala-i-Balan''', '''Balaïbalan''', '''Balibilen''' vel sim, is a [[constructed language]] created in [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] or [[Safavid]] [[Iran]], and one of the first known constructed languages.   Its original creator may have been 14th century mystic [[Fazlallah Astarabadi (Naimi)|Fazlallah Astarabadi]], founder of [[Hurufism]], or his followers in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="q"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUhwyBmBnI4C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Balaibalan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uiHlTNjkGIWAhQfXqpCODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Balaibalan&amp;f=false|title=Syncretistic Religious Communities in the Near East|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may have been [[Muhyî-i Gülşenî]], born in [[Edirne]], a member of the [[Gulshani|Gülşenî]] [[sufi]] order in Cairo; in any case, the elaboration of the language was a collective endeavour.  The sole documentary attestation of Bâleybelen is a dictionary, copies of which are to be found in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris and in the [[Princeton University Library]].

Balaibalan is an [[A priori (languages)|a priori]] language, written with the Ottoman variant of the [[Arabic alphabet]].   The grammar follows the lead of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; like Turkish, it is [[agglutinating]].  Much of the [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] appears wholly invented, but some words are borrowed from Arabic and the other source languages, and others can be traced back to words of the source languages in an indirect manner, via [[Sufi]] metaphor.   For example:
* ''-gab-'', the stem of the verb 'deliberate', is explained by the dictionary as being built out of the letters ''b'', which indicates shared action between multiple people, and ''g'', which indicates publicizing.
* ''ḏāt'' 'origin' appears to be borrowed from Arabic ''ḏāt'', which means 'essence.'
* ''mim'' 'mouth' may reflect the Arabic name ''mim'' of the letter [[م]], whose shape is often compared in poetry to that of a mouth.

Balaibalan is the only well-documented early constructed language that is not of European origin, and it is independent of the fashion for language construction that occurred in the [[Renaissance]].  In contrast to the [[philosophical language]]s which prevailed then, and the languages designed for [[international auxiliary language|facilitating worldwide communication]] or for [[artistic language|use in literature or film]] most prominent today, Balaibalan was probably designed as a holy or poetic language for religious reasons, like [[Lingua Ignota]] and perhaps [[Damin]]. Balaibalan may also have been a secret language which was only known by an inner circle.

[[File:Bannwald BaWue Schild.jpg|thumb|Information sign]]
'''''Bannwald''''' is a German word used in parts of Germany and Austria to designate an area of protected forest. Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Bannwald'' is a combination of ''Bann'' (English ''ban'') and ''Wald'' (English ''forest'' or ''wood''). ''Bann'' has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Mitchell Kemble]]|title=The Saxons in England: A History of the English Commonwealth Till the Period of the Norman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGGZGJBRT-8C&amp;pg|date=1849|publisher=[[Longman]]|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Bannwald'' was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it.&lt;ref name="Forestry"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Porteous|title=The Forest in Folklore and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZyjAQAAQBAJ|date=1928|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0486420103|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacob Grimm]]|title=Teutonic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2WhHX2peKEC|date=1835|publisher=[[Nabu Press]]|isbn=978-1171888192|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (obsolete) [[French language|French]] literal equivalent [[:fr:bambois (toponyme)|''bambois'']] (also: ''banbois'')&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Lorraine]]: [http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2012_0207_TAVELLA_ANNEXES.pdf Page 9, Glossaire: Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Suter: [http://henrysuter.ch/glossaires/topoB0.html Toponymes: Baimbo, Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Courrendlin]]: [http://www.courrendlin.ch/fr/Vivre-a-Courrendlin/Geographie/Lieux-dits/Lieux-dits.html Lieux-dits - Le Bambois: Forêt réservée et mise à ban]&lt;/ref&gt; is still the toponym of local forests&lt;ref&gt;Tous les Faits: [http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_(toponyme) Bambois (toponyme)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205051047/http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_%28toponyme%29 |date=December 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas which once were part of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In modern times, the term ''Bannwald'' is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.

== Scope ==
The term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:
* ''[[Protection forest]]'', for the protection against avalanches, [[rockfall]], [[mudflow]], or [[flooding]]
* ''[[Forest reserve]]'', forest areas protected for reasons of [[nature conservation]] and [[environmental protection]]
* ''[[Protected forest|Recreational forest]]'', sometimes also as [[recreation area]]

Depending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms ''banned forest'' and ''protection forest''.

[[Silvicultural]] use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in [[Baden-Württemberg]]). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of [[nature reserves in Germany|nature reserves]]. ''[[exclusion zone|Forestal exclusion zones]]'' (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary ''[[hunting|hunting grounds]]'' or ''[[game preserve]]s'' (areas closed during a [[hunting season]] or [[breeding season|breeding and upbringing season]]) are not classified as banned forests.

== History ==

The term ''Bann'' dates back to the [[Middle Ages]]. At that time a ''Bannwald'' referred to a forest area where the respective [[territorial lord]] had the exclusive right to use the forest (''forest privilege''). Originally this applied only to hunting (''hunting privilege'') and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of [[Switzerland]] banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for [[fencing]] torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of ''Bannwald'' plays an important part in [[Ludwig Ganghofer]]'s novel ''Die Martinsklause'' in which a tyrannical administrator in [[Berchtesgaden]] claims excessive privileges.

→ ''see also: [[:de:Liste der Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg|List of Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg]]''

In Baden-Württemberg, there are ''Bannwälder Totalreservate'', fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such ''total reserves'' are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are [[refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.

==== Bavaria ====
In [[Bavaria]] "forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification" and may be classified as banned forest."&lt;ref name=BayWald&gt;[https://archive.is/20130106012238/http://www.servicestelle.bayern.de/bayern_recht/recht_db.html?http://by.juris.de/by/WaldG_BY_2005_Art38.htm Bavarian Forestry Act of July 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hessen ====
[[Image:Bannwald rockenberg4.jpg|thumb|Information sign in [[Rockenberg]] (Hesse)]]
In [[Hesse]] a ''Bannwald'' is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, a ''Bannwald'' is a stricter form of a protection forest.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 et seq. of the 1975 Forestry Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, '''''Schutzwald''''' ([[protection forest]]), rather than ''Bannwald''.

'''Bzyb''' (also spelled '''Bzyp''') is a major dialect of [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], native to the [[Bzyb River]] region of [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abkhaz|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from standard Abkhaz mainly in terms of [[phonology]]. It shares the {{IPA|[ɕʷ]}} and {{IPA|[ʑʷ]}} sounds with the [[Sadz dialect]], and the {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}, {{IPA|[d͡ʑ]}}, {{IPA|[t͡ɕʼ]}}, {{IPA|[ɕ]}}, {{IPA|[ʑ]}}, {{IPA|[χˤ]}}, and {{IPA|[χˤʷ]}} sounds are unique to Bzyb. Standard Abkhaz (which is based on the [[Abzhywa dialect]]) lacks these sounds.

The Bzyb [[consonant]] inventory appears to have been the fundamental inventory of [[Proto-Abkhaz]], with the inventories of Abzhywa and Sadz being reduced from this total, rather than the Bzyb series being innovative.

'''Chanchala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[adjective]] basically referring to the unsteady vacillating nature of human mind and actions which need to be stilled, neutralized or controlled for gaining right speech and vision.

==Meaning==

'''Chanchala''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चञ्चल) means - 'inconsiderate', 'nimble', 'shaking', 'inconstant', 'moveable', 'flickering', 'moving', 'unsteady', 'fortune', 'wind', 'long pepper', 'goddess of fortune' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+chanchala&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

''Chanchala'' is the good word for 'vacillation' in Sanskrit language; in [[Sanskrit literature
Sanskrit|poetry]] the girl with the dancing eyes is called ''chanchalakshi'', which is considered to be rare attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A More Ardent Fire|author=Eknath Easwaran|publisher=Nilgiri Press|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxcNUISHyXEC&amp;pg=PT176&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lDkoU7mABIb8rAfj4YCwBg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as part of the literary evidence of [[Kushan Empire|Kusana period]], the word ''Chanchala'', like ''Dhavani'' and ''Rodini'', indicates the nature or action of [[Mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Roots of Hinduism|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0gwfmPFTLgC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VDsoU5qnB8WJrQeI0YG4CQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]](Sloka VI.26):
:यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् |
:ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वंश नयेत् ||
the word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1TkoU4rWJs2HrgelpoHwAQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dasam Granth]], which like the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is an important book of [[Sikhism]], it is not composed in [[raga]]s (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that ''Chanchala'' is the name a ''[[chhand]]'' or metre of sixteen syllables having ''ragan'', ''jagan'', ''ragan'', ''jagan'' and ''laghu'' consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as ''Chitra'', ''Biraj and ''Brahmrupak'', and has been used twice in ''Choubis Autar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasam Granth|author=S.S.Kapoor|publisher=Hemkunt Press|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-h8ptzp0lUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uD0oU_G0IYayrgfn2IBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjha#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==

''Chanchala'', meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism Vol.3|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNQ82_yYeK8C&amp;pg=PA788&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mTwoU9PQN4KMrgeh0IDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of ''Lakshmi'' in the [[Rig Veda]]. [[Lakshmi|Sri]] of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the [[Yajurveda]], and in the [[Atharvaveda]] (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. ''Jatavedas Agni'' is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet ''anapagamini'' reflects the ''chanchala'' i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goddesses in Ancient India|author=Prithvi Kumar Agrawal |publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=92–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FHvf59ceLEC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FzwoU5f0DouMrgfU0IFI&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lakshmi'' or ''Chanchala'' as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi: Tales of the Goddess of Our Time|author=Mrinala Pande|publisher=Penguin Books|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TLsJW-WInIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8TgoU_2hEoWyrAekvoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Lakshmi'' is ''chanchala'' i.e. quick on her feet, to make her ''achala'' i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Purohit Darpan: Lakshmi Puja|publisher=Associatian of Grandparents of Indian Migrants|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxMvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TT4oU8jnC8e-rgfq14DgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chuvansky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Чуванский язык) is an extinct [[Yukaghir language]] of [[Siberia]], part of a [[dialect continuum]] with the two surviving languages&lt;ref&gt;Tailleur  O. G., Le dialecte tchouvane du youkaghir, "Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher", Wiesbaden, 1962, Bd 34.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was most likely last spoken in the 18th century. Chuvansky was widespread in the lower region of the [[Anadyr River]] (near [[Chuvanskoye]]), spoken by [[Chuvans]]. The translations of 22 sentences, recorded in [[1781]] by I. Benzig, and 210 words written by [[Fyodor Matyushkin|FF Matyushkin]] have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Matyushkin  FF, Collection of the words of the Chuvansky and Omok languages, in: Vrangel  F.P., Journey through the northern shores of Siberia and along the Arctic Ocean, accomplished in 1820-1824, Part 2, Additions, St. Petersburg, 1841 ;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''concept and object''' is attributable to the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]].

==Overview==
According to Frege, any sentence that expresses a singular thought consists of an expression (a [[proper names|proper name]] or a general term plus the definite article) that signifies an Object together with a  predicate (the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] "is", plus a general term accompanied by the indefinite article or an adjective) that signifies (''bedeutet'') a Concept.  Thus "Socrates is a philosopher" consists of "Socrates", which signifies the Object ''Socrates'', and "is a philosopher", which signifies the Concept of ''being a philosopher''.

This was a considerable departure from the traditional [[term logic]], in which every proposition (i.e. sentence) consisted of two [[general term]]s joined by the copula "is".

The distinction was of fundamental importance to the development of logic and mathematics.  Frege's distinction helped to clarify the notions of a [[set theory|set]], of the membership relation between element and set, and of [[empty set|empty]] and [[infinite set]]s.  However, Frege's conception of a class (in his terminology an extension of a concept) differs from the current iterative conception of a set.

Frege's distinction leads to the famous difficulty or "awkwardness of language" that some expressions which purport to signify a concept — Frege's example is "the concept ''horse''" — are grammatically expressions that by his criterion signify an Object.  Thus "the concept ''horse'' is not a concept, whereas the city of Berlin is a city".

[[Anthony Kenny]] sought to justify the distinction, other philosophers such as Hartley Slater and [[Crispin Wright]] have argued that the distinguished category of ''entity'' cannot be associated with predication in the way that individual objects are associated with the use of [[singular term]]s.

In [[literature]], '''confessional writing''' is a first-person style that is often presented as an ongoing diary or letters, distinguished by revelations of a person's deeper or darker motivations.

Originally, the term derived from [[Confession (religion)|confession]]: The writer is not only autobiographically recounting his life, but confessing to his sins. Among the earlier examples is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', perhaps the first autobiography of Western Europe. In it, he not only recounted the events of his life, he wrestled with their meaning and significance, as in a passage where he tried to fathom why he had stolen pears with friends, not to eat but to throw away.

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] turned it to a secular purpose in his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]''.

From this meaning evolved the meaning of writing that reveals more of the writer's motivations, particularly the darker reactions, and the events that are normally kept secret.

Fictionally, the confessional story is a story written, in the first person, about emotionally fraught and morally charged situations in which a [[fictional character]] is caught. These stories may be anything from thinly veiled recounting of the writer's life to completely fictional works.

With the advent of the magazine ''[[True Story (magazine)|True Story]]'' in 1919 and the imitations of it, the confessional (or romance) magazine was created, containing such stories.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Scott, ''Fresh Lipstick:  Redressing Fashion and Feminism'' p 158 {{ISBN|1-4039-6686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such confessions magazines were chiefly aimed at an audience of working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Honey, ''Creating Rosie the Riveter:  Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II'', p. 139, {{ISBN|0-87023-443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their formula has been characterized as "sin-suffer-repent": The heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson and resolves to live in light of it, not embittered by her pain.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Honey, ''Creating Rosie the Riveter:  Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II'', p. 141-43, {{ISBN|0-87023-443-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|}}
'''Evolutionary psychology of language''' is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of [[evolutionary psychology]]. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a [[Darwinian adaptation]].

There are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an [[adaptation]], an [[exaptation]], or a by-product. [[Heredity|Genetics]] also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the [[FOXP2]] gene may be what gives [[human]]s the ability to develop [[grammar]] and [[syntax]].

==Language evolution theories==

In the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an [[adaptation]], those who believe it is a [[by-product]] of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an [[exaptation]].

===Adaptation===
Scientist and psychologists [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the [[evolutionary psychology|psychological evolved]] traits and the [[evolutionary biology|physical evolved]] traits.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Richardson,  | first = R. | title = The prospects for an evolutionary psychology: Human language and human reasoning |publisher = Springer | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00389658 | journal = Minds and Machines| volume =6| issue = 4| pages = 541–557| date = November 1996 | accessdate = 2 January 2014 | doi=10.1007/BF00389658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker, though he mostly agrees with [[Noam Chomsky]], a [[linguist]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientist]], in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the [[organic (model)|organic]] nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) ''Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.'' Cambridge University Press p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By-product/Spandrel===
Noam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words.&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;Chomsky, N., ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use.'' Praeger, New York. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt; Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.&lt;ref name="Chomsky" /&gt;
On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2011). ''The Evolution of Language.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. p. 15. {{ISBN|052167736X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading.&lt;ref name="Fitch" /&gt;
He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use [[symbolic communication]] is integrated in all other [[cognitive process]]es.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon, T. The Symbolic Species. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaptation===
Exaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botha|first1=Rudolf P|title=How much of language, if any, came about in the same sort of way as the brooding chamber in snails?|journal=Language &amp; Communication| volume=21| issue=3|year=2001|pages=225–243|doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(01)00002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function.&lt;ref name="Botha 2001" /&gt; The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the [[larynx]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Fitch2"&gt;Fitch, T., "Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Human Language Evolution: Constraints on Adaptation." "Evolutionary Biology". 39:4. pp. 613-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Fitch2" /&gt;

==Genes and language==
Research has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module.&lt;ref name="Chater"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chater | first1 = N. | last2 = Florencia | first2 = R. | last3 = Christiansen | first3 = M. H. | year = | title = Restrictions on biological adaptation in language evolution | url = | journal = [[PNAS]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 1015–1020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807191106 | pmc = 2633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;
 
The [[Baldwin effect]] provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt; As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”&lt;ref name="Chater" /&gt;

===FOXP2 gene===
[[File:Protein FOXP2 PDB 2a07.png|thumb|Structure of the [[FOXP2]] protein. Based on [[PyMOL]] rendering of [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) 2ao9.]]
{{main|FOXP2}}
The genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works.&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff"&gt;Fisher, S.E. &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). "FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language." ''Cell Press'' pp.166-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 [[gene]] may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist [[Myrna Gopnik]] identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[language disorder]]. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]].&lt;ref name="Fisher&amp;Scharff" /&gt;

This gene most likely evolved in the [[hominini|hominin]] line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby"&gt;Christianse, M. H. &amp; Kirby, S. (2004). ''Language Evolution.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a unique [[allele]] of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name="Christiane&amp;Kirby" /&gt; This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.

==Variation in human language==
In the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through [[Cultural differentialism|cultural differentiation]]. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: [[founder effect]]s, [[drift (linguistics)|drift]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Levinson | first1 = SC. | last2 = Gray | first2 = RD. | title = Tools from evolutionary biology shed new light on the diversification of languages. | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–73 |date=March 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.01.007 | pmid = 22336727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.&lt;ref name="Levinson 2012"/&gt;

Atkinson theorized that language may have originated in [[Africa]] since [[African languages]] have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.&lt;ref name="Bower 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bower|first1=Bruce|title=Darwin's tongues: Languages, like genes, can tell evolutionary tales|journal=Science News|volume=180| issue=11|year=2011| pages=22–25|issn=0036-8423|doi=10.1002/scin.5591801128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication in other animals==
Research indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages.&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;Hauser, M. D., et al. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science 298. pp. 1569-1579.&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;
Vocal imitation is not uniquely human as well.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating.&lt;ref name="Haesler 2004"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haesler S, Wada K, Nshdejan A, etal |title=FoxP2 expression in avian vocal learners and non-learners |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=24 |issue=13 |pages=3164–75 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15056696 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4369-03.2004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haesler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haesler S, Rochefort C, Georgi B, Licznerski P, Osten P, Scharff C |title=Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e321 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18052609 |pmc=2100148 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

[[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] and [[Nim Chimpsky]] are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8363">'''Free writing'''  is a [[prewriting]] technique in which a person writes continuously for a set period of time without regard to spelling, grammar, or topic. It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by [[prose]] writers and writing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/GRAMMAR/composition/brainstorm_freewrite.htm |title=Getting Started: Freewriting |publisher=Grammar.ccc.commnet.edu |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconsciouslife.com/liberate-your-mind-with-free-writing.htm|title=Liberate Your Mind with Free Writing|publisher=theconsciouslife.com|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[writers]] use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as [[automatic writing]].

Unlike [[brainstorming]] where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.

==History==
[[Dorothea Brande]] was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book ''Becoming a Writer'' (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can.

[[Peter Elbow]] advanced freewriting in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'' (1975), and it has been popularized by [[Julia Cameron]] through her book ''The Artist's Way'' (1992).

==Technique==
The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections.  If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will ''write'' that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.

Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.

The writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines [[blog]]ging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.

==Definition==
Free writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, [[Peter Elbow]], and [[Natalie Goldberg]].&lt;ref name="Cole2001"&gt;{{cite journal

*Give yourself a time limit. Write for one or ten or twenty minutes, and then stop.
*Keep your hand moving until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you've written. Write quickly but not in a hurry.
*Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.
*If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving.
*If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that.
*When the time is up, look over what you've written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free-writing session.

Goldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by [[Jack Kerouac]], whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 "rules" in his Belief &amp; Technique for Modern Prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-technique.html|title=Kerouac on technique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kerouac's "rules" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose,&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/kerouac-spontaneous.html|title=Kerouac, Spontaneous Prose|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Kerouac himself cites the "trance writing" of [[William Butler Yeats]] as a precursor of his own practice.&lt;ref name="writing.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Goldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.

The satirical use of such a format may date back to the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]]; the group of cognate terms appears to belong to the 20th century.

==History==

In an essay entitled “L’art du grommelot” (Le Figaro, April 20, 2006), French scholar Claude Duneton suggests the word (not the technique) – in its French form, ''grommelot'' – has its origins in the ''commedia dell’arte''-derived Italian theatre of the early part of the sixteenth century. Duneton studied briefly with Léon Chancerel (1886–1965), who was a major figure in this branch of theatre. Chancerel in fact uses the word in his book, ''Le théâtre et la jeunesse'' (Paris: Bourrellier 1946:47). Others, such as theatre scholar John Rudlin in ''Commedia dell'arte: An Actor's Handbook'' (London: Routledge 1994:60), suggest this origin as well.

While the historical origin of the term is unclear, it has been particularly popularized by the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-winning Italian [[playwright]] [[Dario Fo]]. His 1969 show ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") was a satirical touring performance involving sketches based on mediaeval sources, told in Fo's own grammelots constructed from archaic [[Po Valley]] dialects and [[phoneme]]s from modern languages (he has coined separate Italian, French and American grammelots). In his Nobel lecture, Fo referred to the 16th-century Italian playwright [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzzante]]'s invention of a similar language based on Italian dialects, Latin, Spanish, German and onomatopoeic sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/fo-lecture.html|title=Dario Fo - Nobel Lecture: Against Jesters Who Defame and Insult|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable modern Italian exponent is the [[Milan]] actor/writer [[Gianni Ferrario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammelot.com/eng_eng/ Grammelot.com], Gianni Ferrario&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voice actor]] [[Carlo Bonomi]], also from Milan, used grammelot to voice [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s cartoon [[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]] and many years later, outside of Italy, [[Otmar Gutmann]]'s [[Pingu]]. Mainstream [[comedian|comics]] have also used Grammelot-like language: for instance, [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]]. The Canadian [[circus]] and entertainment troupe [[Cirque du Soleil]] uses in its routines similar forms of language; journalists often term them "Cirquish",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/arts/theater-cirque-du-soleil-aiming-too-high.html Cirque Du Soleil: Aiming Too High?], Polly Shulman, Teatroenmiami.com&lt;/ref&gt; but Cirque du Soleil's own staff use the word "Grommelot".&lt;ref&gt;Section 2, question 13: http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/fr/jobs/casting/faq.aspx{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}{{Wiktionary|Howdy}}
'''Howdy''' is an informal [[greeting]], originally a shortened form of the greeting ''How do ye?'' It was first recorded as part of the South England dialect in 1563/87.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' vol. VII, p. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature from that period includes the use of ''How-do, how-do'' and ''How'' as a greeting used by the Scottish when addressing Anglo settlers in greeting. The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as ''Howdy, howdy''.  Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as "Hello" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a [[question mark]]. Punctuating ''Howdy'' commonly follows these rules:
(i) If ''Howdy'' is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an [[exclamation mark]].
(ii) If ''Howdy'' is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a [[comma]].

In the rural Southwestern United States, ''Howdy'' is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of ''How do you do?'', and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. ''Howdy'' is also the official greeting of [[Texas A&amp;M University]], though the two are not always automatically associated.

The word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of [[WordPress]], a very popular content management system.&lt;ref&gt;http://trends.builtwith.com/cms&lt;/ref&gt; The probable reason for using "Howdy" (instead of "Welcome" or "Hello") in the dashboard is because [[Matt Mullenweg]], one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Boy howdy==
The phrase "boy howdy" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation "boy" to form an [[interjection]] which indicates an emphatic affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.word-detective.com/2008/07/boy-howdy/comment-page-1/ |title=Boy Howdy |work=The Word Detective |date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14316">In [[interpersonal communication]], an '''I-message''' or '''I-statement''' is an assertion about the feelings, beliefs, values etc. of the person speaking, generally expressed as a sentence beginning with the word "I", and is contrasted with a "'''you-message'''" or "'''you-statement'''", which often begins with the word "you" and focuses on the person spoken to.  [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]] coined the term "I message" in the 1960s while doing play therapy with children. He added the concept to his book for parents, ''P.E.T.: Parent Effectiveness Training'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Thomas. [http://www.gordontraining.com/thomas-gordon/origins-of-the-gordon-model/ Origins of the Gordon Model]. Gordon Training International. Retrieved on: 2012-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

I-messages are often used with the intent to be [[assertive]] without putting the listener on the defensive. They are also used to take ownership for one's feelings rather than implying that they are caused by another person. An example of this would be to say: "I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have the financial report yet", rather than: "you didn't finish the financial report on time!" (The latter is an example of a "you-statement").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/istate.htm "I" Statements not "You" Statements], International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict, Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

I-messages or I-statements can also be used in [[constructive criticism]]. For instance, one might say, "I had to read that section of your paper three times before I understood it", rather than, "This section is worded in a really confusing way", or "You need to learn how to word a paper more clearly." The former comment leaves open the possibility that the fault lies with the giver of the criticism. According to the Conflict Resolution Network, I-statements are a [[dispute resolution]] [[conversation opener]] that can be used to state how one sees things and how one would like things to be, without using inflaming language&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214256/http://www.crnhq.org/windskill4.html When to Use "I" Statements] from 12 Skills: 4. Appropriate Assertiveness. Conflict Resolution Network. Retrieved 2007-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==I-message construction==
While the underlying rationale and approach to I-messages is similar in various systems, there are both three-part and four-part models for constructing I-messages. A three-part model is proposed by the University of Tennessee Family &amp; Consumer Sciences for improving communication with children:
# I feel... (Insert feeling word)
# when... (tell what caused the feeling).
# I would like... (tell what you want to happen instead).&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Denise [fcs.tennessee.edu/humandev/kidsmart/ks_c2a.pdf "I" Message Worksheet]. University of Tennessee, Extension Family and Consumer Sciences. Retrieved on: 2012-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hope E. Morrow, a common pitfall in I-statement construction is using phrases like "I feel that..." or "I like that..." which typically express an opinion or judgment. Morrow favors following "I feel..." with a feeling such as "sad", "angry", etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traumacentral.net/i-statements.htm Constructing I-Statements], Hope E. Morrow, Massachusetts, MFT, CTS, 1998–2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{dead link|date=January 2018}}

Gordon advises that to use an I-message successfully, there should be congruence between the words one is using and one's [[affect (psychology)|affect]], [[tone of voice]], [[facial expression]] and [[body language]]. Gordon also describes a 3-part I-message, called a "confrontive" I-message, with the following parts:
*non-blameful description of the listener's behavior
*the effect of that behavior on the speaker
*the speaker's feelings about that effect
He describes the I-message as an appeal for help from the other person, and states that the other person is more likely to respond positively when the message is presented in that way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict resolution===
If an "I" message contains "you-messages", it can be problematic in conflict situations. For example: "I feel..., when you..., and I want you to..." This can put the receiver of the statement on the defensive. In a dispute, use of a phrase that begins with "I want" may encourage the parties to engage in positional problem solving. This may make conflicts more difficult to resolve. An "interest-based" approach to conflict resolution suggests using statements that reflect why the individual wants something.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227141411/http://disputeresolution.ohio.gov/schools/contentpages/Istate21.htm Rethinking "I" Statements], from Communication Skills, Skills and Concepts of Conflict Management. Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution &amp; Conflict Management. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of an "I" message in an interest-based approach:
* to avoid using "you" statements that will escalate the conflict
* to respond in a way that will de-escalate the conflict
* to identify feelings
* to identify behaviors that are causing the conflict
* to help individuals resolve the present conflict and/or prevent future conflicts.&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

The [[Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management]] summarized this approach as follows: "A sender of a message can use a statement that begins with 'I' and expresses the sender's feelings, identifies the unwanted behavior, and indicates a willingness to resolve the dispute, without using 'you' statements or engaging in positional problem solving.&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

The Commission proposed a four-part I-message:
#"I feel like___ (taking responsibility for one's own feelings)
#"I don't like it when__ " (stating the behavior that is a problem)
#"because____" (what it is about the behavior or its consequences that one objects to)
#"Can we work this out together?" (be open to working on the problem together).&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

Marital stability and relationship analysis researcher [[John Gottman]] notes that although I-statements are less likely than You-statements to be critical and to make the listener defensive, "you can also buck this general rule and come up with 'I' statements like 'I think you are selfish' that are hardly gentle. So the point is not to start talking to your spouse in some stilted psychobabble. Just keep in mind that if your words focus on how ''you're'' feeling rather than on accusing your spouse, your discussion will be far more successful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work|author1=Gottman, John  |author2=Silver, Nan|chapter=Solve Your Solvable Problems|pages=164–165|date=1999|isbn=0-609-80579-7|publisher=Three Rivers Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Benefits of I-Statements, Self-Talk===

I-statements have been found to offer a tremendous benefit to clients – patients.  I-statements encourage growth and maturation.  They are beneficial when employed with an individual struggling with self-defeating thoughts and mindset.

The therapeutic model varies on its take on the use of I-statements.  I-statements are designed to rid the myths from the reality of life.  I-statements are further productive in challenging one's innermost feelings.  Dr. Asa Don Brown, author with the Canadian Counseling and Psychotherapy Association stated that "Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings." If they reflect your "inner most" feelings, then understanding those feelings are necessary in overcoming one's negative perceptions and worldviews, according to Dr. Brown.

I-statements are capable of influencing one's path and design in life.  According to Girlshealth.gov, "An I-statement is a sentence that begins with the word "I." It helps the... (individual) take responsibility for their feelings instead of saying they are caused by the other person. This can help keep relationships open and honest between people when there is a conflict." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlshealth.gov/relationships/conflict/i_statements.cfm Changing statements from "you" to "I" – Relationships]&lt;/ref&gt;

I statements are important for clarifying one's position, contribution, and desires around a situation, event, and/or life perspective.   According to family psychology movement, I-statements are necessary for establishing a healthy relationship and an appropriate level of intimacy.

I-statements help the individual avoid blame, turning blame into personal responsibility.  Personal responsibility is key to learning to use I-statements.  Without personal responsibility, I-statements are null in their intention.

===Shifting gears===
Gordon states, "Although I-messages are more likely to influence others to change than You-messages, still it is a fact that being confronted with the prospect of having to change is often disturbing to the changee." A quick shift by the sender of the I-message to an [[active listening]] posture can achieve several important functions in this situation, according to Gordon.  He states that in Leader Effectiveness Training courses, this is called "shifting gears", and states that the person might shift back to an I-message later in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leader Effectiveness Training (L.E.T.): The Foundation for Participative Management and Employee Involvement |last=Gordon |first=Thomas |year=2001 |publisher=Perigee |location= |isbn= 9780399527135 |pages=113&amp;ndash;115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXr4tbe45ekC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22leader+effectiveness+training%22+%22shifting+gears%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the concept==
A book about [[mentoring]] states that communications specialists find that I-messages are a less threatening way to confront someone one wants to influence, and suggests a three-part I-message:  a neutral description of planned behaviour, consequences of the behaviour, and the [[emotions]] of the speaker about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShea2001|Shea 2001]] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

A manual for health care workers calls I-messages an "important skill", but emphasizes that use of an I-message does not guarantee that the other person will respond in a helpful way.  It presents an I-message as a way that one can take responsibility for one's own feelings and express them without blaming someone else.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDavis1996|Davis 1996]] p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; A manual for social workers presents I-messages as a technique with the purpose of improving the effectiveness of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSheafor1996|Sheafor 1996]] p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A study in Hong Kong of children's reactions to messages from their mothers found that children are most receptive to I-messages  that reveal distress, and most antagonistic towards critical you-messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCheung2003|Cheung 2003]] pp. 3&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; A study with university students as subjects &lt;!-- (since clearly [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=601983 this] is the same study)--&gt; did not find differences in emotional reactions to I-messages and you-messages for negative emotions, but did find differences in reactions for positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBippus2005|Bippus 2005]] pp. 26&amp;ndash;45&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of self-reported emotional reactions to I-statements and you-statements by adolescents found that accusatory you-statements evoked greater anger and a greater inclination for antagonistic response than assertive I-statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ451193&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ451193 Kubany, E.S. et. al., "Verbalized Anger and Accusatory "You" Messages as Cues for Anger and Antagonism among Adolescents", ''Adolescence'', Vol. 27, No. 107, pp. 505-16, Fall 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indeterminacy''', in [[philosophy]], can refer both to common scientific and mathematical concepts of [[uncertainty]] and their implications and to another kind of indeterminacy deriving from the nature of [[definition]] or meaning. It is related to [[deconstructionism]] and to [[Nietzsche]]'s criticism of the Kantian [[noumenon]].

==Indeterminacy in philosophy==
===Introduction===

The problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of [[existence]], can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.

Philosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s discussions of falsifiability in his works on the [[scientific method]]. The [[quantifiability]] of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.

===Kant and hazards of positing the "thing in itself"===

[[Immanuel Kant]] unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] by stating that there must "exist" a "[[thing in itself]]"&amp;nbsp;– a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a [[phenomenon]] itself. But, so to speak, "approximations" of "things in themselves" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as [[gravitational singularities]], ''certain aspects of which'' (e.g., their unquantifiability){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} can seem ''almost'' to mirror various "aspects" of the proposed "thing in itself", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various [[psychiatric disorders]] stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of [[Michel Foucault]], from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally "wrong" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (e.g., [[delusion]], one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered [[schizophrenic]]) in order to discover that the field of study known as [[abnormal psychology]] relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each "mental disorder" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., "almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, [[Alfred Wegener|Alfred Wegener's]] assertion of [[continental drift]] was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.

===Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the "thing in itself"===

{{See also|Nietzsche and free will|Eternal return}}
Relevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the "thing in itself" can be found in the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]], who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of "appearance" to "reality", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's [[noumenon]] in his ''On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense'' as follows:

: "The 'thing in itself' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicappeal.org/library/nietzsche/Nietzsche_various/on_truth_and_lies.htm Nietzsche, F., ''On Truth and Lies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Beyond Good and Evil'', Nietzsche argues against the "misleading significance of words" and its production of a "thing in itself":

: "I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that 'immediate certainty,' as well as 'absolute knowledge' and the 'thing in itself,' involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/ch01.htm Nietzsche, F. ''Beyond Good and Evil'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in ''The Will to Power'':

: "For all its detachment and freedom from emotion, our science is still the dupe of linguistic habits; it has never got rid of those changelings called 'subjects.' The atom is one such changeling, another is the Kantian 'thing-in-itself.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/modern/nietzquo.htm Nietzsche quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation versus equality===

The concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like [[Nietzsche]] of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity:

: "Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases&amp;nbsp;– which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"&gt;[[q:Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

: "What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"/&gt;

If one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share&amp;nbsp;– that which makes them "equal"&amp;nbsp;– but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as "x=x", one encounters fundamental differences between the two "x"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct "x"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one "x". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties ''not'' shared between "them", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.

In examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things "equal" seems to be indeterminate.

===The indeterminacy of the ''pharmakon'' in Derrida's [[Plato's Pharmacy]]===

{{main article|Pharmakon_(philosophy)|l1=Pharmakon (philosophy)}}

Indeterminacy was discussed in one of [[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's]] early works ''[[Plato's Pharmacy]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm Derrida, ''Plato's Pharmacy'' in ''Dissemination'', 1972, Athlone Press, London, 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010200631/http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reading of [[Plato]]'s ''Phaedrus'' and ''Phaedo''.  Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between [[Socrates]] and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'' 275c&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point.  As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment.  Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a ''pharmakon'' for the Egyptian people.  The Greek word [[Pharmakon (philosophy)|pharmakon]] poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison.  In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit.  The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people.  The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided.  The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.

===Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity===

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of [[insanity]] itself&amp;nbsp;– a ''very'' rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hunter S. Thompson|H. S. Thompson quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his ''Madness and Civilization'' can be found in the following excerpt from the ''Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html Foucault, M. ''Madness and Civilisation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907234548/http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html |date=2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'', Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French énoncé (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. 'Énoncé' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.
[...]
Rather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault#The_Archaeology_of_Knowledge|Foucault, M. ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as "insanity" and "criminality" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).

===Indeterminacy in discourse analysis===

Steve Hoenisch asserts in his article ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in [[Discourse Analysis]]'' that "[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticism.com/da/da_indet.htm Hoenisch, S. ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indeterminacy and consciousness===

[[Richard Dawkins]], the man who coined the term [[meme]] in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary, ''Root of All Evil?'', as "the process of non-thinking". In the documentary, he used [[Bertrand Russell]]'s analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: "Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml Dawkins ''World of Dawkins''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505103001/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml |date=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled ''The Evolution of Meanings'', in the section ''The Quest for Real Meanings'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material [...] for selection for a ''new'' purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a prediction for such evolution [of "purpose"]. The idea that there must be ''something determinate'' that the frog's eye really means&amp;nbsp;– some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses ''exactly'' what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain&amp;nbsp;– is just [[essentialism]] applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dennet argues, controversially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/phil/cons/qualia.htm Lormand, E. ''Qualia! Now Showing at a Theatre near you'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf De Leon, D. ''The Qualities of Qualia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226091151/http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[qualia]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in [[science]], or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral [[disposition]]s). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties
attributed to them by philosophers—incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The [[multiple drafts]] theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics   object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to ''oneself''.

The self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the [[Noumenon]], respectively).

For a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability&amp;nbsp;– that is, for it to be able to make an ''imperfect copy'' of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its "parent" meme than with some random member of the general "population" of memes&amp;nbsp;– it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself ''that didn't meaningfully differ from it'', that process of copying would more accurately be described as "duplication" than as "replication", and it would be incorrect to term these statements "memes"; the same would be true if the "child" statements did ''not'' noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their "parent" statements.)
In other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's "discursive formations") that inherits ''some'', but not ''all'', of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its "parent" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as ''advantageous'' to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.

It is important to note that indeterminacy in [[linguistics]] can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.

===Criticism===

Persons of [[faith]] argue that faith "is the basis of all knowledge". The Wikipedia article on faith states that "one must assume, believe, or have ''faith'' in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for [[knowledge]]." In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's [[noumenon]].

This would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see [[Nassim Taleb]]).

==Indeterminacy in new physical theories==

[[Science]] generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. [[Occam's razor]] tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as [[quantum mechanics]], actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's [[indeterminacy principle]].)

One ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, [[Steven Weinberg]], stated in an interview with PBS&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/view-weinberg.html Weinberg, S. PBS interview]&lt;/ref&gt; that:

"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory."

The Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a "[[theory of everything]]" notes that

"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless."

[[Chaos theory]] argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data.

As yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any "final theory" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the "indeterminacy" or "thing in itself" is the "final explanation" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in [[calculus]], in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations.

===Criticism===

Proponents of a [[deterministic]] universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, [[Einstein]] once stated that "God does not play dice" in a succinct (but now unpopular)  argument against the theory of [[quantum indeterminacy]], which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The "dice" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the ''probabilities'' that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how [[quantum mechanics]] addressed the problem.)

At first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a [[biology|biological]] standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would ''seem'' not to be beneficial to the species that holds it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether&amp;nbsp;– in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in ''either'' direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.
It might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems.  We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for "dog  with 1,000,000 hairs", "dog with 1,000,001 hairs" and so on. But conceptual [[vagueness]] is not [[metaphysical indeterminacy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Synonymous concepts in philosophy==
Uncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">'''Inferential role semantics''' (also '''conceptual role semantics''', '''functional role semantics''', '''procedural semantics''', '''semantic inferentialism''') is an approach to the theory of meaning that identifies the meaning of an expression with its relationship to other expressions (typically its [[Inference|inferential]] relations with other expressions), in contradistinction to '''denotationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which [[denotation]]s are the primary sort of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/proof-theoretic-semantics/ Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] is considered an early proponent of what is now called inferentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''[[Science of Logic|Wissenschaft der Logik]]'' Vol. II, Meiner, 1975 [1932], pp. 466 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PSW&gt;P. Stekeler-Weithofer (2016), [https://www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de/cm/philosophie/files/2012/11/StekelerHegelsAnalyticPragmatism.pdf "Hegel's Analytic Pragmatism"], University of Leipzig, pp. 122–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the ground for the axioms and the foundation for the validity of the inferences are the right consequences and that the axioms do not explain the consequence.&lt;ref name=PSW/&gt;

Contemporary proponents of semantic inferentialism include [[Robert Brandom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pragmatism-inferentialism.pdf "Pragmatism and Inferentialism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brandom | first = Robert | title = Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2000 | pages = 230 | isbn = 0-674-00158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilbert Harman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/concepts/NonSolips.html "(Nonsolipsistic) Conceptual Role Semantics" by Gilbert Harman]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Horwich]], and [[Ned Block]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/ConceptualRoleSemantics.html "Conceptual Role Semantics" by Ned Block]&lt;/ref&gt; Inferential role semantics originated in the work of [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

[[Jerry Fodor]] coined the term "inferential role semantics" in order to criticise it as a holistic (i.e. essentially non-compositional) approach to the theory of meaning. Inferential role semantics is sometimes contrasted to [[truth-conditional semantics]]. 

The approach is related to accounts of [[proof-theoretic semantics]] in the [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics of logic]] which associate meaning with the reasoning process.

Semantic inferentialism is related to [[logical expressivism]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Peregrin, ''Inferentialism: Why Rules Matter'', Springer, 2014, ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)|semantic anti-realism]].&lt;ref&gt; R. Ramanujam, Sundar Sarukkai (eds.), ''Logic and Its Applications'', Springer, 2009, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information and media literacy''' ('''IML''') enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[information literacy]] was research skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143339/http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]], a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |title=About CML &amp;#124; Center for Media Literacy |publisher=Medialit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191946/http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730105014/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530015206/http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "information and media literacy" is used by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711210412/http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html |date=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as [[Gregory Ulmer]] have also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==21st-century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), "technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034957/http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that "if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425195852/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key findings of the survey were:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the [[Internet]].
*38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet.
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term "[[digital native]]" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.

By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accessing information by using [[MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

== Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as "digital immigrants."  They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.

Learning a language is best done early in a child's development.

In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.

Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a "digital"-rich childhood.  Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. "Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power." Speaking "digital" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.

==Students' struggle==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.

When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

* What does each student need to learn?
* How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
* How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning?

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==In the curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/ |title=NETS Implementation - home |publisher=Nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314140756/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125507/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |archivedate=2009-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913115949/http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.

===Canada===
In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.

This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]]. In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology.  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Arab World===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed "New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. 

Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. 

In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. 

Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.

===Asia===
In Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/overview/index.html |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108150824/http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/overview/index.html |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2004/en/07_07.htm |title=HONG KONG 2004 - Education |publisher=Yearbook.gov.hk |date=2005-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum.

==Barriers==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.

Marc Prensky&lt;ref&gt;Marc Prensky 2006, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: "Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling."{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist.

'''International Francophonie Day''' ({{lang-fr|Journée internationale de la Francophonie}}) is observed within the [[Organisation internationale de la francophonie|International Organization of La Francophonie]]'s 77 member states every [[March 20]] to celebrate the French language and Francophone culture. There are over 369 million French speakers on Earth.

Created in 1988, the date celebrates the signing of the Niamey Convention in [[Niger]] on 20 March 1970. The convention established the ''Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique'', the precursor to the International Organization of La Francophonie.

The '''International Wittgenstein Symposium''' is an international conference dedicated to the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and its relationship to [[analytic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science|science]]. It is sponsored by the [[Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society]].&lt;ref name="Graz"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Graz, Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/|publisher=University of Graz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lud"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wittgenstein News|url=http://wittgenstein-news.org/events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1976, the International Wittgenstein Symposium was founded by [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]]. The location was chosen because in the 1920s, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools in the area surrounding Kirchberg am Wechsel. On the 24th to the 25th of April, 1976 (just prior to the 25th anniversary of Wittgenstein's death), the first conference took place. Only four of the five founders gave talks on his philosophical work at the first meeting, but at the second, 120 speakers attended from around the world.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Philosophical topics==

The general topic of each symposium centers around the philosophy and philosophy of science of Wittgenstein, but the specific topics change from year to year.  For example, the topic of the second International Wittgenstein Symposium was "Wittgenstein and his impact on contemporary thought" and the topic of the third symposium was "Wittgenstein, the [[Vienna Circle]], and [[critical rationalism]] (including a seminar on [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies|open society]]'')." A survey of topics is available from the [http://www.alws.at/index.php/review/show/iws_a_survey_of_topics_19762003/ site of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society].&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Proceedings==

Starting with the second symposium, the papers accepted for presentation have been published in edited proceedings.  From 1978 to 2005 the proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium were published by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky and are now published by ontos verlag. The proceedings published at ontos verlag are available Open Access online at a [http://wab.uib.no/agora-ontos site prepared by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen]. The Wittgenstein Archives have also prepared a site that contains an [http://wab.uib.no/agora-alws Open Access selection of symposium papers from the period 2001-10].&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Sponsorship==

The symposia are sponsored by the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society and they are largely funded by the government of [[Lower Austria]] and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31456">{{Other uses|Interpretation (disambiguation)}}

An '''interpretation''' is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].

The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their [[modal logic|modal]] analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate ''T'' (for "tall") and assign it the extension {''a''} (for "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant ''T'', and does not make a claim about whether ''T'' is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though ''we'' may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.

An interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the [[truth value]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], the interpretation is called a [[model (model theory)|model]] of that sentence or theory.

== Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}

A formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of ''sentences'' (variously  called ''words'' or ''[[well formed formula|formulas]]'') built from a fixed set of ''letters'' or ''symbols''. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called ''[[Well-formed_formula|well-formed formulæ]]'' (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (''P'' or ''Q'') is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.

=== Example ===
A formal language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined with the
alphabet &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \{ \triangle, \square \}&lt;/math&gt;, and with a word being in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; if it begins with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and is composed solely of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

A possible interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; could assign the decimal digit '1' to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and '0' to &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle \square \triangle&lt;/math&gt; would denote 101 under this interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical constants ===
In the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols ([[logical constant]]s) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that ''logical'' symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while ''non-logical'' symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.

Logical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ ("all") and ∃ ("some"), symbols for [[logical connective]]s ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), ¬ ("not"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.

== General properties of truth-functional interpretations ==
Many of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called ''truth functional'';{{dubious|reason=The article 'Truth-functional' gives a more restricted definition: the truth-value of a compound sentence should be a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.|date=September 2015}} they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be ''[[satisfiable|satisfied]]'' by that assignment.

No sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation,{{dubious|reason=Except for paraconsistent logic.|date=September 2015}} but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is ''inconsistent''. A sentence φ is said to be ''logically valid'' if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a ''[[logical consequence]]'' of ψ).

=== Logical connectives ===
Some of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are [[logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] that represent truth functions&amp;nbsp;— functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).

The truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be [[logical constant]]s, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.

This is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:
*¬Φ is True [[iff]] Φ is False.
*(Φ ∧ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True and Ψ is True.
*(Φ ∨ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ → Ψ) is True iff ¬Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ ↔ Ψ) is True iff (Φ → Ψ) is True and (Ψ → Φ) is True.

So under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;"
|+ Logical connectives
!  Interpretation !! Φ !! Ψ !! ¬Φ !! (Φ ∧ Ψ) !! (Φ ∨ Ψ) !! (Φ → Ψ) !! (Φ ↔ Ψ)
|-
|#1|| T || T || F || T || T || T || T
|-
|#2|| T || F || F || F || T || F || F
|-
|#3|| F || T || T || F || T || T || F
|-
|#4|| F || F || T || F || F || T || T
|}

Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula ''F'': (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of ''F'' is True under that interpretation, ''F'' is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make ''F'' True again, since one of ''F''s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for ''F'' are the only possible logical interpretations, and since ''F'' comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.

== Interpretation of a theory ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

An ''interpretation of a theory'' is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a [[many-to-one]] correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a ''full interpretation'', otherwise it is called a ''partial interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Haskell Curry]] |title=Foundations of Mathematical Logic |publisher=Mcgraw Hill |date=1963}} Here: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations for propositional logic ==
The formal language for [[propositional logic]] consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only [[non-logical symbol]]s in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.

The standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the [[truth value]]s true and false. This function is known as a ''truth assignment'' or ''valuation'' function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign [[truthbearer]]s instead.

For a language with ''n'' distinct propositional variables there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable ''a'', for example, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2 possible interpretations: 1) ''a'' is assigned '''T''', or 2) ''a'' is assigned '''F'''. For the pair ''a'', ''b'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned '''T''', 2) both are assigned '''F''', 3) ''a'' is assigned '''T''' and ''b'' is assigned '''F''', or 4) ''a'' is assigned '''F''' and ''b'' is assigned '''T'''.

Given any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.

== First-order logic ==
Unlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]].  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number [[arity]] is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.

For example, in the language of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)

Again, we might define a first-order language '''L''', as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.

=== Formal languages for first-order logic ===
Given a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol "=" for equality (see the section "[[#Interpreting equality|Interpreting equality"]] below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.

=== Interpretations of a first-order language ===
To ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.
* A [[domain of discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the "universe of disourse"&lt;/ref&gt; ''D'', usually required to be non-empty (see below).
* For every constant symbol, an element of ''D'' as its interpretation.
* For every ''n''-ary function symbol, an ''n''-ary function from ''D'' to ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a function ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'').
* For every ''n''-ary predicate symbol, an ''n''-ary relation on ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a subset of ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
An object carrying this information is known as a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ({{not a typo|of}} signature σ), or σ-structure, or ''L''-structure, or as a "model".

The information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its [[free variable]]s, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the [[T-schema]], which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, {{nowrap|φ &amp; ψ}} is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.

This leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}}. The domain of discourse forms the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(''x''), where ''x'' is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is satisfied if there is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that φ(''d'') is satisfied.

Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.

Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property&lt;ref&gt;The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties "yellow" and "prime" are unary relations.&lt;/ref&gt;(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]]&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Intensional definition|intensional]].

=== Example of a first-order interpretation ===
An example of interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the language '''L''' described above is as follows.
* Domain: A chess set
* Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn
* F(x): x is a piece
* G(x): x is a pawn
* H(x): x is black
* I(x): x is white
* J(x, y): x can capture y

In the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of L:
* the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),
* the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).

=== Non-empty domain requirement === &lt;!--Please preserve this section heading; it is being used in another article --&gt;
As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as
::&lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]&lt;/math&gt;
fails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains |mr=0057820 | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2267402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W. V. | title=Quantification and the empty domain |mr=0064715 | year=1954 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=19 | pages=177–179 | doi=10.2307/2268615 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2268615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.

=== Interpreting equality ===
The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.

The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.

The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a ''normal model'', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called ''first order logic with equality'', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.

There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.

=== Many-sorted first-order logic ===
A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one ''sort'' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.

One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''.

== Higher-order predicate logics ==
A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.

There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. ''Full semantics'' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. ''Henkin semantics'', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.

== Non-classical interpretations ==
The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic.

Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean-valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s.  [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models.

== Intended interpretations ==
Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.

The intended interpretation is called the ''standard model'' (a term introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthonie Meijers|title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51667-1|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=9|author=Roland Müller|chapter=The Notion of a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.

While the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal [[deductive system|syntactical rules]], it naturally affects the choice of the [[formal grammar|formation]] and [[transformation rules]] of the syntactical system. For example, [[primitive notion|primitive signs]] must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; [[sentential formula]]s are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] [[declarative sentence]]s; [[axiom|primitive sentences]] need to come out as [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in the interpretation; [[rules of inference]] must be such that, if the sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; is directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from a sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i \to \mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a true sentence, with {{imp}} meaning [[material conditional|implication]], as usual. These requirements ensure that all [[formal proof|provable]] sentences also come out to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Carnap]] |title=Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications |publisher=Dover publications| location=New York |date=1958 |isbn=9780486604534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of [[non-standard model]]s is an example). When we speak about 'models' in [[empirical science]]s, we mean, if we want [[reality]] to be a model of our science, to speak about an ''intended model''. A model in the empirical sciences is an ''intended factually-true descriptive interpretation'' (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same [[domain of discourse]] as the intended one, but other [[value assignment|assignments]] for [[non-logical constant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hans Freudenthal |title=The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences (Colloquium proceedings)|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-94-010-3669-6 |date=Jan 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|reason=Every chapter is written by a different author.|date=September 2015}}

=== Example ===

Given a simple formal system (we shall call this one &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ \blacksquare, \bigstar, \blacklozenge \}&lt;/math&gt; and whose formation rule for formulas is:
: 'Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;. Nothing else is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;.'

The single [[axiom schema]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ast \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ast&lt;/math&gt; " (where " &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; " is a [[metasyntactic variable]] standing for a finite string of " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; "s )

A formal proof can be constructed as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

In this example the theorem produced " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; " can be interpreted as meaning "One plus three equals four." A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]] |title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic| publisher=University of California Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

== Other concepts of interpretation ==
There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.

In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''.  For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]].

A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''′ of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''′.

[[File:KB_Japanese.svg|thumb|A Japanese kana keyboard]]
In relation to the '''Japanese language and computers''' many adaptation issues arise, some unique to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and others common to [[language]]s which have a very large number of characters. The number of characters needed in order to write English is very small, and thus it is possible to use only one [[byte]] to encode one English character. However, the number of characters in Japanese is much more than 256, and hence Japanese cannot be encoded using only one byte, and Japanese is thus encoded using two or more bytes, in a so-called "double byte" or "multi-byte" encoding. Some problems relate to [[transliteration]] and  [[romanization]], some to character encoding, and some to the input of Japanese text.

==Character encodings==
{{Update|section|reason=The info about Unicode adoption is sorely out of date|date=January 2018}}
There are several standard methods to [[character encoding|encode]] Japanese characters for use on a computer, including [[JIS encoding|JIS]], [[Shift-JIS]], [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], and [[Unicode]].  While mapping the set of [[kana]] is a simple matter, [[kanji]] has proven more difficult. Despite efforts, none of the encoding schemes have become the de facto standard, and multiple encoding standards are still in use today.

For example, most Japanese [[email]]s are in [[ISO-2022-JP]] ("JIS encoding") and [[web page]]s in [[Shift-JIS]] and yet mobile phones in Japan usually use some form of [[Extended Unix Code]]. If a program fails to determine the encoding scheme employed,  it can cause {{Nihongo3|"misconverted garbled/garbage characters"|文字化け|''[[mojibake]]''|literally "transformed characters"}} and thus unreadable text on computers.

The first encoding to become widely used was [[JIS X 0201]], which is a [[ISO 646|single-byte encoding]] that only covers standard 7-bit ASCII characters with half-width katakana extensions. This was widely used in systems that were neither powerful enough nor had the storage to handle kanji (including old embedded equipment such as cash registers). This means that only [[katakana]], not kanji, was supported using this technique. Some embedded displays still have this limitation.

The development of kanji encodings was the beginning of the split. [[Shift JIS]] supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with [[JIS X 0201]], and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment. 

However, [[Shift JIS]] has the unfortunate property that it often breaks any parser (software that reads the coded text) that is not specifically designed to handle it. For example, a text search method can get false hits if it is not designed for Shift JIS. [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], on the other hand, is handled much better by parsers that have been written for 7-bit ASCII (and thus [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]] encodings are used on UNIX, where much of the file-handling code was historically only written for English encodings). But EUC is not backwards compatible with JIS X 0201, the first main Japanese encoding. Further complications arise because the original Internet e-mail standards only support 7-bit transfer protocols. Thus {{IETF RFC|1468}} ("[[ISO-2022-JP]]", often simply called [[JIS encoding]]) was developed for sending and receiving e-mails.

In [[character set]] standards such as [[JIS X 0208|JIS]], not all required characters are included, so [[gaiji]] ({{lang|ja|外字}} "external characters") are sometimes used to supplement the character set. Gaiji may come in the form of external font packs, where normal characters have been replaced with new characters, or the new characters have been added to unused character positions. However, gaiji are not practical in [[Internet]] environments since the font set must be transferred with text to use the gaiji.  As a result, such characters are written with similar or simpler characters in place, or the text may need to be encoded using a larger character set (such as Unicode) that supports the required character.

[[Unicode]] was intended to solve all encoding problems over all languages. The [[UTF-8]] encoding used to encode Unicode in web pages does not have the disadvantages that Shift-JIS has. Unicode is supported by international software, and it eliminates the need for gaiji. There are still controversies, however. For Japanese, the kanji characters have been [[Han unification|unified]] with Chinese; that is, a character considered to be the same in both Japanese and Chinese is given a single number, even if the appearance is actually somewhat different, with the precise appearance left to the use of a locale-appropriate font. This process, called [[Han unification]], has caused controversy. The previous encodings in Japan, [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]], [[Mainland China]] and [[Korea]] have only handled one language and Unicode should handle all. The handling of Kanji/Chinese have however been designed by a committee composed of representatives from all four countries/areas.  Unicode is slowly growing because it is better supported by software from outside Japan, but still (as of 2011) most web pages in Japanese use Shift-JIS. The [[Japanese Wikipedia]] uses Unicode.

== Text input ==
{{main|Japanese input methods}}
Written Japanese uses several different scripts: [[kanji]] (Chinese characters), 2 sets of ''kana'' (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed directly into a computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as there are far more kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an [[input method editor]] (IME), also sometimes known as a front-end processor, shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via [[romanization]] (''[[rōmaji]] nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:ローマ字入力|ローマ字入力]]}}) or direct kana input (''kana nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:かな入力|かな入力]]}}). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices – each of the 10 digits (1–9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the [[gojūon]] table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.

There are two main systems for the [[romanization]] of Japanese, known as ''[[Kunrei-shiki]]'' and ''[[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]''; in practice, "keyboard romaji" (also known as ''[[wapuro romaji|wāpuro rōmaji]]'' or "word processor romaji") generally allows a loose combination of both. IME implementations may even handle keys for letters unused in any romanization scheme, such as ''L'', converting them to the most appropriate equivalent. With kana input, each key on the keyboard directly corresponds to one kana. The [[JIS X 6002|JIS keyboard]] system is the national standard, but there are alternatives, like the [[thumb-shift keyboard]], commonly used among professional typists.

== Direction of text ==

Japanese can be written in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two directions]]. ''Yokogaki'' style writes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as with English. ''Tategaki'' style writes first top-to-bottom, and then moves right-to-left.

At present, handling of downward text is incomplete. For example, [[HTML]] has no support for ''tategaki'' and Japanese users must use HTML tables to simulate it. However, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] level 3 includes a property "&lt;tt&gt;writing-mode&lt;/tt&gt;" which can render ''tategaki'' when given the value "&lt;tt&gt;vertical-rl&lt;/tt&gt;" (i.e. top to bottom, right to left). Word processors and [[Desktop publishing|DTP]] software have more complete support for it.

Other significant minority foreign languages include [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].

The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Latvia/Latvia_Language_English.htm State Language Law] — Sections 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
The [[official language]] (''valsts valoda'', literally ''state language'') in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=167|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the [[Extinct language|extinct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonian language]], are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.

Since 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]] (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).

In 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. When ratifying it, the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], 2008 — see Paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the [[President of Latvia|President]]) prepares proposals in this field; the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]] (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.

== Official use of languages ==

Since the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=165 1992 Law on Languages] — Sections 8, 9{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the losses of the Latvian government in the cases ''[[Podkolzina v. Latvia]]'' ([[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]]) and ''[[Ignatāne v. Latvia]]'' ([[Human Rights Committee|UN HRC]]), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;''Жданова Д.'' ООН встала на защиту «Равноправия», «Час» 10.08.01.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from participation.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} - This is exactly what the mentioned ''Iganatane'' and ''Podkolzina'' cases are about - see, e.g., Para 7.4. in ''Ignatane'', Para. 36 in ''Podkolzina'' judgment--&gt; As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/legislation/rules-of-procedure|title=Rules of Procedure|website=saeima.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local councilors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=58052&amp;from=off Law on status of member of republican city or municipality council — See Section 4]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.

Names and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases ''Kuhareca v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=721719&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71557/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mencena v.

Toponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the [[Livonian coast]] - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.

The Electronic Mass Media Law&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/Electronic_Mass_Media_Law.doc|title=Electronic Mass Media Law|website=Vvc.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Language policy is an important issue in Latvia: here, demonstrators demand official status for the Russian language.]] --&gt;
The government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) [[nation state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.gov.lv/UI/imagebinary.asp?imageid=3124 Guidelines of cultural policy 2006-2015 "Nation state"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the diversity of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/VVA_angl.pdf Guidelines of the State Language Policy for 2005-2014] — p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity block]], comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvk.lv/cgi-bin/wdbcgiw/base/komisijas2010.CVKAND10.progr?NR=5|title=Programma|website=Cvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the nation state, where "language = nation", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.''

One critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |title=Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=James Hughes |year=2005 |work=Development &amp; Transition |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataliya Pulina in ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the [[European Union|EU]] whose language has no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наталия |last=Пулина |script-title=ru:Татьяна Жданок: "Русские могут влиять на политику Латвии" |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti|Московские новости]] |language=Russian |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326223109/http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |archivedate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the [[BBC]]'s Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:
{{cquote|There are as many Russians, proportionally, in Latvia as there are French speakers in Belgium. They argue that, being such a large minority, they should have the right to education in their native language if the demand exists—which it certainly does.&lt;br&gt;[They] say that Russian should be an official language with equal rights, just as Swedish is in Finland (for just 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Angus |last=Roxburgh |title=Latvian lessons irk Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4380437.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the political parties, [[ForHRUL]] offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population.&lt;ref&gt;ForHRUL programme (2006) — see section 7.5.: [http://rusojuz.lv/ru/party/programma/14661-/ Russian], [http://rusojuz.lv/lv/party/Programmas/24543-/ Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; In a draft of its political programme,&lt;ref&gt;HC programme project – section "Cultural and language diversity": [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Russian], [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmony Centre|HC]] offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.

On the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tb.lv/index.php?id=382|title=Jaunumi|website=Tb.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf Ethnopolitical tension in Latvia: looking for solving the conflict — see p. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041733/http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf |date=9 May 2007 }} {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.
(Sample size was 1,018 respondents, with 51% supporting or rather supporting official status for Russian and 44% opposing or rather opposing it.)

==Private use of languages==
The Law on Electronic Media&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"/&gt; prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/2003-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2003-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).

According to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/A5_VVA_valodu_prasmes_LV_Q.pdf Valodu prasmes ietekme uz ekonomiski aktīvo iedzīvotāju dzīves kvalitāti], 2006{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care ''et cetera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=10124|title=Noteikumi par tulkojumu nodrošināšanu pasākumos|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=102667|title=Noteikumi par valodu lietošanu informācijā|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=KDOC&amp;id=42090&amp;version_date=13.02.1997|title=Par sapulcēm, gājieniem un piketiem|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

Since the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revs.lv|title=Š. Dubnova Rīgas ebreju vidusskola|website=Revs.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Riga Ukrainian Secondary School, founded in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrschool.lv/|title=Rīgas Ukraiņu vidusskola|website=Ukrschool.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had originally used Ukrainian as language of instruction, but switched to Latvian in 1993/1994&lt;ref&gt;''Puķītis M.''

As at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by ECRI — see Paragraph 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Education law,&lt;ref&gt;Education law: [http://www.ttc.lv/index.php?&amp;id=10&amp;tid=59&amp;l=LV&amp;seid=down&amp;itid=13759 edition being in force between 27.02.2004. and 15.09.2005., English] and [http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=50759&amp;menu_body=KDOC current version, Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Гурин А. Г.'' [http://www.russkije.lv/ru/journalism/read/pervye-russkie-shkoly/ Первые русские школы]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Russian School Defense Staff|wide protests in 2003 and 2004]], the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).

In 2005, one judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/2005-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2005-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/2004-18-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2004-18-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has declared the proportion "60+:40" constitutional.

According to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners ([[Riga Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtuasd.lv/resource/show/3|title=Riga Technical University Department of Foreign Students|website=Rtuasd.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or according to special laws ([[Riga Graduate School of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=124716&amp;mode=DOC 2005 Latvian-Swedish Treaty on Riga Graduate School of Law] - See Article 7; there is a version in English under one in Latvian&lt;/ref&gt;). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the [[Baltic International Academy]].

In 2018, President [[Raimonds Vejonis]] promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141364&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval [[Livonian Confederation]], [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and, initially, under the [[Russian Empire]]. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia ([[Riga Polytechnicum]], founded in 1862). In [[Latgale]], the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.

From the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] instigated a policy of [[Russification]] in non-Russian areas of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Russia |last= Raisanovsky |first= Nicholas V. |authorlink= Nicholas V. Riasanovsky |year= 1993 |edition= 5th |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York; Oxford |isbn= 0-19-507462-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]], possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.

The pro-[[Bolshevik]] revolutionary [[Soviet (council)|soviet]], [[Iskolat]], declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=170|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=169|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became [[Daugavpils]]), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian,&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis.

State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=26&amp;id=238|title=Valsts valoda - Ministru kabineta noteikumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1934 [[Kārlis Ulmanis|Ulmanis]] coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;''Фейгмане Т.

Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas izlūkdienesti 1919-1940: 664 likteņi'', ed.

During World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the [[Holocaust]]). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.

In the postwar [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%).&lt;ref&gt;''demoscope.ru'' database: population of USSR and its republics (by ethnicity) — [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172652/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php |date=16 March 2010 }}, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172713/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php |date=16 March 2010 }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language "streams".&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas PSR augstākās mācību iestādes.

Latvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican [[Supreme Soviet]] on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Demographic background ==
&lt;!--{{main|Languages of Latvia}}--&gt;
In the first post-Soviet [[census]] in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lav|title=Latvian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, [[Livonian language|Livonian]] was a [[moribund language]] spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nyelvrokonaink |last=Nanovfszky |first=György (ed.) |year=2000 |publisher=Teleki László Alapítvány |location=Budapest |isbn=963-00-3424-7 |language=Hungarian, Russian |oclc=45621804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernšreits V.'' [http://www.livones.lv/libiesi/valoda/?raksts=168 The Liv language today] (published between 2005 and 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Grizelda Kristiņa]], the last native speaker of Livonian, died on June 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/death-of-a-language-last-ever-speaker-of-livonian-passes-away-aged-103-8k0rlplv8xj|title=Death of a language: last ever speaker of Livonian passes away aged 103|first=David|last=Charter|website=Thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.&lt;!-- and have been given special status under Latvian law with the intent to counter the policy of Russification under the Soviet Union--&gt;

In the 2000 census, 891,451 respondents listed Russian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing 37.5% of the total population, whereas Latvian was recorded as the mother tongue for 58.2%.&lt;ref name="2000 census results"/&gt; Latvian was spoken as a second language by 20.8% of the population, and 43.7% spoke Russian as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;LR CSP preses izlaidums: [http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.doc?type=doc&amp;serial=1022597092498 2000.

In age groups over 15 years, however, more Latvians expressed proficiency in Russian than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=470|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 71% of ethnic Latvians said they could speak Russian, and 52% of Russians could speak Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=389|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in [[Talsi District]] (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in [[Kuldīga District]] the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%;&lt;ref&gt;1989. gada tautas skaitīšanas rezultāti Latvijā. Итоги переписи населения 1989 года по Латвии — Rīga: LR Valsts statistikas komiteja, 1992 — 89. lpp./стр.{{lv icon}}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62.4% of population could speak Latvian, and 81.6% could speak Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020219174758/http://vip.latnet.lv/LPRA/migranti.htm ] &lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/home-latvian-spoken-62-latvian-population-majority-vidzeme-and-lubana-county-39158.html|title=At home Latvian is spoken by 62% of Latvian population; the majority – in Vidzeme and Lubāna county - Latvijas statistika|website=Csb.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International recommendations ==
In 1999, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] found Latvia's new language law to be "essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/item/4702.html |title=High Commissioner welcomes State Language Law in Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-29 |author=OSCE Press Statement |year=1999 |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were "essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations", but that "specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/media/attachments/30/01/2012/Cilvektiesibas_Latvija_2000_1.pdf Human Rights in Latvia in 2000] [[LCHRES]] — p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification took place in 2005.

'''Linguistic philosophy''' is the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, the latter the position of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinguishes them from [[literary technique]]s, or non-universal features of literature that accompany the construction of a particular work rather than forming the essential characteristics of all narrative. For example, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Theme (narrative)|theme]], [[Character (arts)|character]] and [[Tone (literature)|tone]] are literary elements, whereas [[figurative language]], [[irony]], or [[foreshadowing]] would be considered literary techniques.

Literary elements aid in the discussion of and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be produced by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. For the most part, they are popular concepts that are not limited to any particular branch of [[literary criticism]], although they are most closely associated with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist method]] of professional literary criticism. There is no official definition or fixed list of terms of literary elements; however, they are a common feature of literary education at the [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] level, and a set of terms similar to the one below often appears in institutional student evaluation. For instance, the New York State Comprehensive English [[Regents Examinations|Regents Exam]] requires that students use and discuss literary elements relating to specific works in each of the three essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regents High School Comprehensive Examination in English|url=http://www.nysedregents.org/ComprehensiveEnglish/113/engl12013-exam.pdf|work=Office of State Assessment|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Majena''', also known as '''Majiena''' or '''Maxiena''', is an [[unclassified language|unclassified]], now-extinct language, originally spoken by the alleged Ticomeri people of the [[Llanos de Mojos]] plains in northwestern [[Bolivia]]. Nothing is known about the language itself, but sources state that it was unintelligible to speakers of the nearby [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] languages [[Moxo languages|Moxo]] and [[Baure language|Baure]] (the term "Ticomeri" is a Moxo exonym meaning "other-language"&lt;ref&gt;Hervás y Panduro 1805, pp. 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;) and possibly unrelated to any languages of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Métraux 1942, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; It may therefore have been a [[language isolate]].

Speakers of the language were identified in the mission settlement of [[San Borja, Bolivia|San Borja]] in the eighteenth century. There is some confusion between the Majena-speaking Ticomeri and another group, also known as "Ticomeri", who spoke a divergent dialect of Moxo. Whether the two groups were related (i.e. whether the Ticomeri had abandoned Majena and acquired Moxo) is unknowable, since both were apparently extinct by 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Hervás y Panduro 1805&lt;/ref&gt;

In theoretical linguistics, '''mirror theory''' refers to a particular approach to the architecture of the language organ developed by [[Michael Brody]], who claims his theory to be purely representational (unlike most of the current generative theories that are either derivational or combining derivation and representation).

==Phrase Structure==
There are several important respects in which '''mirror theory''' is different from more traditional theories of phrase structure in [[generative linguistics]] such as [[X-bar theory]] or [[bare phrase structure]]. The first principle, called ''mirror'', states that the syntactic relation 'X complement of Y' is identical to an inverse-order morphological relation 'X specifier of Y'. Thus, the notions of 'syntactic' and 'morphological' specifiers and complements are crucial for the linearisation of syntactic structure and its mapping to the morphological component.

When the structure is pronounced, it linearises in the following order: specifiers precede heads, and heads precede their complements. So when a sentence like that in the diagram below is pronounced, 'John' precedes the V-v-T chain, which in turn precedes 'Mary', the latter being the specifier of V. However, English is a VO language, which means that the morphological word 'loves' associated with the V-v-T chain is spelled in v, deriving the correct word order.

[http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/@fNKsYaIQUrKyTcsb/CXRWLPNx?18 Brody, M. ''Mirror Theory'']

== The Mirror Principle in Distributed Morphology ==
Similar to mirror theory is the '''Mirror Principle''' of the [[Distributed morphology|Distributed Morphology]] framework that deals primarily with issues of affix ordering.&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Morris &amp; Alec Marantz. 1993.  'Distributed Morphology and the Pieces of Inflection.'  In The View from Building 20, ed. Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser.  MIT Press, Cambridge, 111-176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually "leaves" on a syntactic tree. These syntactic "leaves" undergo operations that lead to the build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The mirror principle surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation with the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] of a given word merging lower than all subsequent [[suffix]]es that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope; morphemes that have scope over other parts of a words. To generate the proper linear structure, '''[[Left-Head Movement]]''' is applied recursively to include the morphemes that [[c-command]] a given root.

Empirical arguments for the Mirror Principle are provided by Baker's (1985) account for the distribution of a number of valence changing operations in [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], showing that the linear order of morphemes is related to the syntactic hierarchy in that morphemes are linearized in a reverse order to how they appear in a syntactic structure. His findings are summarized in ''The Mirror Generalization'', which states:  &lt;blockquote&gt;'''''Morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic derivations (and vice versa).'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The mirror principle and morphosyntactic explanation|last = Baker|first = Mark|date = 1985|journal = Linguistic Inquiry 16: 373-415|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The generalization is observed in Baker's (1988) account for [[Applicative voice|applicatives]] and [[Passive voice|passives]] in [[Chewa language|Chichewa]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Incorporation: A theory of grammatical function changing|last = Baker|first = Mark|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above examples attest the ordering of the applicative morpheme and the passive morpheme in Chichewa. In this language, applicatives may be passivized, however, passives can not be made into applicatives. Applying the Mirror Principle to this set of data, we assume that in the underlying deep structure of the syntax, all affixes that occur to the right of the lexical root ''perek'' are projected above this root in the syntax. These affixes are then adjoined to the lexical root via head-movement.

== Alternative accounts for affix ordering ==
Numerous observations in languages are also available, apart from the mirror principle. [[Yupik languages|Yupik]], for example, is able to account for affix order appealing entirely to semantic scope. However, semantic scope and the mirror principle are not mutually exclusive ways to account for affix ordering

Challenges to the Mirror Principle have been offered in analyses of the morpheme orders of [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Cupeño language|Cupeño]] by Harley (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001534/current.pdf|title = Affixation and the Mirror Principle|date = July 19, 2009|accessdate = |website = Lingbuzz|publisher = |last = Harley|first = Heidi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many accounts of the '''[[origin of language]]''' in the world's '''[[mythology|mythologies]]''' and other stories pertaining to the origin of language, the development of language and the reasons behind the diversity in languages today.

These myths have similarities, recurring themes, and differences, having been passed down through [[oral tradition]]. Some myths go further than just storytelling and are religious, with some even having a literal interpretation even today. Recurring themes in the myths of language dispersal are floods and catastrophes. Many stories tell of a great [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] or flood which caused the peoples of the Earth to scatter over the face of the planet. Punishment by a god or gods for perceived wrongdoing on the part of man is another recurring theme.

Myths regarding the origins of language and languages are generally subsumed or footnoted into larger [[creation myth]]s, although there are differences. Some tales say a [[Creator deity|creator]] endowed language from the beginning, others count language among later gifts, or curses.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Adamic language|Tower of Babel#Confusion of tongues}}
{{further|Tower of Babel}}
[[File:Confusion of Tongues.png|right|thumb|The "[[confusion of tongues]]" by [[Gustave Doré]], a [[woodcut]] depicting the [[Tower of Babel]] from [[Abrahamic]] myth.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] attributes the origin of language per se to humans, with Adam being asked to name the creatures that God had created.

One of the most well known examples in the West is the [[Tower of Babel]] passage from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. 
It tells of [[YHWH|God]] punishing [[Human beings|humanity]] for arrogance and disobedience by means of the [[confusion of tongues]].

:And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
:Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  (Genesis 11:5-6, [[KJV]] translation)

This became the standard account in the European Middle Ages, reflected in medieval literature such as the tale of [[Fénius Farsaid]].

==India==
[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As ''[[brahman]]'' "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s".
She is presented as the consort of [[Prajapati]], who is likewise presented as the origin of the Veda.&lt;ref&gt;"Veda, Prajāpati and Vāc" in Barbara A. Holdrege, 'Veda in the Brahmanas', in: Laurie L. Patton (ed.) ''Authority, anxiety, and canon: essays in Vedic interpretation'', 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1937-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She became conflated with [[Sarasvati]] in later Hindu mythology.

==Americas==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|right|Doré's "The Deluge". Man and beast take refuge on an isolated rock during the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], a feature of [[creation myth]]s from around the world.]]
In common with the mythology of many other civilizations and cultures which tell of a [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the water subsides, various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.

===Mesoamerica===
The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survive, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begot many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]] were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
A similar flood is described by the [[Kaska]] people from North America, however, like with the story of Babel, the people were now "widely scattered over the world". The narrator of the story adds that this explains the many different centres of population, the many tribes and the many languages, "Before the flood, there was but one centre; for all the people lived together in one country, and spoke one language."&lt;ref&gt;Teit, J. A. (1917) "Kaska Tales" in ''Journal of American Folklore'', No. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

:They did not know where the other people lived, and probably thought themselves the only survivors. Long afterwards, when in their wanderings they met people from another place, they spoke different languages, and could not understand one another.

An [[Iroquois]] story tells of the god [[Taryenyawagon]] (''Holder of the Heavens'') guiding his people on a journey and directing them to settle in different places whence their languages changed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E. [http://www.library.jbsheets.com/america/LegendsTraditionsandLawsoftheIroquois.htm Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians] (Access date: 4 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Salishan]] myth tells how an argument led to the divergence of languages.  Two people were arguing whether the high-pitched humming noise that accompanies ducks in flight is from air passing through the beak or from the flapping of wings.  The argument is not settled by the chief, who then calls a council of all the leading people from nearby villages.  This council breaks down in argument when nobody can agree, and eventually the dispute leads to a split where some people move far away.  Over time they slowly began to speak differently, and eventually other languages were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, F. (ed.) (1917) "The Origin of the Different Languages". ''Folk-Tales of Salishan and Sahaptin Tribes'' (New York: American Folk-Lore Society)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of the [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]], [[indigenous people of California]], a creator, accompanied by [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] creates language as he creates the tribes in various localities. He lays sticks which will transform into people upon daybreak.

:Then follows a long journey of the creator, still accompanied by Coyote, in the course of which he makes tribes in different localities, in each case by laying sticks in the house over night, gives them their customs and mode of life, and each their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, A. L. (1907) "Indian Myths of South Central California" in ''American Archaeology and Ethnology'', Vol. 4, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonas, Brazil===
The [[Ticuna people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Upper Amazon]] tell that all the peoples were once a single tribe, speaking the same language until two hummingbird eggs were eaten, it is not told by whom. Subsequently the tribe split into groups and dispersed far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R. (2000) "Origin Myths" in ''California Journal of Science Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

In [[Ancient Greece]] there was a myth which told that for ages men had lived without law under the rule of [[Zeus]] and speaking one language, gifted to them by the god and goddess of ingenuity, Philarios and Philarion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966398472|title=Multilingualism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Maher, John C.,|isbn=9780198724995|edition= First |location=Oxford|oclc=966398472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Hermes]] brought diversity in speech and along with it separation into nations and discord ensued. Zeus then resigned his position, yielding it to the first king of men, [[Phoroneus]].

In [[Norse mythology]], the faculty of speech is a gift from the third son of [[Borr]], [[Vé]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vili and Vé]]&lt;/ref&gt; who gave also hearing and sight.

:When the sons of [[Borr]] were walking along the sea-strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight.

==Africa==
The Wa-Sania, a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people of [[East Africa]]n origin have a tale that in the beginning, the peoples of the earth knew only one language, but during a severe [[famine]], a madness struck the people, causing them to wander in all directions, jabbering strange words, and this is how different languages came about.

A god who speaks all languages is a theme in [[African mythology]], two examples being [[Eshu]] of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], a trickster who is a messenger of the gods. Eshu has a parallel in [[Legba]] from the Fon people of [[Benin]]. Another [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] god who speaks all the languages of the world is [[Orunmila]], the god of [[divination]].

==Southeast Asia and Oceania==

===Polynesia===
A group of people on the island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] in [[Polynesia]] tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, speaking of a God who, "in anger chased the builders away, broke down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, R. W. (1933) ''Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia'' (Cambridge), vol. I, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[South Australia]], a people of [[Encounter Bay]] tell a story of how diversity in language came about from [[cannibalism]]:

:In remote time an old woman, named Wurruri lived towards the east and generally walked with a large stick in her hand, to scatter the fires around which others were sleeping, Wurruri at length died. Greatly delighted at this circumstance, they sent messengers in all directions to give notice of her death; men, women and children came, not to lament, but to show their joy. The Raminjerar were the first who fell upon the corpse and began eating the flesh, and immediately began to speak intelligibly. The other tribes to the eastward arriving later, ate the contents of the intestines, which caused them to speak a language slightly different. The northern tribes came last and devoured the intestines and all that remained, and immediately spoke a language differing still more from that of the Raminjerar.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, H. E. A., (1879) "Manners and Customs of the Aborigines of the Encounter Bay Tribe", published in Wood, D., et al., ''The Native Tribes of South Australia'', (Adelaide: E.S. Wigg &amp; Son) (available online [http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//SAhistory/Meyer.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of [[Australian Aboriginal]] people, the [[Gunwinggu]], tell of a goddess in [[dreamtime]] giving each of her children a language of their own to play with.

===Andaman Islands===
The traditional beliefs of the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] describe language as being given by the god [[Pūluga]] to the first man and woman at their union following a great deluge. The language given was called ''bojig-yâb-'', which is the language spoken to this day, according to their belief, by the tribe inhabiting the south and south-eastern portion of middle [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. This language is described by the inhabitants as the "mother tongue" from which all other dialects have been made.

Their beliefs hold that even before the death of the first man,

:... his offspring became so numerous that their home could no longer accommodate them. At Pūluga's bidding they were furnished with all necessary weapons, implements, and fire, and then scattered in pairs all over the country. When this exodus occurred Puluga- provided each party with a distinct dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Man, E. H. (1883) "On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands. (Part II.)" in ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 12, pp. 117–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus explaining the diversity of language.

In speech pathology and medicine, '''nasoendoscopy''' is the [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] examination of the [[velopharynx]], or  the [[nose]], often with a [[CCD camera]] or a [[fiber optic]] camera on a flexible tube passed through the [[nostril]]. It can provide information to evaluate speech and velopharyngeal function or dysfunction, as in diseases such as [[nasopharynx cancer|sinonasal carcinomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Pegoraro-Krook M. I., Dutka-Souza J. C., Marino V. C. (2008.) "Nasoendoscopy of velopharynx before and during diagnostic therapy", ''J App Oral Sci'', 16(3):181-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seikel J. A., King D. W., Drumright D. G. (2010.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFBOhaD1JHwC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=nasoendoscopy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Gx0-yTIMo&amp;sig=-1eUHWlu4ExSargCQ42ZfTzBRj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VabzUfXPO4zjkgWb3YHoBw&amp;ved=0CM4BEOgBMB8#v=onepage&amp;q=nasoendoscopy&amp;f=false ''Anatomy &amp; Physiology for Speech, Language, and Hearing''], Cengage Learning, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==

===Indications===
After removal of nasal packing following [[epistaxis]], routine nasoendoscopy is not necessarily indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Makarawo T. P., Howe D., Chan S. K. (2011.) "Is routine nasoendoscopy warranted in epistaxis patients after removal of nasal packing?", ''Allergy Rhinol'', 2(1):12-5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, widely accepted indications for nasoendoscopy include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitememorial.com/medical-services/nasoendoscopy-procedure Nasoendoscopy Procedure - White Memorial Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt;
*abnormal speech characteristics: hypernasal resonance, excessive nasal airflow including nasal air escape and nasal turbulence (also called nasal rustle), and absence of or weak intra-oral air pressure for oral pressure consonants;
*limited progress with speech therapy to establish oral pressure sounds;
*difficulty maintaining intra-oral air pressure and velopharyngeal closure during speech;
*patient has known or suspected abnormality of palate or velopharynx; and,
*patient is being considered for pharyngoplasty, maxillary advancement or speech prosthesis.

===Contraindications, complications, and safety===
No absolute contraindications exist for nasoendoscopy; and, while the procedure is relatively safe, the exact risk of the procedure depends on the skill and experience of the endoscope operator.&lt;ref&gt;Tabaee A., Hsu A. K., Kacker A. (2011.) "Indications, technique, safety, and accuracy of office-based nasal endoscopy with biopsy for sinonasal neoplasm", ''Int Forum Allergy Rhinol'', 1(3):225-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Non-lexical [[vocable]]s''', which may be mixed with meaningful text, are a form of [[nonsense syllable]] used in a wide variety of music. A common English example would be "la la la", "na na na" or "da da da".

==Traditional music==
Non-lexical vocables are used in [[yodeling]], [[Blackfoot music]] and other [[Native American music]], [[Pygmy music]], the [[music of the Maldives]], [[Irish Music|Irish music]], and [[Music of Scotland|Highland Scots music]]. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Heth, cited in {{cite book

|pages     = 368–369

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002542 "Native North Americans in Canada"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica: Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''. Accessed 01/23/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]], like other [[Plains Indians]], use the [[consonant]]s ''h'', ''y'', ''w'', and [[vowel]]s. They avoid ''n'', ''c'' (''ts'') and other consonants. ''i'' and ''e'' tend slightly to be higher [[pitch (music)|pitches]], ''a'', ''o'', and ''u'' lower ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nettl, Bruno]] (1989). ''Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives'', p.71. Ohio: The Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|0-87338-370-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIM Song]] has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]].

Other traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[Puirt à beul]] (traditional Scottish and Irish song form that sometimes employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Nigun]] in Jewish religious music
* [[Joik]] or luohti (improvised [[Sami people|Sami]] chant employing nonsense syllables and few or no lyrics)

==Jazz music==
{{main|Scat singing}}
[[Scat singing]] is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. "bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. [[Scatman John]] (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.

Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Anita O’Day]], and [[Leo Watson]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note.  Notable practitioners include [[George Benson]], [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], and [[Rik Emmett]].

==Vocal percussion==
Non-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:
* [[Bol (music) | Tabla Bols]]
* [[Beatboxing]]
* [[Konnakol]]

==Musical training==
* [[Solfège]], or solfa, is a technique for teaching [[sight-singing]], in which each note is sung to a special syllable (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti). 
* [[Canntaireachd]] is an ancient Scottish practice of noting music with a combination of definite syllables for ease of recollection and transmission.
* In India, the origin of [[solmization]] was to be found in [[Vedic]] texts like the [[Upanishads]], which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as [[Swara|sargam]]. In [[Indian classical music]], the notes in order are: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni.
* [[Byzantine music]] also uses syllables derived from a hymn to name notes: starting with A, the notes are pa, vu, ga, di, ke, zo, ni.
* In Japan, the [[Iroha]], an ancient poem, is sometimes used as solfège (i, chi, yo, ra, ya, a, we).

==Popular music of the WWII era==
The song "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938).  It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack.  The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:
  B-A-bay, B-E-bee, B-I-bicky-bi, B-O bo, bicky-bi bo, B-U bu, bicky bi bo bu.
  C-A-cay, C-E-cee, C-I-cicky-ci, C-O co, cicky-ci co, C-U cu, cicky ci co cu.
  D-A-day, D-E-dee, D-I-dicky-di, D-O do, dicky-di do, D-U du, dicky di do du.
  F-A-fay, F-E-fee, F-I-ficky-fi, F-O fo, Ficky-fi fo, F-U fu, ficky fi fo fu.
  ...

The song "[[Mairzy Doats]]" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:
  Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
  A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
However, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:
  If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,
  Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

==Popular music==
Examples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[A cappella]] (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables)
* [[Doo-wop]] (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Kobaïan]] (language used by French progressive rock band [[Magma (band)|Magma]])
* [[Sigur Rós#Vonlenska|Vonlenska]], also called ''Hopelandic'', (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band [[Sigur Rós]])

Jack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D

[[Van Morrison]] employed scat in his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Jim Morrison|title=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll|editor-last=Pareles|editor-first=Jon|editor-link=Jon Pareles|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|editor3-last=George-Warren|editor3-first=Holly|year=2001|publisher=Fireside|place=|isbn=978-0-7432-0120-9|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/van-morrison/biography|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scat singing]] influenced the development of [[doo-wop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It was popular enough in doo-wop that [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] made it the subject of a 1961 song, [[Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)]]". It has also appeared in various genres of [[rock music]]. [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] sings a chorus of slow scat on the song "Cars Hiss By My Window", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song "[[Roadhouse Blues]]"; scat singing also notably opens the [[B-side]] of [[Joe Walsh]]'s 1973 album ''[[The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get]]'' with the song "Meadow".  The technique was employed in the song "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" by [[Pink Floyd]], as well as the R&amp;B song "[[Rubber Biscuit]]" by [[The Chips]] (also as by [[The Blues Brothers]]).  The [[list of scat singers]] includes such greats as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mel Tormé]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Cleo Laine]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Van Morrison]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Scatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including [[industrial music]], in the chorus of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s 1991 song "[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Jesus Built My Hotrod]]"; [[nu metal]] music, in the band [[Korn (band)|Korn]] (whose lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]] has incorporated scat singing into songs such as "Twist", "[[Ball Tongue]]", "[[Freak on a Leash]]", "[[B.B.K. (song)|B.B.K.]]", "Beat it Upright", "Liar", and "[[Rotting in Vain]]"); and the heavy metal subgenre of [[death metal]], where scat singing is used by [[John Tardy]] of the band [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]. [[Jack Black]] incorporates scat into several [[Tenacious D]] songs, most notably: "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]", "Cosmic Shame", "Classico," "Jesus Ranch," Low Hangin' Fruit," and "Bowie". Singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] performs ad-libbed scats on the track "Yes or No". Other modern examples include "Under Pressure" by [[Queen (band)]], "Rag Doll" by [[Aerosmith]], "Under My Voodoo" by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], "No! Don't Shoot" by [[Foxy Shazam]], "Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz" by [[Mr. Bungle]], "In My Bed" by [[Amy Winehouse]], and "Stuck in the Middle" by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]. [[Scatman John]] combined scat and early-1990s [[electronic dance music]].

Examples by popular non-[[English-speaking|anglophone]] singers using such techniques include "[[Bla Bla Bla]]" by [[Gigi D'Agostino]], "Eena Mina Dika" in the Bollywood film ''[[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]]'', [[Eduard Khil]]'s "I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home" (known as "[[Trololo]]") sung entirely without lyrics, "[[Fuzao]]" by [[Faye Wong]], "[[Alive (Sa Dingding album)|Lagu Lagu]]" by [[Sa Dingding]] and "[[Din Daa Daa]]" by [[George Kranz]].

Due to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are "[[Louie Louie]]" as recorded by [[The Kingsmen]] and "[[Wooly Bully]]" by [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]].

==Disney songs==
A signature of some [[Disney]] [[musical film]]s is their songs' use of [[nonsense word]]s, the longest and most famous of which is from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', entitled  "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]".  A close second is "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Nonsense word song titles include:
*"[[Heigh-Ho]]" from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''  (1937)
*"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]''  (1946)
*"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''  (1950)
*"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]" and "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''  (1964)
*"[[Substitutiary Locomotion]]" from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), which includes the incantation "Treguna Mekoides and Tracorum Satis Dee"
*"Whistle-Stop" from [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]] (1973)
*"[[Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce]]" from ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'' (2000)

Nonsense lyrics also feature in the following Disney songs:
*"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' features a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"Trashing the Camp" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' also contains a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]" from ''[[The Aristocats]]'', sung by [[Scatman Crothers]] as "Scat Cat", contains lengthy scat sequences.

The '''North Baffin dialect''' (''Qikiqtaaluk uannangani'' or ''Iglulingmiut'') of Inuktitut is spoken on the northern part of [[Baffin Island]], at [[Igloolik]] and the adjacent part of the [[Melville Peninsula]], and in other Inuit communities in the far north of [[Nunavut]], like [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]], [[Grise Fiord]], [[Pond Inlet]], [[Clyde River, Nunavut|Clyde River]], and [[Arctic Bay]].

The governments of Nunavut and the [[Northwest Territories]] generally consider it to be a dialect of [[Inuktitut]], due to its location in Nunavut, as do some linguists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitree.org/trees/Eskimo%20Aleut:%20Goddard%201996@10422]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is instead sometimes classified as a dialect of [[Inuvialuktun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/map/CA___]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Inuktitut and Inuvialuktun form a [[dialect continuum]] with few sharp boundaries.

The North Baffin dialect is the spoken in the film ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originates in [[yachting]] in 1949 to describe a [[regatta]] race in which ship builders were allowed to enter as many different models of yachts into the regatta as they manufactured, but no more than one of each model (hence, "one of a kind").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Since then the term has found different and expanded use as an Internet acronym, especially with regard to the sale of handmade merchandise which is "one of a kind" with respect to actual production rather than to allowed number of entries in a competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9613">'''Official multilingualism''' is the policy adopted by some [[State (polity)|states]] of recognizing multiple [[language]]s as [[Official language|official]] and producing all official documents, and handling all [[communication|correspondence]] and official dealings, including [[court]] procedure, in these languages. It is distinct from personal [[multilingual]]ism, the capacity of a person to speak several languages.

==States with policies of official bilingualism==

===Afghanistan===
{{see also|Languages of Afghanistan}}
[[Afghanistan]] uses [[Dari language|Dari]] (or Afghan [[Persian language|Persian]]) and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as official languages. Many citizens are bilingual. These two languages account for 85% of Afghanis' native tongues.&lt;ref name="affactbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan |date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belarus===
{{see also|Languages of Belarus}}
In [[Belarus]], [[Russian language|Russian]] is far more common than [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and Section 17 of the [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]] designates both as official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/belarusian.shtml |title=Languages across Europe. |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burundi===
{{see also|Languages of Burundi}}
The official languages of [[Burundi]] are the local [[Kirundi language]] as well as the colonial French.

===Cameroon===
{{See also|Languages of Cameroon}}
[[Cameroon]] is extremely diverse linguistically and uses English and French as official languages.

===Canada===
{{Main|Bilingualism in Canada}}
{{See also|languages of Canada}}
In Canada [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]  have  special legal status over other languages in Canada’s courts, [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html|title=Official Languages Act - 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work=Act current to July 11th, 2010|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] is the only official bilingual province, while [[Quebec]] is the only province where French is the sole official language. The remaining provinces have English as the only official language. In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some bilingual services and some education in both official languages up to the high school level. English and French are official languages in all three territories (because they are federally administered). In addition, [[Inuktitut]] is also an official language in [[Nunavut]], and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]].

===Central African Republic===
{{see also|Languages of the Central African Republic}}
Out of 120 languages spoken in the [[Central African Republic]], French and the [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi-based]] creole [[Sango language|Sango]] are official.

===Chad===
{{see also|Languages of Chad}}
Citizens of [[Chad]] speak over 120 languages, and the standardized [[Chadian Arabic]] serves as the lingua franca with colonial language French also being official.

*[[Cook Islands]]

===Cyprus===
{{see also|Languages of Cyprus}}
Island nation of [[Cyprus]] has had [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as its languages since the 1960 [[Constitution of Cyprus|Constitution]] (Article 3, section 1). The usage of either language is complicated by the political dispute that lead to the creation of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

*[[Djibouti]]
*[[East Timor]]

===Finland===
{{see also|Languages of Finland}}
In Finland, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both considered "national languages". Municipalities of Finland are divided into three categories: unilingual Swedish, unilingual Finnish or bilingual. Finnish is the maternal language of about 90% of the population, and the bilingual or swedophone population is concentrated to the coastal areas of [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and [[Southwest Finland]]. The autonomous province of [[Åland]] is officially unilingual (Swedish). Both Swedish and Finnish are compulsory school subjects.

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Bilingualism in Hong Kong}}
{{see also|Languages of Hong Kong}}
Hong Kong is officially bilingual. Both English and Cantonese are official languages.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Languages of the Philippines}}
The [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippine constitution]] designates [[Filipino language|Filipino]] as the national language and – along with English – as official languages. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the national and official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remained, along with English, as a de facto official language until removed in 1973 by a constitutional change. After a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, when the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] removed its official status.&lt;ref name="official languages"&gt;Article XIV, Section 3 of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1935-constitution.html 1935 Philippine Constitution] provided, "[...] Until otherwise provided by law, English and Spanish shall continue as official languages." The [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1943-constitution.html 1943 Philippine Constitution] (in effect during occupation by Japanese forces, and later repudiated) did not specify official languages. Article XV, Section 3(3) of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1973-constitution.html 1973 Philippine constitution] ratified on January 17, 1973 specified, "Until otherwise provided by law, English and Pilipino shall be the official languages. [http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno155.html Presidential Decree No. 155] dated March 15, 1973 ordered, "[...] that the Spanish language shall continue to be recognized as an official language in the Philippines while important documents in government files are in the Spanish language and not translated into either English or Pilipino language." Article XIV Section 7 of the [http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-xiv/ 1987 Philippine Constitution] specified, "For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voluntary and optional"&gt;'''Article XIV, Sec 7''': For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English.

Some people in native Tagalog areas are bilingual, while in non-Tagalog areas it is common to be multilingual in Filipino, English, and in one or more of the regional [[Languages of the Philippines|language]]s, or as in other cases in languages such as Spanish, [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ([[Hokkien]]), and Arabic due to factors such as ancestry and religion. Eleven regional languages are recognised by the government as auxiliary official languages in their respective regions, while 90+ other languages and dialects are spoken by various groups.

'''Persuasive writing''' intends to convince readers to believe in an idea and to do an action. Many writings such as critics, reviews, reaction papers, editorials, proposals, advertisements, and brochures use different ways of persuasion to influence readers.

==Three common techniques in persuasive writing==

'''1.''' Presenting strong evidence, such as facts and statistics, statements of expert authorities, and research findings establishes credibility. Readers will more likely be convinced to side with the writer’s position or agree with his or her opinion if it is backed up by verifiable evidence. 

'''2.''' Concrete, relevant, and reasonable examples can enhance the writer’s idea or opinion. They can be based on observations or from the writer’s personal experience. 

'''3.''' Accurate, current, and balanced information adds to the credibility of persuasive writing. The writer does not only present evidence that favor his or her ideas, but he or she also acknowledges some evidence that opposes his or her own. In the writing, though, his or her ideas would be sounder.

==Ethos, logos, and pathos==
'''Ethos''' is the appeal to ethics. It convinces the audience of the credibility of the writer. The writer’s expertise on his or her subject matter lends to such credibility. The level of education and profession of the writer also come into play.

'''Logos''' is the appeal to logic and reason. It is the most commonly accepted mode in persuasion because it aims to be scientific in its approach to argumentation. In writing, facts are presented in a logical manner, and faulty logic is avoided.

'''Pathos''' is the appeal to emotion. This aims to convince the audience by appealing to human emotions. Emotions such as sympathy, anger, and sadness motivate humans; using pathos will then get the audience to be emotionally invested in the subject of the writing.

'''Pig Latin''' is a [[language game]] or [[argot]] in which words in [[English language|English]] are altered, usually by adding a fabricated [[suffix]] or by moving the [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] or initial [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]] of a word to the end of the word and adding a [[vocalic]] [[syllable]] to create such a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/pig-latin/|title=What exactly is Pig Latin, is it a language? And how is it a mystery? - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2010-10-05|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.&lt;br&gt;
'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | Love's Labour's Lost, William Shakespeare}}

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA638&amp;lpg=PA638&amp;dq=%22He+adds+as+many+new+letters+as+the+boys+in+their+%22hog+latin,%22%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=llFXqy226B&amp;sig=s89ZY3kpFsimFFr2f3F-gbN5KdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjegITDjtrJAhWNoYMKHfmGACIQ6AEIGzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20adds%20as%20many%20new%20letters%20as%20the%20boys%20in%20their%20%22hog%20latin%2C%22%22&amp;f=false|work=The Galaxy: A Magazine of Entertaining Reading, Volume 1|page=638|title=Sound and Sense|date=1886|author=Wakeman, George|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is similar to [[Língua do Pê]].

Another early mention of the name was in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'' in May 1869 "I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing," although the jargon is dog Latin.

''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".&lt;ref&gt;'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?]&lt;br/&gt;The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root among the general public yet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, "What a aybybay", where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding "ay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19470128&amp;id=d44tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SJ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4502,48597&amp;hl=en|work=Reading Eagle|page=12|title=Answers to Questions - The Haskins' Service|date=28 January 1947|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are "{{lang|en|[[wikt:ixnay|ixnay]]}}" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "{{lang|en|[[wikt:nix#English|nix]]}}" (itself a borrowing of [[German language|German]] ''nichts''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127424 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;), which is used as a general [[Negative (language)|negative]]; and "{{lang|en|[[wikt:amscray|amscray]]}}", Pig Latin for "{{lang|en|[[wikt:scram#English|scram]]}}", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Barry J.|title=Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAhYqpnC2H8C&amp;pg=PR48-IA149&amp;dq=ixnay+pig+latin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiputrKgrnUAhUJOz4KHTRJBlUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ixnay%20pig%20latin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicogenesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

==Rules==
For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/piglatin.htm|title=Useful phrases in Pig Latin (IgpaAtinlay)|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"pig" = "igpay"
*"latin" = "atinlay"
*"banana" = "ananabay"  
*"happy" = "appyhay"
*"duck" = "uckday"
*"me" = "emay"
*"too" = "ootay"
*"will" = "illway"
*"real" = "ealray"
*"simple" = "implesay"
*"say" = "aysay"
*"bagel" = "agelbay"
*"fail" = "ailfay"
*"poo" = "oopay"
*"party" = "artypay"
*"lonely" = "onelylay"
*"friends" = "iendsfray"
*"Lauren"" = "aurenlay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin|title=How to Speak Pig Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"smile" = "ilesmay"
*"string" = "ingstray"
*"stupid" = "upidstay"
*"glove" = "oveglay"
*"trash" = "ashtray"
*"floor"= "oorflay"
*"store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:
*"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
*"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
*"are" = "areway" or "areay"
*"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
*"explain" = "explainway"
*"always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
*"ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
*"honest" = "honestway"
*"I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*"every" = "eryevay"
*"another" = "otheranay"
*"under" = "erunday"
*"island" = "andislay"
*"elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.&lt;!--emma  = emmway
Please do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra). Do not add examples of language games that generate words through different patterns (such as, for example, adding nonsense syllables in between vowels or after words, shuffling the order of syllables, or systematically replacing certain phonemes with others. The preceding list is not exhaustive). Such examples should instead be added to the [[Language game]] article.--&gt;

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used in fun.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isay eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include [[Kedelkloppersprook]], which originated around [[Hamburg]] harbour, and [[Mattenenglisch]] that was used in the ''Matte'', the traditional [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood of [[Bern]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by [[voluntary association]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by ''i'', in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ''ee''.

The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket ("Fig language" – see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game § List of common language games]]).

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word kontti "container", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,"wikipedia" --&gt; "wikipedia kontti" --&gt; "kokipedia wintti". So converting the sentence "I love you" ("Minä rakastan sinua") would result in "konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti".

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or "[[Šatrovački]]" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for [[marijuana]] (trava - meaning "grass") turns to "vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [[cocaine]] (belo - meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [[pistol]] (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, [[brother|bro]] (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.

[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louchébem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louchébem'', or ''largonji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : Définition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larlépem largomuche du louchébem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienquès''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louchébem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en loucedé''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;u=umpqua&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA90553064&amp;asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

{{Wittgenstein|Later}}

The '''private language argument''' argues that a language understandable by only a single individual is incoherent, and was introduced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his later work, especially in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein introduced the notion in §243, and argues for its impossibility in §244-§271. Key passages occur in §256-§271.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument was central to philosophical discussion in the second half of the 20th century. 

In the ''Investigations'' Wittgenstein does not present his arguments in a succinct and linear fashion; instead, he describes particular uses of language, and prompts the reader to contemplate the implications of those uses. As a result, there is considerable dispute about both the nature of the argument and its implications. Indeed, it has become common to talk of private language ''arguments''.

Historians of philosophy see precursors of the private language argument in a variety of sources, notably in the work of [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account can be found in: Dejnozka, Jan ''Origins of the Private Language Argument'' Diálogos 66, 59–78, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Locke is also a prominent exponent of the view targeted by the argument, since he proposed in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' that the referent of a word is the ''idea'' it stands for.

==Significance==
The private language argument is of central importance to debates about the nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in one's head are distinct from the concepts in other's head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', and more recently in [[Jerry Fodor|Jerry Fodor's]] [[language of thought]] theory.

Wittgenstein argues, in his later work, that this account of private language is inconsistent. If the idea of a private language is inconsistent, then a logical conclusion would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private experiences or of private mental states.

==Philosophical Investigations==
{{Main article|Philosophical Investigations}}
The argument is found in part one of the ''Philosophical investigations''. This part consists of a series of "remarks" numbered sequentially. The core of the argument is generally thought to be presented in §256 and onward, though the idea is first introduced in §243.

===What a private language is===
If someone were to behave as if they understood a language of which no-one else can make sense, we might call this an example of a private language.&lt;ref&gt;§269.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a ''private language'' in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language – if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others.&lt;ref&gt;§256.&lt;/ref&gt; The private language being considered is not simply a language ''in fact'' understood by one person, but a language that ''in principle'' can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.

===The sensation S===
Wittgenstein sets up a thought experiment in which someone is imagined to associate some recurrent sensation with a symbol by writing '''S''' in their calendar when the sensation occurs.&lt;ref name="§258"&gt;§258.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a case would be a private language in the Wittgensteinian sense. Furthermore, it is presupposed that ''S'' cannot be defined using other terms, for example "the feeling I get when the [[manometer]] rises"; for to do so would be to give '''S''' a place in our public language, in which case '''S''' could not be a statement in a private language.&lt;ref&gt;§270.&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be supposed that one might use "a kind of [[ostensive definition]]" for '''S''', by focusing on the sensation and on the symbol. Early in ''The Investigations'', Wittgenstein attacks the usefulness of ostensive definition.&lt;ref&gt;§27–34&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the example of someone pointing to two nuts while saying "This is called ''two''". How does it come about that the listener associates this with the ''number'' of items, rather than the type of nut, their colour, or even a compass direction? One conclusion of this is that to participate in an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the process and context involved, of the [[form of life]].&lt;ref&gt;§23.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that "an ostensive definition can be variously interpreted in ''every'' case".&lt;ref&gt;§28, italics in original&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the sensation '''S''' Wittgenstein argues that there is no criterion for the correctness of such an ostensive definition, since whatever ''seems'' right will ''be'' right, 'And that only means that here we can't talk about "right".'&lt;ref name="§258"/&gt; The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called ''memory scepticism'', has it that one might ''remember'' the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term '''S''' . The other, called ''meaning scepticism'', has it that one can never be sure of the ''meaning'' of a term defined in this way.

===Memory scepticism===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
{{Original research|section|date=July 2013}}
}}
One common interpretation is that the possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore one does not have any firm ''criterion'' for using '''S''' in each case.&lt;ref&gt;This account is supported by §207&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, I might one day focus on ''that'' sensation, and link it to the symbol '''S'''; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have ''now'' is the same as the one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed '''S'''.

However, memory scepticism has been criticized{{By whom|date=July 2013}} as applying to public language, also. If one person can misremember, it is entirely possible that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree '''T'''; but the next day ''both'' misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined '''S''' ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.

This interpretation (and the criticism of Wittgenstein that arises from it) is based on a complete misreading{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, however, because Wittgenstein's argument has nothing to do with the fallibility of human memory{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, but rather concerns the ''intelligibility'' of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not, in fact, remember the sensation correctly, but rather that it makes no sense to talk about our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts it{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, is not so much that private language is "a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose".

Wittgenstein makes this clear in section 258: "A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But "I impress it on myself" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case, I have no criterion of correctness." This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.

Wittgenstein explains this unintelligibility with a series of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be "as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true."

===Meaning scepticism===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
{{Original research|section|date=July 2013}}
}}
Another interpretation, found for example in the account presented by [[Anthony Kenny]]&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Anthony. ''Wittgenstein'' pp.193–4&lt;/ref&gt; has it that the problem with a private ostensive definition is not just that it might be misremembered, but that such a definition cannot lead to a meaningful statement.

Let us first consider a case of ostensive definition in a public language. Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree '''T'''; but the next day misremember which tree it was they named. In this ordinary language case, it makes sense to ask questions such as "is this the tree we named '''T''' yesterday?" and make statements such as "This is not the tree we named '''T''' yesterday". So one can appeal to other parts of the form of life, perhaps arguing: "this is the only Oak in the forest; '''T''' was an oak; therefore this is '''T'''".

An everyday ostensive definition is embedded in a public language, and so in the form of life in which that language occurs. Participation in a public form of life enables correction to occur. That is, in the case of a public language there are other ways to check the use of a term that has been ostensively defined. We can ''justify'' our use of the new name '''T''' by making the ostensive definition more or less explicit.

But this is not the case with '''S'''. Recall that because '''S''' is part of a private language, it is not possible to provide an explicit definition of '''S'''. The only ''possible'' definition is the private, ostensive one of associating '''S''' with ''that'' feeling. But this is the ''very thing being questioned''.  "Imagine someone saying: 'But I know how tall I am!' and laying his hand on top of his head to prove it."&lt;ref&gt;§279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurrent theme in Wittgenstein's work is that for some term or utterance to have a sense, it must be conceivable that it be doubted. For Wittgenstein, [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] do not have sense, do not say anything, and so do not admit of doubt. But furthermore, if any other sort of utterance does not admit of doubt, it must be senseless. [[Rush Rhees]], in his notes on lectures given by Wittgenstein, while discussing the reality of physical objects, has him say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We get something similar when we write a tautology like "p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;p". We formulate such expressions to get something in which there is no doubt – even though the sense has vanished with the doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Language of Sense Data and Private Experience: Notes taken by Rush Rhees of Wittgenstein's Lectures, 1936'' Lecture VIII, February 24, 1936. in Klagge, James, Nordmann, Alfred (editors) (1993) ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophical Occasions 1912–1951''p. 318. See for comparison, ''Investigations'', §298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Kenny put it, "Even to think ''falsely'' that something is '''S''', I must know the meaning of '''S'''; and this is what Wittgenstein argues is impossible in the private language."&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (1973) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is no way to check the meaning (or use) of '''S''' ''apart from'' that private ostensive act of definition, it is not possible to ''know'' what '''S''' means. The sense has vanished with the doubt.

Wittgenstein uses the further analogy of the left hand giving the right hand money.&lt;ref&gt;§268&lt;/ref&gt; The physical act might take place, but the transaction could not count as a gift. Similarly, one might say '''S''' while focusing on a sensation, but no act of naming has occurred.

===The beetle-in-a-box===
The beetle-in-a-box is a famous thought experiment that Wittgenstein introduces in the context of his investigation of pains.&lt;ref name="§293"&gt;§293&lt;/ref&gt;

Pains occupy a distinct and vital place in the philosophy of mind for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Richard ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'', 1979&lt;/ref&gt; One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.

If we accept pains as special [[qualia]] known absolutely but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, this may be taken to ground a Cartesian view of the self and consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein invites readers to imagine a community in which the individuals each have a box containing a "beetle". "No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at ''his'' beetle."&lt;ref name="§293"/&gt;

If the "beetle" had a use in the language of these people, it could not be as the name of something – because it is entirely possible that each person had something completely different in their box, or even that the thing in the box constantly changed, or that each box was in fact empty. The content of the box is irrelevant to whatever language game it is used in.

By analogy, it does not matter that one cannot experience another's subjective sensations. Unless talk of such subjective experience is learned through public experience the actual content is irrelevant; all we can discuss is what is available in our public language.

By offering the "beetle" as an analogy to pains, Wittgenstein suggests that the case of pains is not really amenable to the uses philosophers would make of it. "That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation," the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant."&lt;ref name="§293"/&gt;

===Following a rule===
It is common to describe language use in terms of the rules that one follows, and Wittgenstein considers rules in some detail. He famously suggests that any act can be made out to follow from a given rule.&lt;ref&gt;"Whatever I do is, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule", §198–9&lt;/ref&gt; He does this in setting up a dilemma:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to conflict with it. And there would be neither accord nor conflict here.&lt;ref&gt;§201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One can give an explanation of why one followed a particular rule in a particular case. But any explanation for rule following behaviour cannot be given in terms of following a rule, without involving circularity. One can say something like "She did X because of the rule R" but if you say  "She followed R because of the rule R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;" one can then ask "but why did she follow rule R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;?" and so potentially become involved in a regression. Explanation must have an end.&lt;ref&gt;§87&lt;/ref&gt;
His conclusion: &lt;blockquote&gt;What this shows is that there is a way of grasping a rule which is ''not'' an ''interpretation'', but which is exhibited in what we call "obeying the rule" and "going against it" in actual cases.&lt;ref&gt;§201, italics in original&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So following a rule is a practice. And furthermore, since one can think one is following a rule and yet be mistaken, ''thinking'' one is following a rule is not the same as following it. Therefore, following a rule cannot be a private activity.&lt;ref&gt;§202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kripke's interpretation==
In 1982 [[Saul Kripke]] published a new and innovative account of the argument in his book ''[[Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Kripke takes the paradox discussed in §201 to be the central problem of the ''Philosophical Investigations''. He develops the paradox into a [[Grue and bleen|Grue-like]] problem, arguing that it similarly results in skepticism, but about ''meaning'' rather than about ''induction''.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. pp 7–25&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes a new form of addition, which he calls ''quus'', which is identical with ''plus'' in all cases except those in which either of the numbers to be added is greater than 57, thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{x quus y}= \begin{cases} \text{x + y} &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then asks if anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant ''plus'', I had not meant ''quus''. He claims that his argument shows that  "Each new application we make is a leap in the dark; any present intention could be interpreted to accord with anything we may choose to do. So there can be neither accord nor conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. pp 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripke's account is considered by some commentators to be unfaithful to Wittgenstein,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker, ''Scepticism, Rules, and Language'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984) and Colin McGinn, ''Wittgenstein on Meaning'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result has been referred to as "[[Kripkenstein]]". Even Kripke himself suspected that many aspects of the account were inconsistent with Wittgenstein's original intent, leading him to urge that the book "should be thought of as expounding neither 'Wittgenstein's' argument nor 'Kripke's': rather Wittgenstein's argument as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him."&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language''. pp 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">'''Proto-Mongolic''' is the hypothetical ancestor language of the modern [[Mongolic languages]]. It is very close to the [[Middle Mongol language]], the language spoken at the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Most features of modern Mongolic languages can thus be reconstructed from Middle Mongol. An exception would be the voice suffix like -caga- 'do together', which can be reconstructed from the modern languages but is not attested in Middle Mongol.

The languages of the [[Donghu people|Donghu]] and [[Wuhuan]] might be related to Proto-Mongolic,{{sfn|Andrews|1999|p=72}} as well as that of the [[Xianbei]] and the [[Tuoba]] clan/subgroup (the language of the founders of the [[Northern Wei]]) and [[Khitan language|Khitan]]. Because the surviving evidence for Xianbei/Tuoba is very sparse, one can hypothesize, but not definitively state, that a genetic relationship ''could be'' possible. In the case of Khitan, there is rich evidence, but most of it is written in the two [[Khitan scripts]] that have as yet not been fully deciphered. However, from the available evidence it has to be concluded that a genetic relationship to [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] is likely.{{sfn|Janhunen|2003b|pp=391–394}}{{sfn|Janhunen|2003a|pp=1–3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10849">'''Speech acquisition''' focuses on the development of [[spoken language]] by a child.  Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernthal, J.E., Bankson, N.W., &amp; Flipsen, P. (2009) Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children. (6th edition). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
While [[grammatical]] and [[syntactic]] learning can be seen as a part of [[language acquisition]], speech acquisition focuses on the development of [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]] over the first years of a child's lifetime.  There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.

== Development of speech perception ==
Sensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy.  Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies.  They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and 500&amp;nbsp;Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper, P. G., &amp; Shahidullah, B. S. (1994). Development of fetal hearing. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition, 71(2), F81–F87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lanky and Williams (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, R.E. &amp; Trickey, A.W. (2005). The Development of the Auditory System from Conception to Term. NeoReviews 6(3). DOI: 10.1542/neo.6-3-e141.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz as early as 16 weeks.

The newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. 
Speech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn1533 |pmid=15496861 |title=Early language acquisition: Cracking the speech code |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=831–43 |year=2004 |last1=Kuhl |first1=Patricia K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.

As an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase.  Rvachew (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S. (2007). Phonological Processing and Reading in Children With Speech Sound Disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology. 16. 260-270. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b7e/1674775fc3775c9c1a1da4b57c1e0ed2e821.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar.  In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.

It is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, V. &amp; Barrett, S.(2000) Development of phonemic categorization in children aged 6-12. Journal of Phonetics 28(4):377-396 · https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834995_The_development_of_phonemic_categorization_in_children_aged_6-12&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.

== Typologies of infant vocalization==

Infants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying.  As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. 
There are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699200500211451 |pmid=16728333 |pmc=3412408 |title=Assessing vocal development in infants and toddlers |journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=351–69 |year=2009 |last1=Nathani |first1=Suneeti |last2=Ertmer |first2=David J. |last3=Stark |first3=Rachel E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of 5 phases. 
#Reflexive (0 to 2 months of age) consisting of crying, fussing, and vegetative sounds
#Control of phonation (1 to 4 months of age) consonant-like sounds, clicks, and raspberry sound
#Expansion (3 to 8 months of age) isolated vowels, two or more vowels in a row, and squeals
#Basic canonical syllables (5 to 10 months of age) – a consonant vowel (CV) combination, often repeated (e.g. ba ba ba ba).
#Advanced forms (9 to 18 months of age) complex combinations of differing constant-vowel combinations (CVC) and jargon.

Typology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oller |first1=J. W. |last2=Oller |first2=S. D. |last3=Badon |first3=L. C. |year=2006 |title=Milestones: Normal Speech and Language Development Across the Life Span |publisher=Plural Publishing |location=San Diego }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages.  The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations.  Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing.  Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.

== Speech sound normative data ==

Knowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test.  This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers.  The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. 
Many norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Sander, E. K. (1972). When are speech sounds learned? Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 37(1), 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Templin (1957),&lt;ref&gt;Templin, M. (1957). Certain language skills in children: Their development and interrelationships. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Wellman, Case, Mengert, &amp; Bradbury, (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, B., Case, I., Mengert, I., &amp; Bradbury, D. (1931). Speech sounds of young children. University of Iowa Study, Child Welfare, 5(2), 1–82.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/ASHA/Practice_Portal/Clinical_Topics/Late_Language_Emergence/Consonant-Acquisition-Chart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early, Middle, and Late 8s===

Shriberg (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/jshr.3601.105 |pmid=8450654 |title=Four New Speech and Prosody-Voice Measures for Genetics Research and Other Studies in Developmental Phonological Disorders |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=105–40 |year=1993 |last1=Shriberg |first1=Lawrence D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of "consonant mastery" he developed the following:

* Early 8 – /m, b, j, n, w, d, p, h/
* Middle 8 – /t, ŋ, k, g, f, v, tʃ, dʒ/
* Late 8 – /ʃ, θ, s, z, ð, l, r, ʒ/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

'''Tongue thrust''' (also called '''reverse swallow''' or '''immature swallow''') is the common name of '''orofacial muscular imbalance''', a human behavioral pattern in which the [[tongue]] protrudes through the anterior [[incisors]] during [[swallowing]], during [[Manner of articulation|speech]], and while the tongue is at rest. Nearly all infants exhibit a swallowing pattern involving tongue protrusion, but by six months of age most lose this reflex allowing for the ingestion of solid foods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educus.com/Journals/16818591&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1958, the term "tongue thrust" has been described and discussed in speech and dental publications by many writers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Many school-age children have tongue thrust. For example, according to recent&lt;!--soon won't be recent: give timeframe--&gt; literature, as many as 67–95 percent of children 5–8 years old exhibit tongue thrust, which may be associated with or contributing to an [[orthodontics|orthodontic]] or speech problem. Up to the age of four, there is a possibility that the child will outgrow tongue thrust. However, if the tongue thrust swallowing pattern is retained beyond that age, it may be strengthened.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

{| class="wikitable"
|+Types
!Name
!Definition
|-
|Anterior open bite
|The most common type of tongue thrust. In this case, the front lips do not close and the child often has his mouth open with the tongue protruding beyond the lips.
|-
|Anterior thrust
|Upper incisors are extremely protruded and the lower incisors are pulled in by the lower lip. This type of thrust is most generally accompanied by a strong [[mentalis]].
|-
|Unilateral thrust
|The bite is characteristically open on either side.
|-
|Bilateral thrust
|The anterior bite is closed, but the posterior teeth from the first [[bicuspid]] to the back [[molars]] may be open on both sides. This is the most difficult thrust to correct.
|-
|Bilateral anterior open bite
|The only teeth that touch are the molars, with the bite completely open on both sides including the anterior teeth. A large tongue is also noted.
|-bimaxillary protrusion (Closed bite thrust)
|Bimaxillary Thrust (closed bite thrust)
|Typically shows a double protrusion meaning that both the upper and lower teeth are flared out and spread apart
|}

== Causes ==
Factors that can contribute to tongue thrusting include [[macroglossia]] (enlarged tongue), [[thumb sucking]], large [[tonsils]], hereditary factors, [[ankyloglossia]] (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also [[allergies]] or [[nasal congestion]] can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics). &lt;!--Nothing about the relationship to bruxism?--&gt;

== Effects ==
Tongue thrust is normal in [[infant]]s until approximately the age of six months.  The loss of this normal infant behavior is one of the signs that the baby is ready to begin eating [[baby food]].

Tongue thrusting can adversely affect the teeth and mouth. A person swallows from 1,200 to 2,000 times every 24 hours with about four pounds (1.8&amp;nbsp;kg) of pressure each time. If a person suffers from tongue thrusting, this continuous pressure tends to force the teeth out of alignment.  Many people who tongue thrust have [[open bite]]s;&lt;!--give technical term (malocclusion? or more precise?)--&gt; the force of the tongue against the teeth is an important factor in contributing to "bad bite" ([[malocclusion]]).  Many orthodontists have completed dental treatment with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case relapsed because of the patient's tongue thrust.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} If the tongue is allowed to continue its pushing action against the teeth, it will continue to push the teeth forward and reverse the orthodontic work.

Speech is not frequently affected by the tongue thrust swallowing pattern. The "S" sound ([[lisp]]ing) is the one most affected. The lateral lisp (air forced on the side of the tongue rather than forward) shows dramatic improvement when the tongue thrust is corrected. However, lisping and tongue thrust are not always associated.

==Treatment==
Treatment for uncontrolled tongue thrust requires habit retraining in conjunction with a dental appliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11597">[[Image:JO199411392.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The '''Toubon Law''' (full name: ''law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the [[French language]]'') is a law of the French government mandating the use of the [[French language]] in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See the text of the Toubon Law in English at [http://www.dglf.culture.gouv.fr/droit/loi-gb.htm La Délégation Générale à la Langue Française].&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting [[Commerce|commercial activity]]. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and "original version" films.&lt;ref name="OpenSociety"&gt;See [http://www.eumap.org/topics/media/television_europe/national/france/media_fra1.pdf Television Regulation in France] a 2005 report sponsored by the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast musical works are subject to [[Quota share|quota]] rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language.&lt;ref name=OpenSociety /&gt; 

The law takes its common name from [[Jacques Toubon]], who was [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the [[National Assembly of France]]. A nickname is ''Loi Allgood'' &amp;ndash; "Allgood" is a [[morpheme]]-for-morpheme translation of "Toubon" into [[English language|English]] ("All Good" being a translation of "Tout bon") &amp;ndash; as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also ‘came under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961967|title=Identity, insecurity and image : France and language|last=E.|first=Ager, D.|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=|isbn=1853594431|location=Clevedon, England|pages=44|oclc=44961967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the law==
One broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that "any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French." Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that "these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report on GE Medical Systems case: French court fines US company for not using French language in France|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html|archivedate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000006948282 Ruling] from the Versailles Court of Appeal, 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided.

A similar restriction—though implemented by [[primary legislation]] regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubon—applies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006292770 Code de la consommation R112-8]&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with [[Law of the European Union|European law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61998J0366:EN:NOT Ruling C-366-98 of 12 September 2000], [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the [[European Union]]. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Frangi, ''[http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-economique-2003-1-page-135.htm Le consommateur français entre loi Toubon et droit communautaire]'', Revue internationale de droit économique, De Boeck Université, t. XVII, 1 2003/1, pp. 135-144, {{ISBN|2-8041-4232-9}}, {{DOI|10.3917/ride.171.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another provision, the law specifies obligations for public [[Legal personality#Juridicial persons|legal persons]] (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French.

Under the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding. This excludes the [[Breton language]] schools of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Breton language]] for a summary of the Toubon Law's impact on the Breton language.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000008131414 Ruling 238653 of 29 November 2002] from the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]]: 50/50 French/Breton education cannot be publicly funded.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other restrictions concern the use of French in [[academic conference]]s. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the "hard" scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/1990/qSEQ901012253.html Question] from senator Danielle Bidard-Reydet and answer by the Minister of Research [[Hubert Curien]], 1991: the conclusion of a commission of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] is that enforcing the use of French in scientific conferences, through the use of simultaneous translations, would be not only costly but useless, and would damage the reputation of France among the international scientific community. The Ministry thus does not envision coercive measures, which would have the result of reducing the number of internal scientific conferences in France. Thus, the use of simultaneous translation is ''recommended'' (not impose).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/rapport/2008/Rapport_Parlement08.pdf 2008 Report from the General delegation to French language] to [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], pp. 33-39. The [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Centre for Scientific Research]] indicates that strict observance of the law would pose considerable problems. Page 39: 78% of research laboratories have organized or co-organized seminars, in France during the 2006-2007 school year. Out of that number, 62% organized sittings that took place essentially in a foreign language: 47% in humanities and social sciences, 71% in exact sciences. The operators indicated that sometimes sittings took place in a foreign language even though all participants were francophone. This situation took place within 35% of relevant laboratories (thus 16% of all laboratories), in approximately the same proportion in exact sciences and humanities and social sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/1994/94-345-dc/decision-n-94-345-dc-du-29-juillet-1994.10568.html 94-345 DC]&lt;/ref&gt; on grounds that they violated [[freedom of speech]], and the final form of the law was modified accordingly.

===Enforcement against French subsidiaries of US-based organizations===

In the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groups—the ''Association pour la Défense de la Langue Française'' and the ''L'Avenir de la Langue Française''—filed a complaint against [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]], the [[Metz]] campus of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial [[advertisement]] for the school's courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruno|last=Giussani|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/euro/1231euro.html|title=Georgia Tech Is Sued For Non-French Web Site|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-12-31|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/cyberia-l/msg01052.html|title=Victory in France|publisher=[[Findlaw]]|date=1997-06-09|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.georgiatech-metz.fr/ Georgia Tech Lorraine website today].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company [[General Electric|General Electric Medical Systems]] was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30045">'''Universal grammar''' ('''UG''') in [[linguistics]], is the theory of the [[genetics|genetic]] component of the [[language faculty]], usually credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of [[Grammar|structural rules]] are [[A priori and a posteriori|innate]] to humans, independent of [[sensory experience]]. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of [[psychological development]], children then adopt specific [[syntactic rule]]s that conform to UG.&lt;ref name="toolmodule2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky's Universal Grammar|author=Noam Chomsky|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes known as "mental grammar", and stands contrasted with other "grammars", e.g. [[Prescriptive grammar|prescriptive]], [[Descriptive grammar|descriptive]] and [[Pedagogical grammar|pedagogical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An A-Z of ELT|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=1-4050-7063-3|page=92|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04v382j|title=First Words: How do children develop language?|date=16 December 2014|work=BBC Radio 4|department=Word of Mouth|last1=Szendroi|first1=Kriszta|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on [[Poverty of the stimulus|the poverty of the stimulus]] (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural [[human languages]]. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |last2=Levinson |first2=Stephen C. |title=The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=26 October 2009 |volume=32 |issue=05 |pages=429-48 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999094X |pmid=19857320 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-myth-of-language-universals%3A-language-diversity-Evans-Levinson/1202032fc27b5da12362d82d48eed5e1c34c166f |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727171702/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f31/330319b363499ec974b27b7678d96025cde9.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.

== Argument ==
The theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme [[sensory deprivation]]), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing [[noun]]s from [[verb]]s, or distinguishing [[function word]]s from [[content word]]s). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/outil_rouge06.html|title=Tool Module: Chomsky’s Universal Grammar|website=thebrain.mcgill.ca|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.

As Chomsky puts it, "Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language."&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2007 |chapter=Approaching UG from Below |title=Interfaces + Recursion = Language? Chomsky's Minimalism and the View from Syntax-Semantics |series=Studies in Generative Grammar |editor=Hans-Martin Gärtner |editor2=Uli Sauerland |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-11-018872-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).

In the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: "How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).

Chomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term "UG" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:

"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is
appropriated from other systems."

In other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.

The distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).

Some students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called [[linguistic universal]]s, often in the form of "If X holds true, then Y occurs." These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.

Later linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and [[Richard Montague]], developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the [[argument from poverty of the stimulus]] to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist [[Lydia White]].

Syntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being "hard-wired" (Chomsky's [[principles and parameters]] approach), a [[logical consequence]] of a specific syntactic architecture (the [[GPSG|generalized phrase structure]] approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the [[systemic functional linguistics|functionalist]] approach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark C.

== Relation to the evolution of language ==

In an article titled, "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?"&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hauser | first = Marc | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = Noam | author2-link = Noam Chomsky | last3 = Fitch | first3 = William Tecumseh | author3-link = W. Tecumseh Fitch | title = The Faculty of Language:  What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | pages = 1569–1579 | date = 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | issue = 5598 | access-date = 28 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archive-date = 28 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.

The first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.
This means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.

The second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.

The third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans.&lt;ref name="Hauser" /&gt; This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.

== History ==
The idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to [[Roger Bacon]]'s observations in his {{circa|lk=no|1245}} ''[[Overview of Grammar]]'' and {{circa|lk=no|1268}} ''[[Grammatica Graeca|Greek Grammar]]'' that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century [[speculative grammar]]ians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for [[philosophical language]]s. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]], [[Hugh Blair]], [[James Burnett]], [[James Harris (grammarian)|James Harris]], and [[Adam Smith]]. The article on grammar in the first edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1771) contains an extensive section titled "Of Universal Grammar".

The idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the "[[linguistics wars]]".

During the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a [[behaviourist]] perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success.&lt;ref name=toolmodule&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said.  For example, when a child says "milk" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.&lt;ref&gt;Ambridge &amp; Lieven, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chomsky's theory ==

{{further|Language acquisition device|Generative grammar|X-bar theory|Government and binding|Principles and parameters|Minimalist program}}
Chomsky argued that the [[human brain]] contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as "universal grammar".

Speakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this [[poverty of stimulus]] means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/sasspdf/whatexactlyisUG.pdf|title=What exactly is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?|last=Northumbria University|first=Ewa Dąbrowska|date=|website=www.northumbria.ac.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like ''what'' cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:

: *"What did John meet a man who sold?"

Such expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Presence of creole languages ==

The presence of [[creole language]]s is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] controversial [[language bioprogram theory]]. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a [[pidgin]]. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a [[Creole language|creole]]. Unlike pidgins, creoles have [[native speaker]]s (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.

According to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], they uniformly express [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. [[Negative concord]] occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.

However, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar.&lt;ref name="Kam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson Kam | first1 = C.

Many researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of [[relexification]], which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.

== Criticisms ==
[[Geoffrey Sampson]] maintains that universal grammar theories are not [[falsifiable]] and are therefore [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. He argues that the grammatical "rules" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Geoffrey |year=2005 |title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate: Revised Edition |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-7385-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Jeffrey Elman]] argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, "worst-case" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an [[explanandum]] looking for theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James R. Hurford |chapter=Nativist and Functional Explanations in Language Acquisition |editor=I. M. Roca |title=Logical Issues in Language Acquisition |publisher=Foris Publications |location=Dordrecht, Holland and Providence, Rhode Island |year=1995 |page=88 |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/rocapaper.pdf |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morten H. Christiansen]] and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, "apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics".&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Morten H 2008"&gt;Christiansen, Morten H. and [[Chater, Nick]]. "Language as Shaped by the Brain". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 31.5 (2008): 489–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:
* Universal grammar has no coherent formulation and is indeed unnecessary.
* Universal grammar is in conflict with biology: it cannot have evolved by standardly accepted [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] evolutionary principles.
* There are no linguistic universals: universal grammar is refuted by abundant variation at all levels of linguistic organization, which lies at the heart of human faculty of language.&lt;ref name="Hinzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinzen |first=Wolfram |title=The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar |journal=Language Sciences |volume=34 |issue=5 |date=September 2012 |pages=635–649 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see [[Distributional hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Scott |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael |year=2001 |title=Testing the distributional hypothesis: The influence of context on judgements of semantic similarity |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |pages=611–616 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.104.7535}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker "ed" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like ''goed'' and ''eated'' and correct these errors over time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernández |first=Eva M. |author2=Helen Smith Cairns |title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England:  |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ ''similarity-based generalization'' strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.&lt;ref name="Yarlett"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yarlett |first=Daniel G. |last2=Ramscar |first2=Michael J. A. |year=2008 |title=Language Learning Through Similarity-Based Generalization|accessdate=June 10, 2014 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.393.7298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language acquisition]] researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit [[negative feedback]] that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like ''goed'' to ''went'' through repetitive failure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramscar |first=Michael |last2=Yarlett |first2=Daniel |year=2007 |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: A new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–960 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |pmid=21635323}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of [[fast mapping]], as many nativists assume.

In the domain of field research, the [[Pirahã language]] is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by [[Daniel Everett]]. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for [[recursion]], including [[Dependent clause|embedded clauses]], as well as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] and [[colour]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everett |first=Daniel L. |title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã: Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |date=August–October 2005 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |title=How Do You Say 'Disagreement' in Pirahã? |work=The New York Times |date=March 22, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/22/books/a-new-book-and-film-about-rare-amazonian-language.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |page=C1 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, et al., 2007 Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment [http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063250/http://stirling.kent.ac.uk/SE551/Week10/Nevins%20et%20al%202007%20Piraha%20Exceptionality.pdf |date=May 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was "no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either" and they provided "suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive
structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 2012 |first=Steven T. |last=Piantadosi |first2=Laura |last2=Stearns |first3=Daniel L. |last3=Everett |first4=Edward |last4=Gibson |title=A corpus analysis of Pirahã grammar: An investigation of recursion |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Piantadosi_et_al_2012_LSAtalk_Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, "universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCrum |first=Robert |title=Daniel Everett: 'There is no such thing as universal grammar |work=The Observer |date=March 24, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/25/daniel-everett-human-language-piraha |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasello]], a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that "although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Michael Tomasello|Tomasello]] |first=Michael |year=2008 |title=Origins of human communication |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51520-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Wholistic reference''' is reference to the whole—with respect to the context. In its strongest, unqualified form, '''the principle of wholistic reference''' is the [[proposition]] that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its [[non-logical symbol|non-logical]] or content terms, refers to the whole of its [[universe of discourse]]. According to this principle every proposition of [[number theory]], even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers.  The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.

[[George Boole]] (1815–1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]], and [[José Miguel Sagüillo|Sagüillo, José Miguel]], 2011. “The Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper”, ''History and Philosophy of Logic'' 32: 359–80.&lt;/ref&gt; he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference.  Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity – or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically – was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. ''The Laws of Thought.'' Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' 24 (2004): 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt; One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.

Similar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925).  Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|Corcoran, John]]. Principle of Wholistic Reference. ''Manuscrito'' 27 (2004): 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boole’s 1854 definition==
{{Quote|text=
In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse. |author=[[George Boole]]|source=&lt;ref&gt;Page 42: [[George Boole]]. 1854/2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">A '''writing circle''' is a group of like-minded writers needing support for their work, either through [[writing]] [[peer critiques]], [[workshops]] or [[Class (education)|classes]], or just encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruiz|first=F|title=What Is a Writing Circle?|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-a-writing-circle.htm|publisher=Wisegeek.net|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different types of writing circles or writing groups based on location, style of writing, or format.  Normally, the goal of a writing circle is to improve one's own craft by listening to the works and suggestions of others in the group.  It also builds a sense of community, and allows new writers to become accustomed to sharing their work.  Writing circles can be helpful inside and outside of the classroom.

==Function==
A writing circle brings writers from different walks of life together in one place to discuss their work in a workshop style setting.  Writers will be able to give feedback and hear suggestions from fellow writers.  It can build community in a classroom and help students gain public speaking cleans.  This workshop method could be used for any genre of writing (creative prose, poetry, etc.).

Writing circles can build a sense of community and help writers become more confident in their own work. They teach writers how give and receive constructive criticism enable them to learn from one another's mistakes and successes and appreciate different opinions and views. In some cases writing circles can be used a form of group therapy (Writing for healing).
