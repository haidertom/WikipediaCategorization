      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">In 1980, an '''International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organisations''' was organized by [[Communism|communist]] groups dissatisfied with the new leadership in [[China]] after the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the overthrow of the [[Gang of Four]]. Participants were:
*[[Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist)]]
*[[Leninist Group of Senegal]]
*[[Group for the Defense of Marxism–Leninism]] ([[Spain]])
*[[Mao Tse-Tung Circle]] ([[Denmark]])
*[[Marxist–Leninist Collective]] ([[United Kingdom|Britain]])
*[[Marxist–Leninist Proletarian Communist Organization]] ([[Italy]])
*[[Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile]]
*[[Reorganisation Committee CPI(ML)]]
*[[For the Proletarian International]] ([[France]])
*[[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]]
*[[Revolutionary Communist Union]] ([[Dominican Republic]])

The conference constituted a 'Revolutionary International Committee' (precursor to the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]]).

The '''Libyan hostage situation''' began on the morning of the [[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|murder of WPC Fletcher]], 17 April 1984 and lasted until 5 February 1985 (294 days). In accordance with the hostage release agreement, reporting on the incident was restricted until the fall of Gadaffi in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Timeline ==

'''March 1984'''

Four Libyan nationals were arrested on charges following explosions at Manchester and Heathrow airports in the UK and were remanded in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v87/ai_4679424/ Libya – statement by Larry Pressler in a session of the UN General Assembly on November 19, 1986], [[CBS]] Interactive Business Network Resource Library&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 April 1984'''

[[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|WPC Yvonne Fletcher]] was hit by a bullet from a burst of machine-gun fire from within the Libyan Peoples' Bureau (Libyan Embassy) in St James's Sq., London. She died shortly afterwards.

That evening, Doug Ledingham, the airport manager for British Caledonian Airways at Tripoli Universal Airport, Libya, was arrested by soldiers.

'''17 to 27 April'''

There was a standoff between the Libyan and British governments over the pursuit of who shot WPC Fletcher. The standoff resulted in the breaking of diplomatic relations by Britain with Libya, and the return to Libya under diplomatic immunity of the occupants of the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in London.  Rumours abounded at the time as to the fate of the person who is alleged to have fired the fatal shots from the Libyan People's Bureau. In 1986, a British businessman who had worked for Colonel Gaddafi's regime reported WPC Fletcher's killer had been hanged as soon as he returned to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/17/newsid_2488000/2488369.stm | title = Libyan embassy shots kill policewoman | date = 17 April 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the breaking of diplomatic relations with Libya, the British Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated by the British and ransacked by the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/27/newsid_2502000/2502565.stm | title = 1984: Libyan embassy siege ends | date =  27 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skeleton staff of British diplomats took up office in the Italian Embassy.

'''14–16 May 1984'''

Four further British men in Libya were rounded up and detained as hostages against the four arrested Libyan nationals in Britain by those claiming to be officials of the [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi regime]]. The men in order of capture were: Michael Berdinner, Alan Russell, Malcolm Anderson and Robin Plummer. At first, Allen Russell and Malcolm Anderson were held at a separate location where they were questioned and beaten. Ledingham, Berdinner and Plummer (Plummer in solitary confinement) were in the same facility, the Italian Mansion, a building approximately 400 yards distant from the Italian Embassy.

'''12 June 1984'''

A month after being taken hostage, the five men were allowed a meeting with the British Second Consul, George Anderson, who was able to offer only pastoral care and contact with home, but no suggestion of release. It was clear by this time, however, that the men were being held as hostages by one of Col Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, in defiance of international law. Return to their respective prisons was followed by little or no improvement in the hostages' circumstances.

'''19 July 1984'''

A second meeting with George Anderson resulted in all the hostages being put into one location, the Italian Mansion, and being fed an improved diet and given medical attention. This improvement in circumstances was accompanied by a slow but inexorable descent into gloom of the hostages isolated from all news of the outside world.

Meanwhile, in Britain, unbeknownst to the hostages, their families, notably Pat Plummer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Selena Scott]]|date= 3 September 1984|title= Selena Scott interviews Pat Plummer|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carole Russell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=October 1984 |title= After Carole's visit to Libya|medium= Television production|publisher=[[Anglia News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were working tirelessly with [[Kate Adie]] of the BBC and [[Brent Sadler]] of ITN to keep the hostages' plight in the media to keep the situation in the news and the profile high on the government's agenda. By now, the families were being kept up to date on a daily basis by contacts within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London as to the stalemate between Libya and Britain, with a continual decline in international relations between Libya and most of the rest of the world.

'''Summer 1984'''

In London, a committee in parliament was held to determine whether or not what the British government had done over the Libyan hostage situation was reasonable.  The committee concluded that in the circumstances, the British government had done all it reasonably could in the light of what little was known at the time.

'''7 August 1984'''

The Libyans allowed family members to visit the hostages.  These visits brought unofficial news of the, as yet, publicly undisclosed involvement of [[Terry Waite]], the Special Envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Waite]], ''Taken on Trust'', 1993, Hodder and Stoughton, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1 September 1984'''

Doug Ledingham and George Bush, another prisoner, arrested and detained on bona fide charges unrelated to the Libyan hostage situation, were freed and allowed home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=2 September 1984 |title= Doug Ledingham returns home, Pat Plummer insists the government do more|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of their release, British television news was granted access to and showed the world for the first time, detail of the hostage situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Brent Sadler]]|date=1 September 1984 |title= New moves could help the four Britons held in Libya and the two who come home tomorrow|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 October 1984'''

Two of the wives of the hostages, Pat Plummer and Carole Russell, attended a meeting with the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The two wives petitioned for a representative of the British Government to go to Libya and start negotiations for the release of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Tony Scase|date=17 October 1984 |title= Post meeting with Margaret Thatcher|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was soon followed by the arrival in Libya of Terry Waite.

'''21 October 1984'''

Alan Russell and Malcolm Anderson were removed from the Italian Mansion and taken to the Libyan courts, where they were charged with transporting state secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=21 October 1984 |title= Russell and Anderson charged with espionage|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10–18 November 1984'''

Terry Waite was in Libya. The hostage situation showed no signs of thawing, in spite of national and international efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the intervention at a pastoral level of Waite.

'''13–14 December 1984 '''

Allen Russell was placed on trial and charged with sharing state secrets with British journalists. Robin Plummer seized the opportunity to speak to the press post being question and states his innocence and makes a plea for warm clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=14 December 1984 |title= Wives plead to Gaddafi and Plummer pleas for warm clothes|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''24 December 1984'''

The four men were confirmed as political hostages by Gaddafi. Waite held a Christmas carol service with the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=24 December 1984 |title= A difficult Christmas|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6 January 1985'''

Col Gaddafi himself placed the matter of the remaining hostages before the members of the Basic and General Peoples' Congresses, the system of democracy prevalent in Libya at the time, for a decision on the release of the hostages.

'''1 February 1985'''

Then WPC Fletcher's memorial was unveiled temporarily disrupting negotiations and sent a very clear message to the Libyans.

'''5 February 1985'''

The Congresses voted by an overwhelming majority to release the hostages. But there were conditions to the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=5 February 1985 |title= Press Conference in Libya to release hostages|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release was however subject to a few days' delay, for undisclosed reasons.

'''7 February 1985'''

After almost nine months (294 days), the hostages arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=7 February 1985 |title= Former Hostages arrive at Gatwick|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions for release ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}

The conditions were as follows:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
#Britain should undertake not to support "stray dogs" (political exiles),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/28/politics.libya Gadaffi still hunts 'stray dogs' in UK], Martin Bright, ''[[The Observer]]'', Sunday 28 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} to hand them over, and to stop antagonistic acts against the Libyan people;
#British Government to work for release of the Libyan prisoners in the UK;
#The Anglican Church to undertake to look after Libyan students in Britain and to endeavour to secure release of Libyan prisoners;
#British Government to stop anti-Libyan propaganda channelled through British media;
#Her Majesty's Government to undertake to treat Libyans in accordance with international law.

== Aftermath ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
An interpretation of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of any reference to the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a breach of Condition 4. In accordance with this interpretation, there has been almost no reference to the hostage situation in literature since the time of the release. Most references that state the history of Libya at the time make reference to the murder of WPC Fletcher and then make no reference whatsoever to the hostage situation, skipping instead to the bombing of Libya by the Americans in 1986.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2576">A '''ballot measure''' is a piece of proposed [[legislation]] to be approved or rejected by eligible [[voter]]s. Ballot measures are also known as "propositions" or simply "questions".

Ballot measures differ from most legislation passed by [[representative democracies]]; ordinarily, an [[election|elected]] [[legislature]] develops and passes laws. Ballot measures, by contrast, are an example of [[direct democracy]].

In the [[United States]] ballot measures may be established by several different processes which vary amongst the states:&lt;ref&gt;[[Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute]] (2013). [http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I&amp;R.htm What are ballot propositions, initiatives, and referendums?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725175114/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I%26R.htm |date=2010-07-25 }}. USC.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Initiative]], in which any citizen or organization may gather a predetermined number of [[signature]]s to qualify a measure for the [[ballot]];
* [[Popular referendum]], in which a predetermined number of signatures (typically lower than the number required for an initiative) qualifies a ballot measure repealing a specific act of the legislature;
* [[Legislative referral]] (a.k.a. "legislative referendum"), in which the legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a [[constitutional amendment]] as a required procedure).
[[File:MedicaidForIdahoVan.jpg|thumb|A [[Initiative|initiative]] [[canvassing]] campaign, Medicaid for Idaho, to put [[Medicaid]] expansion on the ballot; the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Cathedral of the Rockies]] hosted the [[volunteering|volunteers&lt;ref name="In This Red State, Progressives Are Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-this-red-state-progressives-are-taking-matters-into-their-own-hands_us_5aadb598e4b0337adf8449fa |title=In This Red State, Progressives Are Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands Amateur activists, sick of being ignored by the GOP, are fighting to cover the uninsured. |last=Young |first=Jeffrey |date=2018-03-21 |website=Huffington Post |access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]]]

In [[Switzerland]], same kind of ballot measures are known as ''[[votations]]''.

'''''{{lang|la|Bellum omnium contra omnes}}''''', a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase meaning "the war of all against all", is the description that [[Thomas Hobbes]] gives to [[Human condition|human existence]] in the [[state of nature]] [[thought experiment]] that he conducts in ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642) and ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of "each against all" where war is rare and terms such as "competition" or "struggle" are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/71/0425.html|title=Each Against All|author=[[Charles Fourier]]|editor=[[Upton Sinclair]]| year=1915|edition=1st |work=[[Bartleby.com]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|[...] ''ostendo primo conditionem hominum extra societatem civilem, quam conditionem appellare liceat statum naturæ, aliam non esse quam bellum omnium contra omnes; atque in eo bello jus esse omnibus in omnia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22ostendo+primo+conditionem+hominum+extra+societatem+civilem,+quam+conditionem+appellare+liceat+statum+naturae,+aliam+non+esse+quam+bellum+omnium+contra+omnes+;+atque+in+eo+bello+jus+esse+omnibus+in+omnia%22 ''Præefatio'' ("Preface")].&lt;/ref&gt;

I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22I+demonstrate+in+the+first+place,+that+the+state+of+men+without+civil+society+(which+state+we+may+properly+call+the+state+of+nature)+is+nothing+else+but+a+mere+war+of+all+against+all;+and+in+that+war+all+men+have+equal+right+unto+all+things%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later on, two slightly modified versions are presented in [[De Cive|''Libertas'' (liberty)]]:
{{Quote|[...] ''Status hominum naturalis antequam in societatem coiretur, bellum fuerit; neque hoc simpliciter, sed bellum omnium in omnes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{la icon}} [https://books.google.com/?id=YcyX3dTKfBIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22status+hominum+naturalis+antequam+in+societatem+coiretur,+bellum+fuerit;+neque+hoc+simpliciter,+sed+bellum+omnium%22%22in+omnes%22 Chapter 1, section 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural state of men, before they entered into society, was a mere war, and that not simply, but a war of all men against all men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor%3A%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22The+natural+state+of+men,+before+they+entered+into+society,+was+a+mere+war,+and+that+not+simply,+but+a+war+of+all+men+against+all+men%22 English translation] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In chapter XIII of ''Leviathan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html |title=Chapter XIII - Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery |author=Thomas Hobbes |date= |work=bartleby.com |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes explains the concept with these words:
{{Quote|Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war as is of every man against every man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22Hereby+it+is+manifest+that+during+the+time+men+live+without+a+common+Power+to+keep+them+all+in+awe,+they+are+in+that+condition+which+is+called+War;+and+such+a+war+as+is+of+every+man+against+every+man%22 Occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] In such condition there is no place for Industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual Fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22%22In+such+condition+there+is+no+place+for+Industry,+because+the+fruit+thereof+is+uncertain:+and+consequently+no+Culture+of+the+Earth;+no+Navigation,+nor+use+of+the+commodities+that+may+be+imported+by+Sea;+no+commodious+Building;+no+Instruments+of+moving+and+removing+such+things+as+require+much+force;+no+Knowledge+of+the+face+of+the+Earth;+no+account+of+Time;+no+Arts;+no+Letters;+no+Society;+and+which+is+worst+of+all,+continual+Fear,+and+danger+of+violent+death;+And+the+life+of+man+solitary,+poor,+nasty,+brutish,+and+short%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The thought experiment places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to enter a [[social contract]], giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimation]] of a [[Sovereign state|state]] in fulfilling its role as "[[sovereignty|sovereign]]" to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.

Hobbes distinguishes between war and battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation in which one knows there is a 'Will to contend by Battle'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Thomas+Hobbes%22+Leviathan+%22Will+to+contend+by+Battle%22 ''Ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later uses==
In his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785) [[Thomas Jefferson]] uses the phrase ''bellum omnium in omnia'' ("war of all things against all things," assuming ''omnium'' is intended to be neuter like ''omnia'') as he laments that the constitution of that state was twice at risk of being sacrificed to the nomination of a [[dictator]] after the manner of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes on the State of Virginia|author=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher=Lilly and Wait | location=Boston| year=1832|page=[https://books.google.com/?id=FlEVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22ad+libitum+into+any+other+form+of+government+for+precedents+to+rule+us+by,+for+what+oppression+may+not+a+precedent+be+found+in+this+world+of+the+bellum+omnium+in+omnia?%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the Jewish-Palestinian ideological movement|ancient Canaanite polytheism|Canaanite religion}}
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
{{Israelis}}
'''Canaanism''' was a cultural and ideological movement founded in 1939 that reached its peak in the 1940s among the [[Jews]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It has had significant effect on the course of Israeli art, [[Israeli literature|literature]] and spiritual and political thought. Its adherents were called '''Canaanites''' ({{lang-he-n|כנענים}}). The movement's original name was the ''Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth'' ({{Hebrew|הוועד לגיבוש הנוער העברי}}); "Canaanism" was originally a pejorative term. It grew out of [[Revisionist Zionism]] and according to Ron Kuzar had "its early roots in [[Far-right politics|European extreme right-wing]] movements, notably [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kuzar 107, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; which was not anti-Semitic like [[Nazism|German national socialism]]. Most of its members were part of the [[Irgun]] or [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"&gt;Kuzar 13&lt;/ref&gt; Canaanism never had more than around two dozen registered members, but because most of these were influential intellectuals and artists, the movement had an influence far beyond its size,&lt;ref name="kuzar107"&gt;Kuzar 197&lt;/ref&gt; Its members believed that much of the Middle East had been a Hebrew-speaking civilization in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"&gt;Kuzar 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzar also says they hoped to revive this civilization, creating a "Hebrew" nation, disconnected from the Jewish past, which would embrace the Middle East's Arab population as well.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"/&gt;  They saw both "world Jewry and world Islam" as backward and medieval; Ron Kuzar writes that the movement "exhibited an interesting blend of militarism and power politics toward the Arabs as an organized community on the one hand and a welcoming acceptance of them as individuals to be redeemed from medieval darkness on the other."&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"/&gt;

==The Canaanites and Judaism==
The movement was founded in 1939. In 1943 the Jewish-Palestinian poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] published an "Epistle to the Hebrew Youth", the first manifesto of the Canaanites. In this tract, Ratosh called upon Hebrew youth to disaffiliate themselves from [[Judaism]], and declared that no meaningful bond united Hebrew youth residing in Palestine and Judaism. Ratosh argued that Judaism was not a [[nation]] but a [[religion]], and as such it was universal, without territorial claims; one could be Jewish anywhere. For a nation to genuinely arise in Palestine, he maintained, the youth must uncouple from Judaism and form a [[Hebrew]] nation with its own unique identity. (The term "Hebrew" had been associated with the Zionist aspiration to create a strong, self-confident "new Jew" since the late nineteenth century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Tom|author2=Haim Watzman|title=Elvis in Jerusalem: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel  |publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|pages=26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCAk-6zJIC8C&amp;pg=PA26 | isbn=978-0-8050-7288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shavit xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  The birthplace and geographical coordinates of this nation is the [[Fertile Crescent]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth calls upon you as a Hebrew, as one for whom the Hebrew homeland is a homeland in actuality: not as vision, nor as desire; and not as solution for the Jewish question, nor as solution to cosmic questions, and not as solution to the variegated neuroses of those stricken by the diaspora. As one for whom the Hebrew language is a language in actuality and practicality, a mother tongue, a language of culture and of the soul; the one and only language for emotion and thought. As one whose character and intellect were determined in the Hebrew reality, whose internal landscape is the landscape of the nation and whose past is the past of the nation alone. As one who, despite the best efforts of rootless parents, teachers, statesmen and religious leaders, could not be made to like and affiliate with the [[Shtetl]] and the history of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the pogroms and expulsions and martyrs, and whose natural estrangement from all prophets of Zionism, the fathers of Jewish Literature in the Hebrew tongue, and the diaspora mentality and the diaspora problem, cannot be expunged. Whereas all these were conferred upon you by force, like a borrowed cloth, faded and tattered and too-tight.&lt;ref name="epistle"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Ratosh
  | first = Yonatan
  | title = Ktav el hanoar haivri
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of their estrangement from Judaism the Canaanites were also estranged from [[Zionism]]. The [[Israel|State of Israel]] ought to be, they argued, a [[Jewish state|Hebrew state]], not a solution to the [[Jewish Question]]. Following the first [[Aliyah|Aliyot]], a generation arose in Palestine that spoke Hebrew as a native language and did not always identify with Judaism. Designating the Israeli People as a "Jewish People", the Canaanites argued, was misleading. If it was possible to be a Jew anywhere, then the State of Israel was merely an anecdote in the [[history of Judaism]]. A nation must be rooted in a territory and a language—things which Judaism, in its very nature, could not provide.

==Canaanites and history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The movement promoted the idea that the [[Land of Israel]] was that of ancient [[Canaan]] (or, according to others, the whole of the [[Fertile Crescent]]) in which ancient peoples and cultures had lived, and that the historical occasion of the reemergence of an Israeli people constituted a veritable revival of these selfsame ancient Hebrews and their civilization, and consequently a rejection of religious Judaism in favor of a native and rooted Hebrew identity.

Because the Canaanites sought to create in Israel a new people, they mandated the dissociation of [[Israelis]] from Judaism and the history of Judaism. In their stead they placed the culture and history of the [[Ancient Near East]], which they considered the true historical reference. They argued that the people of the Land of Israel in the days of the biblical monarchs had not been [[Jews|Jewish]] but [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], and had shared a cultural context with other peoples of the region. Citing contemporary [[biblical criticism]], the Canaanites argued that the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] reflected this ancient history, but only partly, since it had been compiled in the period of the [[Second Temple]] by Jewish [[Scribe|scribes]] who had rewritten the history of the region to suit their world-view.

Much of the Canaanite effort was dedicated to researching the history of the [[Middle East]] and its peoples. The Canaanites cited approvingly the work of [[Umberto Cassuto]], who translated [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] poetry into Hebrew. ([[Ugarit]] was an ancient city located in modern-day northern [[Syria]], where in the early 20th century many important ancient texts, written in the [[Ugaritic language]], were discovered.) Ugaritic verse bore an uncanny resemblance to the language of the [[Tanakh]]. The Canaanites argued that these texts proved that the people of the [[Land of Israel]] had been much closer socially and culturally to other peoples of the region than they had been to Judaism.

==Canaanites and literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In his book, ''Sifrut Yehudit ba-lashon ha-ʻIvrit'' (Jewish Literature in the Hebrew Tongue), Yonatan Ratosh sought to differentiate between [[Hebrew literature]] and [[Jewish literature]] written in the [[Hebrew language]]. Jewish literature, Ratosh claimed, could be and was written in any number of languages. The ideas and writing style that characterize Jewish literature in Hebrew were not substantially different from those of Jewish literature in other languages. Ratosh and his fellow Canaanites (especially [[Aharon Amir]]) thought that Hebrew literature should be rooted to its historical origins in the [[Land of Israel]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. As an example they noted American literature, which in their mind was newly created for the new American people.

Canaanite verse is often obscure to those unfamiliar with ancient Ugaritic and [[Canaanite mythology]]. One of the principal techniques used by the Canaanites to produce Hebrew literature was to adopt words and phrases (especially [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]], which the Canaanites regarded as traces of the original unedited Hebraic Tanakh) from the Tanakh, and use them in a poetic that approximated [[Biblical poetry|biblical]] and Ugaritic verse, especially in their use of repetitive structures and [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. The Canaanites did not rule out the use of new Hebrew words, but many of them did avoid [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew. However, these characteristics represent only the core of the Canaanite movement, and not its full breadth.

The late literary scholar [[Baruch Kurzweil]] argued that the Canaanites were not ''[[sui generis]]'', but a direct continuation (albeit a radical one) of the literature of [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Canaanites and language==
Ratosh and his brother, [[Uzzi Ornan]], also sought for the [[Romanization of Hebrew]] in order to further divorce the language from the older [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Writing articles in the Hebrew-language press in the 1960s and 1970s, they criticized the Hebrew alphabet for its graphical shortcomings and relationship with Judaism, and proposed for official Romanization of the language in order to further free secular Hebrew Israelis from the hold of religion and integrate them into the larger [[Levant|Levantine region]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Diamond, Homeland or Holy Land?

(University of Texas Press) pp. 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aytürk later compared the Canaanite proposal for Romanization to the more successful reform of the [[Turkish alphabet]] [[Atatürk's Reforms|as undertaken by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]]; the reform of Turkish spelling, which had previously been written in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]-based [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] for over 1,000 years until the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], was similarly motivated by Atatürk's attempts to secularize and modernize post-Ottoman Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk, "Script Charisma in Hebrew and Turkish: A Comparative Framework for Explaining Success and Failure of Romanization," Journal of World History, Volume 21, Number 1, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The Coalition published a journal, ''[[Aleph]]'', which ran from 1948-1953, featuring the works of several luminaries of the movement including Ratosh, [[Adia Horon]], [[Uzzi Ornan]], [[Amos Kenan]] and [[Benjamin Tammuz]]. It was edited by [[Aharon Amir]], and the journal circulated erratically throughout its existence.

The history of the Coalition and the movement was fraught with controversy and opposition. In 1951, leaflets were distributed by self-identified Canaanites in opposition to Zionism during the [[World Zionist Congress]] in Jerusalem that year. Later that year, the Coalition was formally organized at a conference of ideologues, but the permit to formally register as an NGO was deliberately delayed by the Interior Ministry; the ministry's representative explained that the approval has been delayed because "the group did not complete the standard inquiry of the granting of approvals for political societies". The group claimed as many as 500 members at its height, although outside commentators only assessed the membership at around 100.

After the arrest of Amos Kenan in June 1952 on suspicion of throwing a bomb onto the doorstep of [[David-Zvi Pinkas]], newspaper editorials were lodged against the Canaanite movement and its members. The Coalition claimed to have no connection to Kenan or his act, and both Amir and Ratosh filed a [[defamation|libel suit]] against [[Isaiah Bernstein]] of ''[[HaTzofe]]'' and [[Ezriel Carlebach]] from ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' on behalf of the Coalition, but the suit was rejected for technical reasons.

In the 1960s, the movement's members participated in group discussions called "Hebrew Thought Clubs" and issued a booklet of their discussions as "the first claw." Among participants in the discussions were also identified individuals who were Canaanites, as [[Rostam Bastuni]], an Israeli Arab who was a member of the second Knesset for Mapam, and [[Yehoshua Palmon]].

==Scope and influence==
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|''Nimrod'' (1939) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]], a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea.]]
The political influence of the Canaanites was limited, but their influence on literary and intellectual life in Israel was great. Among the avowed Canaanites were the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] and thinkers such as [[Edya Horon]]. A series of articles which Horon published in the journal "Keshet" in 1965 were compiled after his death into a book and published in 2000. These articles constituted political and cultural manifestos that sought to create a direct connection between [[Semitic culture]] from the second millennium BCE and contemporary Israeli culture, relying on advancements in the fields of [[archeology]] and research of [[Semitic languages]] in [[linguistics]].

Some of the artists who took after the movement were the sculptor [[Yitzhak Danziger]] (whose ''Nimrod'' became a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea), novelist [[Benjamin Tammuz]], writer [[Amos Kenan]], novelist and translator [[Aharon Amir]], thinker and linguist [[Uzzi Ornan]] and many others.

The journalist [[Uri Avnery]] praised Horon's journal ''[[Shem]]'' in 1942 but did not subscribe to Ratosh's orthodoxy; in 1947 he derided the Canaanites as [[Romanticism|romantic]], anachronistic, and divorced from reality.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 135-37, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the influence of Canaanism is still evident in some of his political thought, such as his 1947 proposal for a pan-Semitic union of Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Avnery, along with several former Canaanites (notably Kenan and [[Boaz Evron]]) later changed positions drastically, becoming advocates for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;  Israeli leftists and secularists are sometimes accused of Canaanism or Canaanite influence by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 20: "Some observers, very ironically, still find strong echoes of Canaanite ideology in what they consider anti-religious and leftist political opinions".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalterraincognita.blogspot.nl/2008/03/terra-incognita-26-jewish-tourism.html "Jewish tourism, mexican racism and canaanism,"] Terra Incognita, Issue 26, A Publication of Seth J.

The idea of creating a new people in Palestine different from the Jewish life in the diaspora which preceded it never materialized in purist Canaanite conception, but nevertheless had a lasting effect on the self-understanding of many spheres of Israeli public life.

==Criticism==
The Canaanite movement, since soon after its inception, has met with heavy criticism. In 1945 [[Nathan Alterman]] published the poem "Merivat Kayitz" (later included in the collection ''Yr HaYona'', published in 1958), which took issue with the central tenets of the Canaanite movement. Alterman and others claimed that so many years in the diaspora cannot be simply expunged. Alterman argued that no one should coerce the Jewish settlement to adopt an identity; its identity will be determined through its experience in time.

Ratosh responded with an article in 1950 in which he claimed that Alterman was dodging important questions about Israeli identity. He argued that a return to ancient Hebrew traditions is not only feasible but necessary.

Alterman was not the only person to speak out against the Canaanites. Among the important critics of the movement was [[Baruch Kurzweil]], who published ''The Roots and Quintessence of the 'Young Hebrews' Movement'' in 1953, which analyzed and sharply criticized Canaanite ideas. Kurzweil argued that the Canaanite ambition to motivate the variegated ethnography of the region in a single direction was not as easy as the Canaanites believed. Kurzweil believed the Canaanites replaced [[logos]] with [[Mythology|mythos]], producing a religious delusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth.

The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a return to the lap of myth.  The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]]: "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos."&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article Kurzweil argues that, if no viable alternative was found, the Canaanite movement might become the leading political ideology in Israel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">A '''candlelight vigil''' or '''candlelit vigil''' is an outdoor [[Popular assembly|assembly]] of people carrying [[candle]]s, held after [[sunset]] in order to show support for a specific cause.&lt;ref name=lovetoknow&gt;{{cite web|title=love to know: Organise a candlelight vigil|url=http://candles.lovetoknow.com/How_to_Organize_a_Candlelight_Vigil|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such events are typically held either to protest the suffering of some marginalized group of people, or in memory of the dead. In the latter case, the event is often called a '''candlelight memorial'''. A large candlelight vigil will usually have invited speakers with a [[public address system]] and may be covered by local or national [[News media|media]]. Speakers give their speech at the beginning of the vigil to explain why they are holding a vigil and what it represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Something: how to organise a vigil|url=http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/organize-a-candlelight-vigil-your-cause-0|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vigil]]s may also have a religious or spiritual purpose. On Christmas Eve many churches hold a candlelight vigil.

Candlelight vigils are seen as a nonviolent way to raise awareness of a cause and to motivate change, as well as uniting and supporting those attending the vigil.&lt;ref name=lovetoknow /&gt;

'''Catholic Church and politics''' aims to cover subjects of where the [[Catholic Church]] and [[politics]] share common ground.

==Background==
According to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "the separation of church and state does not require division between belief and public action, between moral principles and political choices, but protects the right of believers and religious groups to practice their faith and act on their values in public life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/faithful-citizenship/church-teaching/catholics-in-political-life.cfm "Catholics in Political Life", United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
As a program and a movement, political Catholicism - a political and cultural conception which promotes the ideas and social teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] (''[[Catholic social teaching]]'') in public life through government action - was started by [[Prussia]]n Catholics in the second half of the 19th century, as a response to [[secular]] social concepts. The main reason were the measures by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] to limit the influence of Catholic Church, first in Prussia, and then in united Germany. That struggle is known in history as the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.

From Germany, political Catholic social movements spread in [[Austria-Hungary]], especially in today's Austria, [[Christian Social Movement in Ukraine|Ukraine]], Slovenia and [[Croatian Catholic movement|Croatia]]. [[Catholic Action]] was the name of many groups of [[Laity|lay]] Catholics who were attempting to encourage a Catholic influence on political society.

After the 1891 [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ''(Of New Things)'' by [[Pope Leo XIII]], political Catholic movements got a new impulse for development, and they spread the area of their involvement. With this encyclical, the Catholic Church expanded its interest in social, economical, political and cultural issues, and it called for a drastic conversion of Western society in the 19th century in the face of [[capitalist]] influences. Following the release of the document, the [[labour movement]] which had previously floundered began to flourish in Europe and later in North America. Catholic believers, both lay and clergy alike, had a desire for active social and political engagement in order to deal with acute social problems according to Catholic Christian principles, as opposed to a purely secular approach.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} For example, [[Mary Harris Jones]], better known as "Mother Jones", and the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were central in the campaign to end [[child labour]] in the [[United States]] during the early 20th century.

==Catholic movements in the 20th century==
{{more citations needed|date=July 2013}}

In the 20th century, Catholic political movements became very strong in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Ireland, France and Latin America. What these movements had in common was a defense of the acquired rights of the Catholic Church (attacked by [[anticlerical]] politicians) and a defense of Christian faith and moral values (threatened by increasing [[secularization]]).  Members of opposing schools of thought called such attempts [[clericalism]].

These Catholic movements developed various forms of [[Christian democratic]] ideology, generally promoting a morally and socially conservative agenda whilst supporting a middle ground third way between unrestrained capitalism and state socialism.  [[Freemasons]] were seen mainly as enemies and vehement opponents of political Catholicism. A special situation occurred in Mexico, where an atheistic president ruled in the 1920s and oppressed the Church and Catholics.  This led to the open Christian revolution of 1926 to 1929, known as the [[Cristero War]].

Some of the earliest important political parties were:

*[[Conservative Catholic Party of Switzerland]] – 1848;
*[[Catholic Party (Belgium)]] – 1869;
*[[Centre Party (Germany)]] – with origins in 1870;
*[[Christian Social Party (Austria)]] – 1893;
*[[Popular Liberal Action]] in France – 1901;
*[[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] ([[Netherlands]]) – 1904, transformed into the [[Roman Catholic State Party]] in 1926;
*[[Slovak People's Party]] – 1918;
*[[Croatian Popular Party (1919)|Croatian Popular Party]] – 1919;
*[[Italian People's Party (1919–1926)|Italian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] – 1919;
*[[Bavarian People's Party]] – 1919;
*[[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]] in Mexico – 1924.
*[[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)]] - 1955

Most of these parties in Europe joined together in [[White International]] (1922). [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s mixture of Catholicism and nationalism received its own brand of [[National Catholicism]] and it inspired similar movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Payne1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=Spanish Catholicism: An Historical Overview|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGoqcg22N4gC&amp;pg=PR13|year=1984|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-09804-9|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to political parties, Catholic/Christian [[trade unions]] were created, which fought for [[worker's rights]]: the earliest include:

*[[Typographic Workers Trade Union]] in Spain (1897);
*[[Solidarity (South African trade union)|Solidarity]] in South Africa (1902);
*[[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] in Belgium (1904);
*[[Catholic Workers Union]] in  Mexico (1908);
*[[International Federation of Christian Trade Unions]] (IFCTO), in The Hague in 1920 (which was preceded by the [[International Secretariat of Christian Trade Unions]] founded in Zürich in 1908, led through the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) to today's [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC));
*[[French Confederation of Christian Workers]] (1919);
*[[Luxembourg Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (1921);
*[[Canadian Catholic Federation of Labour]] (1921)
*[[Young Christian Workers]] in Belgium (1924);
*[[Catholic Worker Movement]] in the USA (from 1933).

After World War II, more unions were formed, including:

*[[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions]] (from 1950);
*[[Christian Trade Union Federation of Germany]] (from 1959);
*[[Christian Workers' Union]] in Belize (from 1963);
*[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in Poland (from 1980).

Until the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Church did not always accept the model of modern democracy and its expansion into social and economic realms because it was wary of anticlerical socialistic tendencies. When Catholic social activists were perceived to be too extreme in social conflicts, the Church hierarchy tried to stop their excesses; occasions of this included the [[Worker-priest]] movement in France in the 1940s and 1950s, and [[liberation theology]] in Latin America in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. But some movements were strongly supported by the Church - in Australia the [[Catholic Social Studies Movement]] during the 1940s and 1950s, from which the [[National Civic Council]] has developed.

Catholic clergy and lay activists sometimes tended to support far-right leaders such [[Francisco Franco]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], as well as the military regimes in [[Latin America]]. As a result, many workers involved in the [[labor movement]] joined [[social democratic]] and [[communist]] parties, which were sometimes secular and called for revolution against old values, which included religion and the Church.

In recent times, after the Second World War, Christian engagement in politics became weaker and even "Demo-Christian" parties by name lost some of their Christianity. Stronger Christian involvement in Europe on the beginning of the 21st century has produced some new small parties, for example those joined in the [[European Christian Political Movement]]. According to ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist [[Ross Douthat]], part of the younger generation of Catholics are now showing a renewed interest in forms of political Catholicism such as a revived [[Integralism#Catholic Integralism|Catholic Integralism]] or [[Tradinista!]] socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Douthat, Ross (October 8, 2016).

The '''Clash of Civilizations''' is a hypothesis that people's [[cultural identity|cultural]] and [[Religious identity|religious]] [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world. The American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that [[Islamic extremism]] would become the biggest threat to world peace. It was proposed in a 1992 lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy – Economics |publisher=AEI |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?",&lt;ref name="FAarticle"&gt;Official copy (free preview): [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1993-06-01/clash-civilizations The Clash of Civilizations?], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1993&lt;/ref&gt; in response to his former student [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.

The phrase itself was earlier used by [[Albert Camus]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|le problème russo-américain, et là nous revenons à l’Algérie, va être dépassé lui-même avant très peu, cela ne sera pas un choc d’empires nous assistons au choc de civilisations et nous voyons dans le monde entier les civilisations colonisées surgir peu à peu et se dresser contre les civilisations colonisatrices.}} http://www.ina.fr/audio/PHD85011203&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Girilal Jain]] in his analysis of the [[Ayodhya dispute]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Elst K., Some recollections from my acquaintance with Sita Ram Goel in Elst, K.

Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations (1996), p. 246: " 'La premiere guerre civilisationnelle' the distinguished Moroccan scholar Mahdi Elmandjra called the Gulf War as it was being fought."&lt;/ref&gt;. Even earlier, the phrase appears in a 1926 book regarding the Middle East by Basil Mathews: ''Young Islam on Trek:  A Study in the Clash of Civilizations'' (p.&amp;nbsp;196). This expression derives from "clash of cultures", already used during the colonial period and the [[Belle Époque]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Massignon, ''La psychologie musulmane'' (1931), in Idem, ''Ecrits mémorables'', t. I, Paris, Robert Laffont, 2009, p. 629: "Après la venue de Bonaparte au Caire, le ''clash of cultures'' entre l'ancienne Chrétienté et l'Islam prit un nouvel aspect, par invasion (sans échange) de l'échelle de valeurs occidentales dans la mentalité collective musulmane."&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post-Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]], and the capitalist free market economy had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post-Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]] argued that the world had reached the '[[end of history]]' in a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] sense.

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had only reverted to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/mehbaliyev/rashad-mehbaliyev-civilizations-their-nature-and-clash-possibilities|title=Civilizations, their nature and clash possibilities (c) Rashad Mehbal…|first=|last=mehbaliyev|date=30 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an extension, he posits that the concept of different [[civilization]]s, as the highest rank of [[cultural identity]], will become increasingly useful in analyzing the potential for conflict. At the end of his 1993 ''Foreign Affairs'' article, "The Clash of Civilizations?", Huntington writes, "This is not to advocate the desirability of conflicts between civilizations. It is to set forth descriptive hypothesis as to what the future may be like."&lt;ref name="FAarticle"/&gt;

In addition, the clash of civilizations, for Huntington, represents a development of history. In the past, world history was mainly about the struggles between monarchs, nations and ideologies, such as seen within Western civilization. But after the end of the [[Cold War]], world politics moved into a new phase, in which non-Western civilizations are no longer the exploited recipients of Western civilization but have become additional important actors joining the West to shape and move world history.&lt;ref&gt;Murden S. Cultures in world affairs. In: Baylis J, Smith S, Owens P, editors. The Globalization of World Politics. 5th ed. New York: Oxford University Press; 2011. p. 416-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major civilizations according to Huntington==
[[File:Clash of Civilizations mapn2.png|thumb|center|750px|The clash of civilizations according to Huntington (1996), as presented in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm THE WORLD OF CIVILIZATIONS: POST-1990] scanned image {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312101415/http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Huntington divided the world into the "major civilizations" in his thesis as such:
* [[Western world|Western]] civilization, comprising the United States and Canada, Western and Central Europe, Australia and Oceania. Whether Latin  America and the [[Post-Soviet states|former member states]] of the Soviet Union are included, or are instead their own separate civilizations, will be an important future consideration for those regions, according to Huntington. The traditional Western viewpoint identified Western Civilization with the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-[[Protestantism|Protestant]]) countries and culture.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22western+christianity%22+%22western+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3US_UfOUN9D04QTElIHwDQ&amp;ved=0CCUQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1800%2Ccd_max%3A1960&amp;tbm=bks|title="western christianity" "western world" - Google Search|website=google.com|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Latin America]]n. Includes Central America, South America (excluding [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]]), [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Mexico]]. May be considered a part of Western civilization. Many people in [[South America]] and [[Mexico]] regard themselves as full members of Western civilization (especially [[White Latin Americans]]).
* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] world of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and [[Romania]].
** Countries with a non-Orthodox majority are usually excluded e.g. Muslim [[Azerbaijan]] and Muslim [[Albania]] and most of [[Central Asia]], as well as majority Muslim regions in the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]] and central Russian regions such as [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkortostan]], Roman Catholic [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], Protestant and Catholic [[Baltic states]]). However, [[Armenia]] is included, despite its dominant faith, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], being a part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] rather than the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[Kazakhstan]] is also included, despite its dominant faith being [[Sunni Islam]].
* The [[Eastern world]] is the mix of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Greater China|Chinese]], [[Hindu]], and [[Japan|Japonic]] civilizations.
** The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] areas of [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]] are identified as separate from other civilizations, but Huntington believes that they do not constitute a major civilization in the sense of international affairs.
** The [[Confucianism|Confucian]] civilization of China, the [[Korea]]s, [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Vietnam]]. This group also includes the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]], especially in relation to Southeast Asia.
** Hindu civilization, located chiefly in [[India]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Nepal]], and culturally adhered to by the global [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]].
** [[Japan]], considered a hybrid of Chinese civilization and older [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] patterns.
* The [[Muslim world]] of the [[Greater Middle East]] (excluding [[Armenia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Israel]], [[Malta]] and [[South Sudan]]), northern [[West Africa]], [[Albania]], [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brunei]], [[Comoros]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]]  and [[Maldives]].
* The civilization of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] located in Southern Africa, Middle Africa (excluding Chad), East Africa (excluding [[Ethiopia]], the [[Comoros]], [[Mauritius]], and the [[Swahili coast]] of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]), [[Cape Verde]], [[Ghana]], the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Considered as a possible 8th civilization by Huntington.
* Instead of belonging to one of the "major" civilizations, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Haiti]] are labeled as "Lone" countries. [[Israel]] could be considered a unique state with its own civilization, Huntington writes, but one which is extremely similar to the West. Huntington also believes that the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean]], former British colonies in the Caribbean, constitutes a distinct entity.
* There are also others which are considered "cleft countries" because they contain very large groups of people identifying with separate civilizations. Examples include [[Ukraine]] ("cleft" between its [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Eastern Rite Catholic]]-dominated western section and its [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Orthodox]]-dominated east), [[French Guiana]] (cleft between Latin America, and the West), [[Benin]], [[Chad]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Togo]] (all cleft between Islam and Sub-Saharan Africa), [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] (cleft between Hindu and Sub-Saharan African), [[Sri Lanka]] (cleft between Hindu and Buddhist), [[China]] (cleft between Sinic and Buddhist, in the case of [[Tibet]]; and the West, in the case of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), and the [[Philippines]] (cleft between Islam, in the case of [[Mindanao]]; Sinic, in the case of [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera]]; and the West). [[Sudan]] was also included as "cleft" between Islam and Sub-Saharan Africa; this division became a formal split in July 2011 following an overwhelming vote for independence by [[South Sudan]] in a [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|January 2011 referendum]].

==Huntington's thesis of civilizational clash==
[[File:Samuel P. Huntington (2004 World Economic Forum).jpg|thumb|Huntington at the 2004 World Economic Forum]]
Huntington argues that the trends of global conflict after the end of the Cold War are increasingly appearing at these civilizational divisions. Wars such as those following the break up of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], in [[Chechnya]], and between India and Pakistan were cited as evidence of inter-civilizational conflict. He also argues that the widespread Western belief in the universality of the West's values and political systems is naïve and that continued insistence on democratization and such "universal" norms will only further antagonize other civilizations. Huntington sees the West as reluctant to accept this because it built the international system, wrote its laws, and gave it substance in the form of the [[United Nations]].

Huntington identifies a major shift of economic, military, and political power from the West to the other civilizations of the world, most significantly to what he identifies as the two "challenger civilizations", Sinic and Islam.

In Huntington's view, East Asian Sinic civilization is culturally asserting itself and its values relative to the West due to its rapid economic growth. Specifically, he believes that China's goals are to reassert itself as the regional [[hegemon]], and that other countries in the region will 'bandwagon' with China due to the history of hierarchical command structures implicit in the [[Confucian]] Sinic civilization, as opposed to the individualism and pluralism valued in the West. Regional powers such as the two Koreas and Vietnam will acquiesce to Chinese demands and become more supportive of China rather than attempting to oppose it. Huntington therefore believes that the rise of China poses one of the most significant problems and the most powerful long-term threat to the West, as Chinese cultural assertion clashes with the American desire for the lack of a regional hegemony in East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Huntington argues that the Islamic civilization has experienced a massive population explosion which is fueling instability both on the [[Divisions of the world in Islam|borders of Islam]] and in its interior, where [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] movements are becoming increasingly popular. Manifestations of what he terms the "[[Islamic revival|Islamic Resurgence]]" include the [[1979 Iranian revolution]] and the first [[Gulf War]]. Perhaps the most controversial statement Huntington made in the ''Foreign Affairs'' article was that "Islam has bloody borders". Huntington believes this to be a real consequence of several factors, including the previously mentioned Muslim [[youth bulge]] and population growth and Islamic proximity to many civilizations including Sinic, Orthodox, Western, and African.

Huntington sees Islamic civilization as a potential ally to China, both having more revisionist goals and sharing common conflicts with other civilizations, especially the West. Specifically, he identifies common Chinese and Islamic interests in the areas of weapons proliferation, human rights, and democracy that conflict with those of the West, and feels that these are areas in which the two civilizations will cooperate.

Russia, Japan, and India are what Huntington terms 'swing civilizations' and may favor either side. Russia, for example, clashes with the many Muslim ethnic groups on its southern border (such as [[Chechnya]]) but—according to Huntington—cooperates with Iran to avoid further Muslim-Orthodox violence in Southern Russia, and to help continue the flow of oil. Huntington argues that a "[[Sino-Islamic connection]]" is emerging in which China will cooperate more closely with [[Iran]], Pakistan, and other states to augment its international position.

Huntington also argues that civilizational conflicts are "particularly prevalent between Muslims and non-Muslims", identifying the "bloody borders" between Islamic and non-Islamic civilizations. This conflict dates back as far as the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|initial thrust of Islam into Europe]], its eventual expulsion in the [[Reconquista|Iberian reconquest]], the attacks of the Ottoman Turks on Eastern Europe and Vienna, and the European imperial division of the Islamic nations in the 1800s and 1900s.

Huntington also believes that some of the factors contributing to this conflict are that both Christianity (upon which Western civilization is based) and Islam are:
* Missionary religions, seeking conversion of others
* Universal, "all-or-nothing" religions, in the sense that it is believed by both sides that only their faith is the correct one
* [[Teleological]] religions, that is, that their values and beliefs represent the goals of existence and purpose in human existence.

More recent factors contributing to a Western–Islamic clash, Huntington wrote, are the [[Islamic revival|Islamic Resurgence]] and demographic explosion in Islam, coupled with the values of Western universalism—that is, the view that all civilizations should adopt Western values—that infuriate Islamic fundamentalists. All these historical and modern factors combined, Huntington wrote briefly in his ''Foreign Affairs'' article and in much more detail in his 1996 book, would lead to a bloody clash between the Islamic and Western civilizations.

===Why civilizations will clash===
Huntington offers six explanations for why civilizations will clash:
# Differences among civilizations are too basic in that civilizations are differentiated from each other by history, language, culture, tradition, and, most importantly, religion. These fundamental differences are the product of centuries and the foundations of different civilizations, meaning they will not be gone soon.
# The world is becoming a smaller place. As a result, interactions across the world are increasing, which intensify "civilization consciousness" and the awareness of differences between civilizations and commonalities within civilizations.
# Due to economic modernization and social change, people are separated from longstanding local identities. Instead, religion has replaced this gap, which provides a basis for identity and commitment that transcends national boundaries and unites civilizations.
# The growth of civilization-consciousness is enhanced by the dual role of the West. On the one hand, the West is at a peak of power. At the same time, a return-to-the-roots phenomenon is occurring among non-Western civilizations. A West at the peak of its power confronts non-Western countries that increasingly have the desire, the will and the resources to shape the world in non-Western ways.
# Cultural characteristics and differences are less mutable and hence less easily compromised and resolved than political and economic ones.
# Economic regionalism is increasing. Successful economic regionalism will reinforce civilization-consciousness. Economic regionalism may succeed only when it is rooted in a common civilization.

===The West versus the Rest===
Huntington suggests that in the future the central axis of world politics tends to be the conflict between Western and non-Western civilizations, in [Stuart Hall]'s phrase, the conflict between "the West and the Rest". He offers three forms of general actions that non-Western civilization can take in response to Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hungtington SP, The Clash of Civilizations? In: Lechner FJ, Boli J, editors. The globalization reader. 4th ed. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell; 2012. 37–44&lt;/ref&gt;
# Non-Western countries can attempt to achieve isolation in order to preserve their own values and protect themselves from Western invasion. However, Huntington argues that the costs of this action are high and only a few states can pursue it.
# According to the theory of "[[Bandwagoning|band-wagoning]]" non-Western countries can join and accept Western values.
# Non-Western countries can make an effort to balance Western power through modernization. They can develop economic, military power and cooperate with other non-Western countries against the West while still preserving their own values and institutions. Huntington believes that the increasing power of non-Western civilizations in international society will make the West begin to develop a better understanding of the cultural fundamentals underlying other civilizations. Therefore, Western civilization will cease to be regarded as "universal" but different civilizations will learn to coexist and join to shape the future world.

===Core state and fault line conflicts===
&lt;!-- Possible link target. Please check before changing sub-section header. --&gt;
In Huntington's view, intercivilizational conflict manifests itself in two forms: fault line conflicts and core state conflicts.

''[[Fault line war|Fault line conflicts]]'' are on a local level and occur between adjacent states belonging to different civilizations or within states that are home to populations from different civilizations.

''Core state conflicts'' are on a global level between the major states of different civilizations. Core state conflicts can arise out of fault line conflicts when core states become involved.&lt;ref name="Huntington1"&gt;{{cite book

These conflicts may result from a number of causes, such as: relative influence or power (military or economic), discrimination against people from a different civilization, intervention to protect kinsmen in a different civilization, or different values and culture, particularly when one civilization attempts to impose its values on people of a different civilization.&lt;ref name="Huntington1"/&gt;

==Modernization, Westernization, and "torn countries"==
{{weasel|date=October 2012}}
Critics of Huntington's ideas often extend their criticisms to [[tradition]]al [[culture]]s and internal reformers who wish to modernize without adopting the values and attitudes of [[Westernization|Western]] culture. These critics{{Who|date=November 2009}} sometimes claim that to modernize it is necessary to become Westernized to a very large extent, so that sources of tension with the West will be reduced.

Japan, China and the [[Four Asian Tigers]] have modernized in many respects while maintaining traditional or authoritarian societies which distinguish them from the West. Some of these countries have clashed with the West and some have not.

Perhaps the ultimate example of non-Western modernization is Russia, the core state of the Orthodox civilization. Huntington argues that Russia is primarily a non-Western state although he seems to agree that it shares a considerable amount of cultural ancestry with the modern West. According to Huntington, the West is distinguished from Orthodox Christian countries by its experience of the [[Renaissance]], [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; by overseas [[colonialism]] rather than contiguous expansion and colonialism; and by the infusion of [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] culture through [[ancient Greece]] rather than through the continuous trajectory of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Huntington refers to countries that are seeking to affiliate with another civilization as "torn countries". [[Turkey]], whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the country since the 1920s, is his chief example. Turkey's history, culture, and traditions are derived from Islamic civilization, but Turkey's elite, beginning with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] who took power as first President in 1923, imposed Western institutions and dress, embraced the [[Latin alphabet]], joined [[NATO]], and has sought to [[European Union–Turkey relations|join the European Union]].

Mexico and Russia are also considered to be torn by Huntington. He also gives the example of Australia as a country torn between its Western civilizational heritage and its growing economic engagement with Asia.

According to Huntington, a torn country must meet three requirements to redefine its civilizational identity. Its political and economic elite must support the move. Second, the public must be willing to accept the redefinition. Third, the elites of the civilization that the torn country is trying to join must accept the country.

The book claims that to date no torn country has successfully redefined its civilizational identity, this mostly due to the elites of the 'host' civilization refusing to accept the torn country, though if Turkey gained membership in the [[European Union]], it has been noted that many of its people would support Westernization, as in the following quote by EU Minister Egemen Bağış: "This is what Europe needs to do: they need to say that when Turkey fulfills all requirements, Turkey will become a member of the EU on date X. Then, we will regain the Turkish public opinion support in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-fransanin-tutumunda-degisimin-basladigini-goruyoruz-027174 Bağış: Fransa'nın tutumunda değişimin başladığını görüyoruz | AB ve Türkiye | EurActiv.com.tr – Türkiye’nin online AB Gazetesi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109202339/http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-fransanin-tutumunda-degisimin-basladigini-goruyoruz-027174 |date=January 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to happen, it would, according to Huntington, be the first to redefine its civilizational identity.

==Criticism==
Huntington has fallen under the stern critique of various left-leaning academic writers, who have either empirically, historically, logically, or ideologically challenged his claims (Fox, 2005; Mungiu Pippidi &amp; Mindruta, 2002; Henderson &amp; Tucker, 2001; Russett, Oneal, &amp; Cox, 2000; Harvey, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J.

&lt;!-- Other books, written for the general public, similarly challenge Huntington's contentious claims. For example, in his work ''Identity and Violence: The illusion of destiny'', The Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] advances several critiques of Huntington's main concept of an inevitable clash along civilizational lines. He argues that violence occurs when individuals see each other as having a singular affiliation (e.g., Hindu, Muslim, Christian), as opposed to multiple affiliations: e.g., Hindu, woman, housewife, mother, artist, daughter, member of a particular socio-economic class etc. In this sense, and to the detriment of civilization distinctiveness, it is argued that all of these dimensions can, and should be a source of a personal identity.&lt;ref&gt; Sen, Amartya (2006). Identity and  Violence. New York: W.W. Norton. &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
In an article explicitly referring to Huntington, scholar &lt;!--the same --&gt;[[Amartya Sen]] (1999) argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;diversity is a feature of most cultures in the world. Western civilization is no exception. The practice of democracy that has won out in the modern West is largely a result of a consensus that has emerged since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], and particularly in the last century or so. To read in this a historical commitment of the West—over the millennia—to democracy, and then to contrast it with non-Western traditions (treating each as monolithic) would be a great mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sen A |year=1999 |title=Democracy as a Universal Value |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=3–17 |doi=10.1353/jod.1999.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his 2003 book ''Terror and Liberalism'', [[Paul Berman]] argues that distinct cultural boundaries do not exist in the present day. He argues there is no "Islamic civilization" nor a "Western civilization", and that the evidence for a civilization clash is not convincing, especially when considering relationships such as that between the United States and [[Saudi Arabia]]. In addition, he cites the fact that many Islamic extremists spent a significant amount of time living or studying in the Western world. According to Berman, conflict arises because of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs various groups share (or do not share), regardless of cultural or religious identity.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Paul (2003). Terror and Liberalism. W W Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-05775-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Garton Ash]] objects to the ‘extreme cultural determinism… crude to the point of parody’ of Huntington’s idea that Catholic and Protestant Europe is headed for democracy but that Orthodox Christian and Islamic Europe must accept dictatorship. &lt;ref&gt; [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[History of the Present]], Penguin, 2000, p 388-389 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]] issued a response to Huntington's thesis in his 2001 article, "[[The Clash of Ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said: [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011022/said The Clash of Ignorance] The Nation, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Said argues that Huntington's categorization of the world's fixed "civilizations" omits the dynamic interdependency and interaction of culture. A longtime critic of the Huntingtonian paradigm, and an outspoken proponent of Arab issues, Edward Said (2004) also argues that the clash of civilizations thesis is an example of "the purest invidious racism, a sort of parody of Hitlerian science directed today against Arabs and Muslims" (p.&amp;nbsp;293).&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. W. (2004). From Oslo to Iraq and the Road Map. New York: Pantheon, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized the concept of the clash of civilizations as just being a new justification for the United States "for any atrocities that they wanted to carry out", which was required after the [[Cold War]] as the [[Soviet Union]] was no longer a viable threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TrystanCJ|title=Noam Chomsky on The "Clash of Civilizations"|date=2007-03-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT64TNho59I&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermediate Region===
Huntington's geopolitical model, especially the structures for North Africa and Eurasia, is largely derived from the "[[Intermediate Region]]" geopolitical model first formulated by [[Dimitri Kitsikis]] and published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, ''A Comparative History of Greece and Turkey in the 20th century''. In Greek, ''Συγκριτική Ἱστορία Ἑλλάδος καί Τουρκίας στόν 20ό αἰῶνα'', Athens, Hestia, 1978. Supplemented 2nd edition: Hestia, 1990. 3rd edition: Hestia, 1998, 357 pp.. In Turkish, ''Yırmı Asırda Karşılaştırmalı Türk-Yunan Tarihi'', İstanbul, Türk Dünyası Araştırmaları Dergisi, II-8, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The Intermediate Region, which spans the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Indus River]], is neither Western nor Eastern (at least, with respect to the Far East) but is considered distinct.Concerning this region, Huntington departs from Kitsikis contending that a civilizational fault line exists between the two dominant yet differing religions ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Sunni Islam]]), hence a dynamic of external conflict. However, Kitsikis establishes an integrated civilization comprising these two peoples along with those belonging to the less dominant religions of [[Shia Islam]], [[Alevism]], and [[Judaism]]. They have a set of mutual cultural, social, economic and political views and norms which radically differ from those in the West and the Far East.In the Intermediate Region, therefore, one cannot speak of a civilizational clash or external conflict, but rather an internal conflict, not for cultural domination, but for political succession. This has been successfully demonstrated by documenting the rise of Christianity from the Hellenized [[Roman Empire]], the rise of the [[Caliphate|Islamic caliphates]] from the [[Byzantine Empire|Christianized Roman Empire]] and the rise of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule from the Islamic caliphates and the Christianized Roman Empire.

===Opposing concepts===
In recent years, the theory of [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]], a response to Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, has become the center of some international attention. The concept was originally coined by Austrian philosopher [[Hans Köchler]] in an essay on cultural identity (1972).&lt;ref&gt;"Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog" (Cultural Identity and Co-existence: Preconditions for a Fundamental Dialogue). Public lecture delivered at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, 19 October 1972, published in: ''Philosophie und Politik. Dokumentation eines interdisziplinären Seminars''. (Publications of the Working Group for Science and Politics at the University of Innsbruck, Vol. IV.) Innsbruck: Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik, 1973, pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[UNESCO]], Köchler had earlier proposed that the cultural organization of the United Nations should take up the issue of a "dialogue between different civilizations" (''dialogue entre les différentes civilisations'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/Koechler-letter-UNESCO-26Sep1972.jpg Letter dated 26 September 1972], addressed to the Division of Philosophy of UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Iranian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] introduced the concept at the global level. At his initiative, the United Nations proclaimed the year 2001 as the "United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216000000/http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm |date=February 16, 2003 }} ''Unesco.org'' Retrieved on 05-24-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialoguecentre.org/about.html http://www.dialoguecentre.org/about.html] ''Dialoguecentre.org'' Retrieved on 05-24-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.unu.edu/dialogue/ Dialogue Among Civilizations] United Nations University Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alliance of Civilizations]] (AOC) initiative was proposed at the 59th [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 2005 by the Spanish Prime Minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. The initiative is intended to galvanize collective action across diverse societies to combat [[extremism]], to overcome cultural and social barriers between mainly the Western and predominantly Muslim worlds, and to reduce the tensions and polarization between societies which differ in religious and cultural values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17215">[[Civic technology]] is defined as technology that enables engagement, participation or enhances the relationship between the people and government by enhancing citizen communications and public decision, improving government delivery of service, and infrastructure. Civic technology platforms specifically designed to improve citizen participation in governance. We distinguished civic tech from government technology. Government technology being technology that directly deals with government infrastructure.

== Platform types ==

We used the categorization on democratic innovations according to Dr. Graham Smith of the [[University of Southampton]], in his book "Beyond the Ballot":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/11541/|title=Beyond the ballot: 57 democratic innovations from around the world|last=Smith|first=Graham|date=2005|website=westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk|publisher=POWER Inquiry|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Electoral innovations - "aim to increase electoral turnout"
* Consultation innovations - "aim to inform decision-makers of citizens’ views" 
* Deliberative innovations - "aim to bring citizens together to deliberate on policy issues, the outcomes of which may influence decision-makers"
* Co-governance innovations - "aim to give citizens significant influence during the process of decision-making" 
* Direct democracy innovations - "aim to give citizens final decision-making power on key issues" 
* E-democracy innovations - "use information technology to engage citizens in the decision-making process"

}}'''Ctrl.Alt.Shift''' was an initiative politicising a new generation of activists for social justice and global change. It was a project of UK aid and development charity Christian Aid.

==Magazine and Website==
Ctrl.Alt.Shift was founded by [[Katrin Owusu]] and published the first issue of its magazine in June 2008. The magazines continued until 2010 and the website until mid-2011. It has published issues focusing on 'HIV &amp; Stigma' and 'Gender &amp; Power'. The magazine was edited by blogger and columnist Chantelle Fiddy who also helped edit the website. The website featured regular columnists and staff writers such as Dwain Lucktung, Eva Baker, Russell Myrie and Bibi van der Zee alongside user-generated content.

==Direct Action==
In November 2008, Ctrl.Alt.Shift launched the 'Nothing to Declare' project – a series of demonstrations with the intention of exposing the stigma created by HIV travel bans. The project was co-organised by activist pressure group [[Plane Stupid]], with grime star [[Tinchy Stryder]] lending his support outside the Russian embassy.  The protests targeted the London embassies of [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and were covered by [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/14/hiv.ban/index.html HIV-positive travelers challenge countries with 'no entry' policy - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 2009, International Women's Day, Ctrl.Alt.Shift marched through Guildhall in London to raise awareness of the 50 million women missing in India due to female foeticide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middxpremier.com/news/2009/ctrlaltshift.htm India's 50 Million Missing Women - Red Hot Curry.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090831090925/http://www.middxpremier.com/news/2009/ctrlaltshift.htm |date=2009-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural interventions de Jean Dujardin==

Ctrl.Alt.Shift garnered widespread media attention for its involvement in a number of arts-based cultural interventions, each of which has focused on a different area of social injustice in developing countries.

===Sadler's Wells 'HIV/Aids and Stigma' Dance Event===
In November 2008, it held a showcase of dance, film and music based on the stigma surrounding HIV/Aids at [[Sadler's Wells]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/22/ctrl-alt-shift-peacock-london Dance preview: Ctrl.Alt.Shift, London - The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; London. [[Nitin Sawhney]] and [[Carlos Acosta]] were mentors and there was a performance by [[JME (rapper)|JME]] of [[Boy Better Know]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2008/nov/21/youngpeople-internationalaidanddevelopment JME: I'm giving my support to a performance by Ctrl.Alt.Shift - The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

===VICE 'Gender, Poverty and Power' Photo Competition===
In early 2009 a photo competition run in conjunction with [[Vice (magazine)|VICE]] magazine focused on Gender, Poverty and Power. [[Nan Goldin]] acted as an ambassador and [[Alexa Chung]], Alex Sturrock, Ben Rayner, and [[Andy Capper]] were mentors. The winners were exhibited in February at the [[Association of Photographers]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hub.the-aop.org/News_archive/p2_articleid/102 Exhibition: Ctrl.Alt.Shift/VICE - AOP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430222142/http://hub.the-aop.org/News_archive/p2_articleid/102 |date=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BALTIC 'Conflict: War &amp; Peace' Art Exhibition===
In March 2009, Ctrl.Alt.Shift launched an art exhibition at [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|BALTIC]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balticmill.com/ctrlaltshift/ Ctrl.Alt.Shift. - BALTIC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707210642/http://www.balticmill.com/ctrlaltshift/ |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on war and conflict in Colombia and Latin America as a whole. The exhibition took place over two floors of the building and featured work produced by 12 students and recent graduates from Newcastle University's LifeWorkArt programme. It also featured specially commissioned works from south London photo-artist [[Matthew Stone]] and installation artist Graham Hudson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journallive.co.uk/culture-newcastle/arts-news/2008/12/17/new-exhibition-from-graham-hudson-and-matthew-stone-61634-22496673/ New exhibition from Graham Hudson and Matthew Stone - The Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; who acted as project mentors. Urban sculptor and photographer T-Magic, street artist Benjamin Wachenje and BALTIC freelance artists, Alison Unsworth and Paul Merrick also featured, and [[David Shrigley]] was Creative Ambassador.

{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=Concepts}}
"'''Dual Power'''" ({{lang-rus|Двоевластие|r=Dvoyevlastiye}}) was a term first used by [[Communism|communist]] [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described a situation in the wake of the [[February Revolution]], the first of two [[Russian Revolution]]s in that tumultuous year of [[1917]]. Two powers coexisted with each other and competed for legitimacy: the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] ([[workers councils]]), particularly the [[Petrograd Soviet]], and the continuing official state apparatus of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] of democratic socialists.

Lenin argued that this essentially unstable situation constituted a unique opportunity for the Soviets and Bolsheviks to seize power by smashing the weak tottering Provisional Government and establishing themselves as the basis of a new form of state power.

This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent [[communist]]-led revolutions elsewhere in the world, including the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1949 led by [[Mao Zedong]] (1893-1976) after the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1931 and 1946-1949) and in [[eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]] (1939-1945), such as in [[Czechoslovakia]] where after three years of post-war agitation and occupation by the invading Russian [[Red Army]] finally overthrew a moderate government with the Communists seizing power in 1948.

== Background ==
After [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicated the throne, the resulting [[February Revolution]] led to the establishment of the Provisional Government and its counterpart, the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. The Provisional Government was composed of former State Duma representatives with approval from the Petrograd Soviet, whereas the Petrograd Soviet was made up of socialist leaders elected by a [[proletariat]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russian government moving from an [[autocracy]] to this system of "dual power" with the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet constantly vying for power, there was much confusion on how both could coexist and govern effectively.

In this confusion, the Provisional Government realized the Soviet had the people's trust and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the hopes of appeasing the Soviet and keeping the support of the population, the Provisional Government launched several very bold liberal acts and promoted civil liberties through means of freedom of speech, press, and assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other than strategic political motives, the Provisional Government understood that their power was illegitimate, due to the fact that they were not elected by the people. To solve the problem of illegitimacy, the Provisional Government was in the process of establishing the Constituent Assembly, whose members would be democratically elected by the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Constituent Assembly would never come to be under the Provisional Government's rule, as the elections were set after the Bolsheviks seized power in the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 348&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February Revolution, Lenin published his April Theses and in it he expressed unhappiness with the February Revolution as he described it as a "Bourgeois Revolution".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Russian Revolution, 1861-1917|last=Wood|first=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed for the slogan "All Power to the Soviets". Lenin mentioned that a Proletariat Revolution is necessary, and expressed that he has no interest in cooperating with the Provisional Government or the other Soviet leaders who are willing to compromise. Other Soviet leadership were skeptical to Lenin's ideas since they were afraid that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were advocating for anarchism. Lenin also criticized the Petrograd Soviet for governing alongside the Provisional Government, and accused them of forgetting and abandoning socialist ideas and the proletariat revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Provisional Government ==
The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]'s members primarily consisted of former [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] members under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s reign. Its members were mainly members of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (known as the Kadets party), as the Kadets were the only formal political party functioning in the Provisional Government at its conception. The ideological and political ideas differed wildly throughout the party's leadership and members, but most were moderates, offering both liberal and conservative views at times.  The Kadets and the Provisional Government alike pushed for new policies including the release of political prisoners, a decree of freedom of press, cessation of the [[Okhrana]], abolition of the death penalty, and rights for minorities. The Provisional Government and the Kadets also wanted Russia to continue to be involved in [[World War I]], much to the dismay of the Soviets. Despite certain political ideas, the Kadets became slightly more conservative overall with the rise of left-wing parties and left-wing thought within both the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government realized that their power was not legitimate since they were former Duma members, and not elected by a general public. They knew that to be seen as a legitimate government body, they would need to be elected by the people, and they established the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and scheduled popular elections to take place later in the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky]], a former member of the Fourth Duma and a chairmen of the Soviet Executive Committee and eventually the Prime Minister for the Provisional Government, was brought into the Provisional Government as a way to gain support from left-wing parties and the Petrograd Soviet. Kerensky was a moderate socialist, and believed that cooperation with the Provisional Government was necessary. Historian S.A. Smith explains that after the appointment of Kerensky "Thus was born 'dual power', an institutional arrangement under which the Provisional Government enjoyed formal authority, but where the Soviet Executive Committee had real power."&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government feared the Soviets immense growing power, and through this fear they tried to appease them as much as possible. When Kerensky became Prime Minister, he attempted to work with the Soviets including arming the Soviets and their followers during the [[Kornilov affair]]. The attempts of Kerensky would not last for a while, as the [[Bolsheviks]] did not believe in compromise and overthrew the Provisional Government in the October Revolution.

== Petrograd Soviet ==
The Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in Petrograd served as the voice of the smaller councils of deputies elected by commoners, specifically soldiers and workers. The Petrograd Soviet, therefore, could claim a much better understanding of the people's will, since it was composed of many orators whom the lower class population elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50418695|title=Voices of revolution : 1917|last=1953-|first=Steinberg, Mark D.,|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300101690|location=New Haven, CT|oclc=50418695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet was established after the February Revolution, composed of numerous socialist revolutionaries. However, its rapid rise to power meant the Petrograd Soviet did not have any legitimate claim to power, like its counterpart, the Provisional Government.

The workers and soldiers of Russia saw hope in the Petrograd soviets, and elected deputies to it en masse, causing it to gain membership at an alarming rate (1200 seats had been filled in a week). The Petrograd Soviet was seen as a benefactor that would bring them land, bread, and peace.

The Executive Committee was initially made up of Nikolai Ckheidze, Matvei Skobelev, and Alexander Kerensky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954018220|title=Russia in revolution : an empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928|last=1952-|first=Smith, S. A. (Stephen Anthony),|isbn=9780198734826|edition=First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=954018220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were socialists, but feared radicalism. To keep radical mentality from spreading and provoking a 'counter-revolutionary movement,' they chose to support the Provisional Government where necessary. This led to the uneasy balance of power called "Dual Power."

==July Days impact ==
The events of the [[July Days]] would solidify the issues of dual power within government between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet. Between the dates of July 3 and July 7 ([[Julian calendar|Julian Calendar]] date), a Bolshevik uprising, still disputed if intentional by Lenin, occurred. In what is seen as a "[[Grassroots|grass roots]]" uprising, workers and lower ranks of soldiers violently demonstrated in the streets, calling for the Soviet to take power over the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),124&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was supported by the Bolshevik Military Organization and Petersburg Committee, who sent in more support, but the leaders of the party had less concrete opinions about the demonstration.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"&gt;Lewis Siegelbaum, "July Days" [subject essay], ''Seventeen Moments in Soviet History: An On-Line Archive of Primary Sources'', accessed November 5, 2017, http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1917-2/july-days/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky|Alexander Kerenksy]], head of the Provisional Government, led a crackdown on those involved with the events of the July Days and overthrow of the Provisional Government. The military was used to gather and arrest violent demonstrators, retake government buildings from Bolshevik forces, and dissolve military units that had participated in the attempted overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 156&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government also attempted to undermine Lenin and his party by revealing their investigation of his ties to Germany, Russia's enemy during World War I.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"/&gt; These combined actions would quell the Bolshevik uprising and support until August 1917 (Julian).

The reinstatement of the death penalty for soldiers, and Kerensky transferring the Provisional Government into the Winter Palace were among the actions that led to accusations of counterrevolutionary activity (reestablishment of autocratic government) by the Provisional Government.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Ferro, Marc (1971). "The Russian Soldier in 1917: Undisciplined, Patriotic, and Revolutionary". ''Slavic Review''. 30 (3): 483-512&lt;/ref&gt; A new kind of duality between the classes (proletariat and bourgeoisie) was a split noticeable not only in government, but also in everyday life for Russians. This led to increased tensions between both theaters, and made it difficult for groups to collaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Kaiser, ''The Workers' Revolution in Russia, 1917: The View From Below'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Petrograd Soviet represented the Proletariat, while the Provisional Government members were part of the former State Duma, representing the old government under the tsar. This divide was also evident in the military, between rank-and-file soldiers and military officers.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; As World War I continued on, soldiers started to mutiny or to disobey orders from their superiors, while supporting the soviets, hoping to bring an end to Russia's involvement in the war.

== Bolshevik takeover ==
Although the Bolshevik party was largely put down after the events of the July Days, Lenin still believed that the group could gain power in government because of unsteadiness due to the dual power situation. In April he wrote that the time was not yet right for revolution, as the Petrograd Soviet was still involved and working with the Provisional Government, as well as stating, "we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets."&lt;ref&gt;V.I Lenin,"The Dual Power", ''Marxist Internet Archive'', 2005, accessed October 30, 2017, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With the July Days seen as "Lenin's worst blunder,"&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),122&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was not necessarily his intention, the Bolsheviks were still not in place to take over the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet.

However, with the [[Kornilov affair]] of August 1917 (Julian-style date), the Bolsheviks regained both power in their party, but also with the masses. With Kornilov's soldiers moving towards the capital of Petrograd (modern day [[Saint Petersburg]]) and the Provisional Government, Kerensky had released many Bolshevik leaders arrested during the July Days and also provided arms in order for the Bolsheviks to defend the Provisional Government. By arming and calling on those who he had earlier punished, the Bolsheviks saw that they truly were gaining power in the government and Russian society. The Russian population lost faith in the Provisional Government because of how it handled Kornilov's coup, and many began supporting the Bolsheviks, with the group winning elections throughout Petrograd, especially in districts made up of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 171&lt;/ref&gt; This event, coupled with food shortages, the continuation of Russian involvement in World War I, and mass unemployment, worked in the Bolsheviks favor, turning people away from the government in charge&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),147&lt;/ref&gt; and toward the party that promised "Bread, Peace, Land."&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government during the [[October Revolution]], they were able to do so with little resistance. The Provisional Government realized that their power was limited at the point of takeover, as the Bolsheviks had been gaining supporters and had more revolutionaries. When the actual overthrow occurred between the days of October 25 and 26 (Julian), Bolsheviks first seized means of transportation and communication, such as roads, bridges, railways, and post offices.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin then went to the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies to present the overthrow of the Provisional Government and state authority by the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 173&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Winter Palace]] (at the time, the home of the Provisional Government) was seized without a causality the morning of the 26th, and the Congress had no choice but to approve Lenin's decree.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 175&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the period of dual power between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet came to a close.

== Strategy and ideological concepts ==
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
As the [[ideology|ideological]] monopoly of dominant [[institutions]] is broken and people increasingly rely on Alternative Institutions (AIs), those who benefited from existing arrangements may seek to dismantle their upstart competitors. At the same time, those who seek fundamental changes in society or who find the alternative ways of organizing it valuable may seek to enlarge and strengthen the alternative infrastructure. Counter institutions (XIs) are created both to defend the AIs and to promote their growth. These work to challenge and attack the [[status quo]] while creating, defending, and securing space for opposition and alternative institutions. They do this with everything from [[political protest]]s, to direct appropriation (of plantations, government buildings, factories, etc.) for the use of alternative institutions, to civil disobedience or armed resistance. The line between AIs and XIs is seldom entirely clear as many alternative institutions are also self-promoting or defending. Together the AIs and XIs form an alternative source of power in society which is "necessarily autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system, seeking to encroach upon the latter's domain, and, eventually, to replace it."&lt;ref name="Dominick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://left-liberty.net/?p=265|title=An Introduction to Dual Power Strategy|last=Dominick|first=Brian A.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of building the alternative institutions and the ideology that supports them, the advantage of dual power is the creation of real, and not merely political, momentum towards the revolutionary transformation of society. Actual changes are ongoing, rather than postponed to a revolutionary moment, so needs unmet by the pre-existing order are being met during the struggle and no sector of society is told that its concerns can only be dealt with after victory is achieved. That is, creation of AIs and the political space for them has intrinsic benefits, apart from the advancement of the revolutionary project. Over the course of building AIs, the society at large is empowered, committed to change, and skilled in running society. Simultaneously, the credibility of a revolutionary vision is increased immensely by putting it into practice and by refining and improving it over time. It is also conceivable that factional splits between revolutionaries and reformers (and all the shades in between) could be reduced by having a common project that both find useful. Those forces that would be sent to suppress a revolutionary movement find themselves confronting people who have taken control over their own lives, rather than armed cadre attempting to impose a vision on the country, potentially obviating military conflict or at least reducing its severity. {{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

Successful dual-power rebellions end with the acceptance of the new social forms by much of the populace and the realization by the old rulers that they are no longer capable of using their systems of force against the revolutionary movement. This can occur because noncooperation has crippled the old structures of power, because too few people remain loyal to the old rulers to enforce their will, or because the rulers themselves undergo an ideological conversion. At this point, there is not general confusion. The disappearance of old leaders and structures of power is accommodated by the expansion of the alternative system. The alleged "necessity" for a revolutionary vanguard to guide the revolutionary impulse is shown to have no basis: because the people have already learned how to govern their own affairs, they need no tutelage from above. The possibility of co-option is minimized: "When the people recognize their true power, it cannot be taken away by rhetoric or […] imposition."&lt;ref name='Dominick'/&gt;

Dual power is a strategy, rather than an ideology, and it could plausibly be used to advance a variety of forms of social change. However, the advantages of the strategy make it most compatible with perspectives that emphasize the exercise of power at the community level, that seek to make the revolutionary movement accountable to the people, that see the capability to revision and transform society as common rather than rare, and that seek decentralized forms of power. Call this version of the strategy grassroots dual power, the bottom-up transformation and replacement of the mechanisms of society.{{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

[[Libertarian socialists]] have more recently appropriated the term to refer to the nonviolent strategy of achieving a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct [[participatory democracy]] to contest the existing power structures of state and capitalism. This does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual-power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions."&lt;ref name='Yates'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingnonviolence.org/feature/art-after-occupy/|first=Yates|last=McKee|title=Art after Occupy — climate justice, BDS and beyond|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "counterpower" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

{{Governance}}

'''Environmental, social and governance''' ('''ESG''') refers to the three central factors in measuring the [[sustainability]] and ethical impact of an [[investment]] in a company or [[business]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Kell]] ([[United Nations Global Compact]]), [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/five-trends-corporate-social-responsbility-global-movement "Five trends that show corporate responsibility is here to stay"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 August 2014 (page visited on 28 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

These criteria help to better determine the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).&lt;ref name=Eccles&gt;Robert Eccles, Ioannis Ioannou and George Serafeim, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-key-corporate-success "Is sustainability now the key to corporate success? Companies that adopted environmental, social and governance policies in the 1990s have outperformed those that didn't"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 January 2012 (page visited on 28 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historical decisions of where financial assets would be placed were based on various criteria, financial return being predominant.&lt;ref&gt;1. Coleman, James S, ''Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital'' , (American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 94, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have always been plenty of other criteria for deciding where to place your money – from Political considerations to Heavenly Reward. It was in the 1950s and 60s that the vast [[pension funds]] managed by the Trades Unions recognised the opportunity to affect the wider social environment using their capital assets&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B.C., ''Trade Union Government and Administration in Great Britain'' (Harvard University Press, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; - in the [[United States]] the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers invested their considerable [[capital (economics)|capital]] in developing [[affordable housing]] projects, whilst the [[United Mine Workers]] invested in health facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Hillel, ''New Directions in the Investment and Control of Pension Funds'', (Investor Responsibility Research Center, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the worldwide abhorrence of the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]] led to one of the most renowned examples of selective [[disinvestment]] along ethical lines. As a response to a growing call for [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against the regime, the [[Reverend Leon Sullivan]], a board member of [[General Motors]] in the United States, drew up a Code of Conduct in 1971 for practising business with South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} What became known as the [[Sullivan Principles]] attracted a great deal of attention and several reports were commissioned by the government, to examine how many US companies were investing in South African companies that were contravening the Sullivan Code. The conclusions of the reports led to a mass disinvestment by the US from many South African companies. The resulting pressure applied to the South African regime by its business community added great weight to the growing impetus for the system of apartheid to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org|title=The leon H. Sullivan Foundation|work=thesullivanfoundation.org|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619122409/http://thesullivanfoundation.org/#|archive-date=19 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Milton Friedman]], in direct response to the prevailing mood of [[philanthropy]] argued that social responsibility adversely affects a firm's financial performance and that regulation and interference from "big government" will always damage the macro economy.&lt;ref&gt;Freidman, Milton and Rose, ''Free to Choose, A Personal Statement'', (Harcourt, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; His contention that the valuation of a company or asset should be predicated almost exclusively on the pure bottom line (with the costs incurred by social responsibility being deemed non-essential), underwrote the belief prevalent for most of the 20th century. Towards the end of the century however a contrary theory began to gain ground. In 1988 James S. Coleman wrote an article in the [[American Journal of Sociology]] entitled ''Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital'', the article challenged the dominance of the concept of ‘self-interest’ in economics and introduced the concept of [[social capital]] into the measurement of value.&lt;ref&gt;9. Coleman, James S, Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a new form of pressure applied, acting in a coalition with environmental groups, it used the [[Leverage (finance)|leveraging]] power of its collective investors to encourage companies and capital markets to incorporate environmental and social challenges into their day-to-day decision-making. The [http://ceres.org/ Ceres coalition] today represents one of the world's strongest investment groups with over 60 institutional investors from the U.S. and Europe managing over $4 trillion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceres.org|title=Ceres - Mobilizing Business Leadership for a Sustainable World|work=ceres.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of selective investment was not a new one with the demand side of the investment market having a long history of those wishing to control the effects of their investments, what began to develop at the turn of the 21st century was a response from the supply-side of the equation. The investment market began to pick up on the growing need for products geared towards what was becoming known as the Responsible Investor. In 1998 [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]], co-founder of the business consultancy SustainAbility, published ''Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business'' in which he identified the newly emerging cluster of non financial considerations which should be included in the factors determining a company or equity's value. He coined the phrase the "[[triple bottom line]]", referring to the financial, environmental and social factors included in the new calculation. At the same time the strict division between the environmental sector and the financial sector began to break down. In the [[City of London]] in 2002, Chris Yates-Smith a member of the international panel chosen to oversee the technical construction, accreditation and distribution of the Organic Production Standard and founder of one if the City of London's leading Branding Consultancies, established one of the first environmental finance research groups. The informal group of financial leaders, city lawyers and environmental stewardship [[NGO]]s became known as ''The Virtuous Circle'', its brief was to examine the nature of the correlation between environmental and social standards and financial performance. Several of the world's big banks and investment houses began to respond to the growing interest in the ESG investment market with the provision of sell-side services, among the first were the Brazilian bank [[Unibanco]], and Mike Tyrell's Jupiter Fund in London which used ESG based research to provide both [[HSBC]] and [[Citicorp]] with selective investment services in 2001.

In the early years of the new millennium, the major part of the investment market still accepted the historical assumption that ethically directed investments were by their nature likely to reduce financial return. Philanthropy was not known to be a highly profitable business and Friedman had provided a widely accepted academic basis for the argument that the costs of behaving in an ethically responsible manner would outweigh the benefits. However the assumptions were beginning to be fundamentally challenged. In 1998 two journalists Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz had brought out the ''Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For'', initially a listing in the magazine ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', then a book compiling a list of the best practicing companies in the United States with regard to [[corporate social responsibility]] and how their financial performance fared as a result. Of the three areas of concern that ESG represented, the environmental and social had received most of the public and media attention, not least because of the growing fears concerning [[climate change]]. Moskowitz brought the spotlight onto the corporate governance aspect of responsible investment. His analysis concerned how the companies were managed, what the stockholder relationships were and how the employees were treated. He argued that improving corporate governance procedures did not damage financial performance, on the contrary it maximised productivity, ensured corporate efficiency and led to the sourcing and utilising of superior management talents. In the early 2000s, the success of Moskowitz's list and its impact on company's ease of recruitment and brand reputation began to challenge the historical assumptions regarding the financial effect of ESG factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Ballou, B., Godwin, Norman H., Toppe Shortridge, Rebecca, ''Firm Value and Employee Attitudes on Workplace Quality'', (Accounting Horizons, Vol. 17, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Alex Edmans, a finance professor at Wharton, published a paper in the ''Journal of Financial Economics'' showing that the 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed their peers in terms of stock returns by 2-3% a year over 1984-2009, and delivered earnings that systematically exceeded analyst expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=985735 Edmans, Alex, ''Does the Stock Market Fully Value Intangibles? Employee Satisfaction and Equity Prices'', (Journal of Financial Economics Vol. 101, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Finance Initiative commissioned a report from the international law firm [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]] on the interpretation of the law with respect to investors and ESG issues. The Freshfields report concluded that not only was it permissible for investment companies to integrate ESG issues into investment analysis but it was arguably part of their fiduciary duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unepfi.org|title=UNEP Finance Initiative: Innovative financing for sustainability|work=unepfi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/freshfields_legal_resp_20051123.pdf Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer ''A Legal Framework for the Integration of Environmental, Social and Governance Issues into Institutional Investment: A Report Produced for the Asset management Working Group of the UNEP FI'', 2005 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)]] confirmed that there was no bar on pension trustees and others from taking account of ESG factors when making investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/fiduciary_duties.htm |title=Law Commission |work=justice.gov.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041547/http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/fiduciary_duties.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Friedman had provided the academic support for the argument that the integration of ESG type factors into financial practice would reduce financial performance, numerous reports began to appear in the early years of the century which provided research that supported arguments to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan Douglas, G, ''Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connexion'', (Ceres, March 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Oxford University's Michael Barnett and New York University's Robert Salomon published an influential study which concluded that the two sides of the argument might even be complementary – they propounded a curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, both selective investment practices and non-selective could maximise financial performance of an investment portfolio, the only route likely to damage performance was a middle way of selective investment.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Michael and Salomon, Robert, ''Beyond Dichotomy: The Curvilinear Relationship between Social Responsibility and Financial Performance'', (Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 27, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the large investment companies and banks taking an interest in matters ESG, an array of investment companies specifically dealing with responsible investment and ESG based portfolios began to spring up throughout the financial world.

Many in the investment industry believe the development of ESG factors as considerations in investment analysis to be inevitable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;IPE European Institutional Asset Management Survey, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence toward a relationship between consideration for ESG issues and financial performance is becoming greater and the combination of fiduciary duty and a wide recognition of the necessity of the sustainability of investments in the long term has meant that environmental social and corporate governance concerns are now becoming increasingly important in the investment market.&lt;ref name="responsibility2006"&gt;Aguilera, Ruth et al, ''Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility; a comparative analysis of the UK and the US'' (Corporate Governance, Blackwell, Vol. 14, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eccles/&gt; ESG has become less a question of philanthropy than practicality.

There has been uncertainty and debate as to what to call the inclusion of intangible factors relating to the sustainability and ethical impact of investments. Names have ranged from the early use of buzz words such as "green" and "eco", to the wide array of possible descriptions for the types of investment analysis - "responsible investment", "socially responsible investment" (SRI), "ethical", "extra-financial", "long horizon investment" (LHI), "enhanced business", "corporate health", "non-traditional", and others. But the predominance of the term ESG has now become fairly widely accepted. A survey of 350 global investment professionals conducted by AXA Investment Managers and AQ Research in 2008 concluded the vast majority of professionals preferred the term ESG to describe such data.

Interest in ESG and sustainable investing runs strong for plan participants, according to Natixis' 2016 Survey of Defined Contribution Plan Participants2. In fact, more than six in ten participants agreed they would be more likely to contribute or increase their contributions to their retirement plan if they knew their investments were doing social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ngam.natixis.com/us/resources/2016-survey-of-defined-contribution-plan-participants/ |title=Natixis Global Asset Management ''Investor Insight Series: Running on Empty, Attitudes and Actions of Defined Contribution Plan Participants''|date=2016|format=PDF|website=Ngam.natixis.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the PRI, UNEP FI and The Generation Foundation launched a three-year project to end the debate on whether fiduciary duty is a legitimate barrier to the integration of environmental, social and governance issues in investment practice and decision-making.

This follows the publication in September 2015 of ''Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century'' by the PRI, UNEP FI, UNEP Inquiry and UN Global Compact. The report concluded that “Failing to consider all long-term investment value drivers, including ESG issues, is a failure of fiduciary duty". It also acknowledged that despite significant progress, many investors have yet to fully integrate ESG issues into their investment decision-making processes.

== Environmental concerns ==
{{main article|Environmental governance}}
Threat of climate change and the depletion of resources has grown, so investors have to factor sustainability issues into their investment choices. The issues often represent externalities, such as influences on the functioning and revenues of the company that are not exclusively affected by market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;IPE European Institutional Asset Management Survey, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As with all areas of ESG the breadth of possible concerns is vast, but some of the chief areas are listed below:

===Climate change===
The body of research providing evidence of global trends in climate change has led investors – pension funds, holders of insurance reserves – to begin to screen investments in terms of their impact on the perceived factors of climate change. Fossil fuel reliant industries are less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Supachai Panitchpakdi, UNCTAD Secretary General’s Statement, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, investment policies were particularly affected by the conclusions of the ''[[Stern Review]]'' in 2006, a report commissioned by the British government to provide an economic analysis of the issues associated with climate change. Its conclusions pointed towards the necessity of including considerations of climate change and environmental issues in all financial calculations and that the benefits of early action on climate change would outweigh its costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sternreview.org.uk|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT]        Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change - HM Treasury|work=sternreview.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
Responsible Investing often chose to deselect firms associated with the construction of nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Co-operative Group Sustainable Leaders Trust, Report, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The dual concerns of the speed of depletion of fossil fuels and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have led to a re-examination of the concerns regarding nuclear power{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} .

===Sustainability===
In every area of the debate from the depletion of resources to the future of industries dependent upon diminishing [[raw materials]] the question of the obsolescence of a company's product or service is becoming central to the value ascribed to that company. The Long Term view is becoming prevalent amongst investors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Social concerns ==

===Diversity===
The level of [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] in a company's recruitment policies is becoming a key concern to investors. There is a growing perception that the broader the pool of talent open to an employer the greater the chance of finding the optimum person for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Jayne, Michele E. A. and Dipboye, Robert L., ''Leveraging Diversity to Improve Business Performance'', (Human Resource Management, Wiley, Vol. 43, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation and agility are seen as the great benefits of diversity and there is an increasing awareness of what has come to be known as ‘the power of difference’.&lt;ref&gt;Merck, ''Promoting Diversity and Inclusion'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
In 2006 the US Courts of Appeals ruled that there was a case to answer bringing the area of a company's social responsibilities squarely into the financial arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org|title=Homepage - Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre|work=business-humanrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area of concern is widening to include such considerations as the impact on local communities, the health and welfare of employees and a more thorough examination of a company's [[supply chain]].

===Consumer protection===
Until fairly recently, [[caveat emptor]] ("buyer beware") was the governing principle of commerce and trading. In recent times however there has been an increased assumption that the consumer has a right to a degree of protection and the vast growth in damages [[litigation]] has meant that consumer protection is a central consideration for those seeking to limit a company's risk and those examining a company's credentials with an eye to investing. The collapse of the US Sub-Prime Mortgage market initiated a growing movement against [[predatory lending]] has also become an important area of concern.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Donald P., ''Defining and Predicting Predatory Lending'', (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report 273, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
From the testing of products on animals to the welfare of animals bred for the food market, concern about the welfare of animals is a large consideration for those investors seeking a thorough understanding of the company or industry being analyzed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Corporate governance concerns ==

Corporate governance covers the area of investigation into the rights and responsibilities of the management of a company – its board, shareholders and the various stakeholders in that company.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Management structure===
The system of internal procedures and controls that makes up the management structure of a company is in the valuation of that company's equity.&lt;ref name="responsibility2006"/&gt; Attention has been focused in recent years on the balance of power between the CEO and the Board of Directors and specifically the differences between the European model and the US model – in the States studies have found that 80% of companies have a CEO who is also the Chairman of the Board, in the UK and the European model it was found that 90% of the largest companies split the roles of CEO and Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, D, ''Review of the Role and Effectiveness of Non-Executive Directors'' (Higgs Report, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employee relations===
From diversity to the establishment of corporate behaviours and values, the role that improving employee relations plays in assessing the value of a company is proving increasingly central. In the United States Moskowitz's list of the ''Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For'' has become not only an important tool for employees but companies are beginning to compete keenly for a place on the list, as not only does it help to recruit the best workforce, it appears to have a noticeable impact on company values.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

===Executive compensation===
Companies are now being asked to list the percentage levels of bonus payments and the levels of remuneration of the highest paid executives are coming under close scrutiny from stock holders and equity investors alike.

== Responsible investment ==

The three concepts of social, environmental and corporate governance are intimately linked to the concept of Responsible Investment. RI began as a niche investment area, serving the needs of those who wished to invest but wanted to do so within ethically defined parameters. In recent years it has become a much larger proportion of the investment market.

===Investment strategies===
RI seeks to control the placing of its investments via several methods:
* Positive selection; where the investor actively selects the companies in which to invest; this can be done either by following a defined set of ESG criteria or by the best-in-class method where a subset of high performing ESG compliant companies is chosen for inclusion in an investment portfolio.
* Activism; strategic voting by shareholders in support of a particular issue, or to bring about change in the governance of the company.
* Engagement; investment funds monitoring the ESG performance of all portfolio companies and leading constructive shareholder engagement dialogues with each company to ensure progress.&lt;ref&gt;French research centre Novethic &lt;http://www.novethic.com&gt; issues a SRI engagement label, which was extended to [[Fondation Guilé]] e.g.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consulting role; the larger institutional investors and shareholders tend to be able to engage in what is known as ‘quiet diplomacy’, with regular meetings with top management in order to exchange information and act as early warning systems for risk and strategic or governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J., ''Influence and Intervention by Financial Institutions in their Investee Companies'', (Corporate Governance, Issue 6, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exclusion; the removal of certain sectors or companies from consideration for investment, based on ESG specific criteria.
* Integration; the inclusion of ESG risks and opportunities into traditional financial analysis of equity value.

===Institutional investors===
{{See also|Institutional investors}}
One of the defining marks of the modern investment market is the divergence in the relationship between the firm and its equity investors. Institutional investors have become the key owners of stock - rising from 35% in 1981 to 58% in 2002 in the US&lt;ref&gt;Binay, M., ''Performance Attribution of UA Institutional Investors '' (Financial Management, Summer, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and from 42% in 1963 to 84.7% in 2004 in the UK&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, ''Share Ownership'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions tend to work on a long term investment strategy. Insurance companies, Mutual Funds and Pension Funds with long-term payout obligations are much more interested in the long term sustainability of their investments than the individual investor looking for short-term gain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Where a Pension Fund is subject to ERISA, there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants' economic returns.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' §§2:125 - 2:127 (Thomson West, 2014-2015 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the belief that addressing ESG issues [https://www.malartu.co/blog/2018/5/22/overcoming-esg-challenges] will protect and enhance portfolio returns, responsible investment is rapidly becoming a mainstream concern within the institutional industry. By late 2016, over a third of institutional investors (commonly referred to as LPs) based in Europe and Asia-Pacific said that ESG considerations played a major or primary role in refusing to commit to a private equity fund, while the same is true for a fifth of North American LPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collercapital.com/coller-capital-global-pe-barometer-winter-2016-17|title=Coller Capital Global PE Barometer – Winter 2016-17 {{!}} Coller Capital|website=Collercapital.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to investor interest in ESG, private equity and other industry trade associations have developed a number of ESG best practices, including a due diligence questionnaire for private fund managers and other asset managers to use before investing in a portfolio company. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.navatargroup.com/webinar/finding-esg-mindset-invest-europe|title=Finding Your ESG Mindset with Invest Europe {{!}} Navatar|work=Navatar|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles for Responsible Investment===
The [[Principles for Responsible Investment]] Initiative (PRI) was established in 2005 by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the [[UN Global Compact]] as a framework for improving the analysis of ESG issues in the investment process and to aid companies in the exercise of responsible ownership practices. As of 2015 there were a total of 1354 PRI signatories, consisting of 288 asset owners, 882 investment managers and 184 professional service partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/|title = Principles for Responsible Investment {{ndash}} Signatories|date = 5 February 2015|accessdate = 5 February 2015|website = PRI Signatories|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921184606/http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/#|archive-date = 21 September 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equator Principles ===
{{main article|Equator Principles}}
The [http://www.equator-principles.com/ Equator Principles] is a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in project finance. It is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equator-principles.com/|title=Home|website=Equator-principles.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 6 March 2017, [http://www.equator-principles.com/index.php/members-reporting 92 adopting financial institutions] in 37 countries have officially adopted the Equator Principles, covering the majority of international Project Finance debt in emerging and developed markets.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Christopher, and Alexis Rwabizambuga. "Institutional pressures, corporate reputation, and voluntary codes of conduct: An examination of the equator principles." ''Business and Society Review'' 111.1 (2006): 89-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) commit to not provide loans to projects where the borrower will not or is unable to comply with their respective social and environmental policies and procedures.

The Equator Principles, formally launched in Washington DC on 4 June 2003, were based on existing environmental and social policy frameworks established by the [[International Finance Corporation]].  These standards have subsequently been periodically updated into what is commonly known as the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and on the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equator Principles History and Context FAQ|url=http://equator-principles.com/resources/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions.pdf|format=PDF|website=Equator-principles.com|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESG Ratings Agencies ==
Asset managers and other financial institutions increasingly rely on ESG ratings agencies to assess, measure and compare companies' ESG performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/07/27/esg-reports-and-ratings-what-they-are-why-they-matter/|title=ESG Reports and Ratings: What they are, why they matter|last=Huber|first=Betty|date=27 July 2017|website=Harvard Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disclosure and regulation ==
The first ten years of the new century has seen a vast growth in the ESG defined investment market. Not only do most of the world's big banks now have departments and divisions exclusively addressing Responsible Investment but boutique firms specialising in advising and consulting on environmental, social and governance related investments are proliferating. One of the major aspects of the ESG side of the insurance market which leads to this tendency to proliferation is the essentially subjective nature of the information on which investment selection can be made. By definition ESG data is qualitative; it is non-financial and not readily quantifiable in monetary terms. The investment market has long dealt with these intangibles – such variables as Goodwill have been widely accepted as contributing to a company's value. But the ESG intangibles are not only highly subjective they are also particularly difficult to quantify and more importantly verify.

One of the major issues in the ESG area is [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|disclosure]]. Environmental risks created by business activities have actual or potential negative impact on air, land, water, ecosystems, and human health &lt;ref&gt;esg.adec-innovations.com, [http://www.esg.adec-innovations.com/about-us/faqs/what-is-esg/ What is ESG?]&lt;/ref&gt; . The information on which an investor makes his decisions on a financial level is fairly simply gathered. The company's accounts can be examined, and although the accounting practices of corporate business are coming increasingly into disrepute after a spate of recent financial scandals, the figures are for the most part externally verifiable. With ESG considerations, the practice has been for the company under examination to provide its own figures and disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Association of British Insurers, ''Disclosure Guidelines on Socially Responsible Investment'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; These have seldom been externally verified and the lack of universal standards and [[regulation]] in the areas of environmental and social practice mean that the measurement of such statistics is subjective to say the least. As integrating ESG considerations into investment analysis and the calculation of a company's value become more prevalent it will become more crucial to provide units of measurement for investment decisions on subjective issues such as degrees of harm to workers, or how far down the supply chain of the production chain of a cluster bomb do you go.

One of the solutions put forward to the inherent subjectivity of ESG data is the provision of universally accepted standards for the measurement of ESG factors. Such organisations as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (International Organisation for Standardisation) provide highly researched and widely accepted standards for many of the areas covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|website=ISO|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some investment consultancies, such as Probus-Sigma have created methodologies for calculating the ratings for an ESG based Ratings Index that is both based on ISO standards and externally verified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Burocratik |url=http://www.probus-sigma.eu |title=Probus Sigma |website=Probus-sigma.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the formalisation of the acceptance of such standards as the basis for calculating and verifying ESG disclosures is by no means universal.

The corporate governance side of the matter has received rather more in the way of regulation and standardisation as there is a longer history of regulation in this area. In 1992 the [[London Stock Exchange]] and the Financial Reporting Commission set up the Cadbury Commission to investigate the series of governance failures that had plagued the City of London such as the bankruptcies of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], [[Polly Peck]], and [[Robert Maxwell]]'s [[Mirror Group]]. The conclusions that the commission reached were compiled in 2003 into the ''Combined Code on Corporate Governance'' which has been widely accepted (if patchily applied) by the financial world as a benchmark for good governance practices.&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury Committee on [[the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance]], ''Report with Code of Best Practice'', (London, Gee Publishing, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key areas of concern in the discussion as to the reliability of ESG disclosures is the establishment of credible ratings for companies as to ESG performance. The world's financial markets have all leapt to provide ESG relevant ratings indexes, the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index]], the [[FTSE4Good Index]] (which is co-owned by the London Stock Exchange and Financial Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Baker &amp; McKenzie LLP |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/LSE%20ESG%20reporting.pdf |title=ESG Reporting on the London Stock Exchange |publisher=Advocates for International Development |year=2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212180604/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/LSE%20ESG%20reporting.pdf# |archive-date=12 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Bloomberg ESG data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emisoft.com/bloomberg-esg-matters/|title=Why Bloomberg ESG Data Matters|last=|first=|date=|website=Emisoft.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the  MSCI ESG Indices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msci.com/products/indices/esg/|title=MSCI ESG Indexes - MSCI|website=Msci.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the GRESB benchmarks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresb.com/gresb-assessments/|title=GRESB Assessments|website=Gresb.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some movement in the insurance market to find a reliable index of ratings for ESG issues, with some suggesting that the future lies in the construction of algorithms for calculating ESG ratings based on ISO standards and third party verification.

[[File:Without breaking stride, homeward bound commuter as the Staten Island Ferry Terminal reaches for leaflet from street... - NARA - 549907.jpg|thumb|upright|Leaflets being handed out in [[New York City]] (1973)]]
[[File:Flyers sobe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hundreds of flyers litter the streets in [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].  Scenes like these are not uncommon in cities known for their [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]]]
[[File:Helmand leaflets350.jpg|thumb|[[Airborne leaflet propaganda|Distribution of leaflets]] over [[Afghanistan]] by the U.S. military in 2010]]
[[File:Flyers in China 02.jpg|thumb|Flyers pasted to a wall in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]

A '''flyer''' is a form of [[paper]] [[advertisement]] intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. In the 2010s, flyers range from inexpensively [[photocopier|photocopied]] leaflets to expensive, glossy, full-color circulars.

==Terminology==
A flyer is also called a "flier", "circular", "handbill", "[[pamphlet]]", "poster", "lit'" (literature), "weekly ad", "catalogue" or "leaflet".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Flyers may be used by individuals, [[business]]es, not-for-profit organizations or governments to:
* Advertise an event such as a music [[concert]], [[nightclub]] appearance, [[festival]], or political [[Demonstration (people)|rally]]
* Promote a [[Good (economics)|good]]s-selling businesses such as a [[used car]] lot [[discount store]] or a [[Service (economics)|service]] business such as a [[restaurant]] or [[massage parlour]].
* Persuade people about a social, religious, or political message, as in [[evangelism]] or [[political campaign]] activities on behalf of a [[political party]] or candidate during an election. Flyers have been used in armed conflict: for example, [[airborne leaflet propaganda]] has been a tactic of [[psychological warfare]].
* Recruit members for organizations or companies.

Like [[postcard]]s, [[pamphlet]]s and small [[poster]]s, flyers are a low-cost form of [[mass marketing]] or [[communication]]. There are many different flyer formats. Some examples include:
* [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] (roughly [[letterhead]] size)
* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)
* DL ([[compliments slip]] size)
* A6 ([[postcard]] size)

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] was a pamphlet that was distributed preceding the American Revolution]]
Flyers are inexpensive to produce and they required only a basic [[printing press]] from the 18th century to the 20th century. Their widespread use intensified in the 1990s with the spread of less expensive [[desktop publishing]] systems. In the 2010s, inexpensive black and white flyers can be produced with just a [[personal computer]] and a [[computer printer]]. In the 2010s, the ordering of flyers through traditional printing services has been supplanted by [[Internet]] services. Customers send designs, review proofs online or via e-mail and receive the final products by mail.

Flyers are not a new medium: prior to the [[War of American Independence]] some colonists were outraged with the [[Stamp Act (1765)]] and gathered together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.

In the 2000s, some jurisdictions have laws or [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] banning or restricting leafleting or flyering in certain locations. Owners of private property may put up signs saying "Post No Bills"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building sites or vacant lots.

==Distribution and use==
Flyers are handed out on the [[street]] (a practice known as "flyering" or "leafleting"), distributed door-to-door through the mail, posted on [[bulletin board]]s, put under windshield wipers of cars, given away at events or on the street, or affixed to telephone poles, walls, or other surfaces. Bulletin boards are found on [[college campus]]es, in [[café]]s, community meeting houses, [[laundromat]]s and small markets. Cheap to produce, contemporary flyers are frequently produced in 300&amp;nbsp;[[paper density|g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] glossy card, whereas a leaflet might be produced on a 130&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weight paper and can be a very effective form of [[direct marketing]].

In the 2010s, some individuals and organizations send flyers through [[e-mail]], a tactic that avoids spending money on paper, printing and mailing or hiring people to post the flyers on telephone poles or hand them out. The electronic [http://www.chapmatin.com/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%be-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%aa/ flyer] may be embedded into the body of the e-mail or added as an attachment to be opened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">In a notable study of power conducted by [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] in 1959, [[Power (social and political)|power]] is divided into five separate and distinct forms.  In 1965 Raven revised this model to include a sixth form by separating the informational power base as distinct from the expert power base.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to [[social communication]] studies, ''power'' in [[social influence]] settings has introduced a large realm of research pertaining to [[persuasion]] tactics and leadership practices. Through social communication studies, it has been theorized that leadership and power are closely linked. It has been further presumed that different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in [[organizational communication]] and throughout the workforce.  In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt; They identified those five bases of power as ''coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert''. This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name=371-382&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.),Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, French and Raven defined social influence as a change in the belief, attitude, or behavior of a person (the target of influence) which results from the action of another person (an influencing agent), and they defined social power as the potential for such influence, that is, the ability of the agent to bring about such a change using available resources.&lt;ref name=1242-49&gt;Raven, Bertram H. "Power, Six Bases of." Encyclopedia of Leadership.Ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2004. 1242-49. SAGE; Reference Online. Web. 30 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there have been many formal definitions of leadership that did not include [[social influence]] and power, any discussion of leadership must inevitably deal with the means by which a leader gets the members of a group or organization to act and move in a particular direction.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

Whereby, this is to be considered "power" in social influential situations.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
The original French and Raven (1959) model included five bases of power – reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, and referent – however, informational power was added by Raven in 1965, bringing the total to six.&lt;ref name=217-244&gt;Raven, Bertram H. (1992) "A power interaction model on interpersonal influence: French and Raven thirty years later". Journal of Social Behavior and Personality. Vol. 7, No. 2, 217-244&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the model has gone through very significant developments: coercion and reward can have personal as well as impersonal forms. Expert and referent power can be negative or positive. Legitimate power, in addition to position power, may be based on other normative obligations: reciprocity, equity, and responsibility. Information may be utilized in direct or indirect fashion.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

French and Raven defined social power as the potential for influence (a change in the belief, attitude or behavior of a someone who is the target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;

As we know [[leadership]] and power are closely linked.  This model shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions.  Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control.  Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions".&lt;ref name=Lazarsfeld&gt;Lazarsfeld, Paul. Menzel, Herbert. 1961. On the relation between individual and collective properties. pp 214–249 in Amitai Etzioni (ed.), Complex Organizations: A Sociological Reader. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original typology ==
The bases of social power have evolved over the years with benefits coming from advanced research and theoretical developments in related fields. On the basis of research and evidence, there have been many other developments and elaborations on the original theory. French and Raven developed an original model outlining the change dependencies and also further delineating each power basis.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Though it is a common understanding that most social influence can still be understood by the original six bases of power, the foundational bases have been elaborated and further differentiated.

==Bases of power==
As mentioned above, there are now six main concepts of power strategies consistently studied in social communication research. They are described as Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, Expert, and Informational.  Additionally, research has shown that [[source credibility]] has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nesler, Mitchell S.; Aguinis, Herman; Quigley, Brian M.; Tedeschi, James T. (1993). "The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power". Journal of Applied Social Psychology 23 (17): 1407–1425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The bases of power differ according to the manner in which social changes are implemented, the permanence of such changes, and the ways in which each basis of power is established and maintained.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The effectiveness of power is situational. Given there are six bases of power studied in the [[Communication]] field, it is very important to know the situational uses of each power, focusing on when each is most effective.  According to French and Raven, "it is of particular practical interest to know what bases of power or which power strategies are most likely to be effective, but it is clear that there is no simple answer.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

For example, a power strategy that works immediately but relies on surveillance (for example, reward power or coercive power) may not last once surveillance ends. One organizational study found that reward power tended to lead to greater satisfaction on the part of employees, which means that it might increase influence in a broad range of situations. Coercive power was more effective in influencing a subordinate who jeopardized the success of the overall organization or threatened the leader's authority, even though in the short term it also led to resentment on the part of the target. A power strategy that ultimately leads to private acceptance and long-lasting change (for example, information power) may be difficult to implement, and consume considerable time and energy. In the short term, complete reliance on information power might even be dangerous (for example, telling a small child not to run into the street unattended). A military officer leading his troops into combat might be severely handicapped if he had to give complete explanations for each move. Instead, he would want to rely on unquestioned legitimate position power, backed up by coercive power. Power resources, which may be effective for one leader, dealing with one target or follower, may not work for a different leader and follower. The manner in which the power strategy is utilized will also affect its success or failure. Where coercion is deemed necessary, a leader might soften its negative effects with a touch of humor. There have been studies indicating that cultural factors may determine the effectiveness of power strategies."&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;
             
=== Coercive power ===
{{Also|Coercive control}}
[[File:Blackbeard, Buccaneer - Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Blackbeard the infamous pirate]]
Coercive power uses the threat of force to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] from another. Force may include physical, social, emotional, political, or economic means. Coercion is not always recognized by the target of influence.&lt;ref name=Petress&gt;{{cite web|last=Petress|first=Ken|date=2003|title=Power: Definition, Typology, Description, Examples, and Implications|format=PDF|url=http://uthscsa.edu/gme/documents/powerdefinitionstypologyexamples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is based upon the idea of [[coercion]]. The main idea behind this concept is that someone is forced to do something that he/she does not desire to do. The main goal of coercion is compliance. Coercive power's influence is socially dependent on how the target relates to the change being desired by the influence agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. Motivated Compliance With Bases of Social Power. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 1921-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a person would have to be consistently watched by the influencing agent in order for the change to remain in effect.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal coercion relates a person's belief that the influencing agent has the real power to physically threaten, impose a monetary fine or dismiss an employee.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal coercion relates to a threat of rejection or the possibility of disapproval from a person whom is highly valued.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

According to Changingminds.org "demonstrations of the harm are often used to illustrate what will happen if compliance is not gained".&lt;ref&gt;ChangingMinds. (2002–2009). Retrieved on May 5, 2009 from Changingminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The power of coercion has been proven to be related with [[Punishment (psychology)|punitive behavior]] that may be outside one's normal role expectations.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; However coercion has also been associated positively with generally punitive behavior and negatively associated to contingent [[Reward system|reward behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, D. A., &amp; Sims, H. P. Perceptions of managerial power as a consequence of managerial behavior and reputation. Journal of Management 1983, 9, 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of power can often lead to problems and in many circumstances it involves [[abuse]].  These type of leaders rely on the use of threats in their [[leadership style]]. Often the threats involve saying someone will be fired or demoted.

=== Reward power ===
{{Also|Operant conditioning|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reward power is based on the right of some to offer or deny tangible, social, emotional, or spiritual [[Reward system|rewards]] to others for doing what is wanted or expected of them. Some examples of reward power (positive reward) are: (a) a child is given a dollar for earning better grades; (b) a student is admitted into an honor society for excellent effort; (c) a retiree is praised and feted for lengthy service at a retirement party; and (d) New York firefighters were heralded as heroes for their acts on 9-11-01.[[File:Money 555.jpg|thumbnail]] Some examples of reward power (negative reward) are: (a) a driver is fined for illegal parking; (b) a teenager grounded for a week for misbehaving; (c) a rookie player is ridiculed for not following tradition; and (d) [[President Harding]]'s name is commonly invoked whenever [[political scandal]] is mentioned. Some pitfalls can emerge when a too heavy reliance is placed on reward power; these include: (a) some people become fixated and too dependent on rewards to do even mundane activities; (b) too severe fears of punishment can immobilize some people; (c) as time passes, past rewards become insufficient to motivate or activate desired outcomes; and (d) negative rewards may be perverted into positive attention.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal reward relates to promises of promotions, money and rewards from various social areas.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal reward relates to the reward of receiving approval from a desired person and building relationships with romantic partners.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===
{{Also|Legitimisation}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II - 1953-Dress.JPG|thumbnail|Queen Elizabeth II - 1953]]
Legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by [[social norms]].&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of [[obligation]] or the notion of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. (1990). Handbook of leadership (3rd ed.). New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formal power relies on position in an authority [[hierarchy]]. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref name="administration1998"&gt;Fuqua, E., Payne, K., &amp; Cangemi, J. (1998). Leadership and the effective use of power. National Forum of Educational Administration and Supervision Journal, 15E(4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation.&lt;ref name=150-167&gt;French, J. and Raven, B. (1959). The Bases of Social Power. In Studies in Social Power, D. Cartwright, Ed., pp. 150-167. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this [[Legitimation|legitimacy]] can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Legitimate power originates from a target of influence accepting the power of the influencing agent whereas behavioral change or [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] occurs based on target's obligation.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; One who uses legitimate power may have a high need for power which is their motivator to use this base for change in behavior and influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; There may be a range of legitimate power.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt;

==== Position ====
The legitimate position power is based on the social norm which requires people to be obedient to those who hold superior positions in a formal or informal social structure.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Examples may include: a [[Police legitimacy|police officer's legitimacy]] to make arrests; a parent's legitimacy to restrict a child's activities; the President's legitimacy to live in the White House; and the Congress' legitimacy to declare war. Some pitfalls can arise when too heavy reliance is placed on legitimate power; these include: (a) unexpected exigencies call for non-legitimized individuals to act in the absence of a legitimate authority – such as a citizen's arrest in the absence of a police official; and (b) military legitimacy&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Reciprocity ====
The legitimate power of reciprocity is based on the social norm of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Which states how we feel obligated to do something in return for someone who does something beneficial for us.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, A. (1960). The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement.
American Sociological Review, 47, 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). New York:
HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equity ====
The legitimate power of equity is based on the social norm of equity (or [[compensatory damages]])&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; The social norm of equity makes people feel compelled to compensate someone who has suffered or worked hard.&lt;ref&gt;Walster, E., Walster, G. W., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1978). Equity theory and
research. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as someone whom we have harmed in some way is based on the premise that there is a wrong that can be made right, which may be a compensatory form of righting the wrong.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;Berkowitz, L. and Daniels, L. (1963).  The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 66(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dependence  ====
The legitimate power of dependence is based on the social norm of [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Social responsibility norm states how people feel obligated to help someone who is in need of assistance.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz/&gt;

People traditionally obey the person with this power solely based on their role, position or title rather than the person specifically as a leader. Therefore, this type of power can easily be lost and the leader does not have his position or title anymore. This power is therefore not strong enough to be one's only form of influencing/persuading.

=== Referent power ===
{{Main article|Referent power}}
Referent power is rooted in the affiliations we make and/or the groups and organizations we belong to.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Our affiliation with a group and the beliefs of the group are shared to some degree. As Referent power emphasizes similarity, respect for an agent of influence's superiority may be undermined by a target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Use of this power base and its outcomes may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; An agent for change motivated with a strong need for affiliation and concern of likeability will prefer this power base and will influence their leadership style.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Ingratiation or flattery and sense of community may be used by an agent of influence to enhance their influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumbnail|Reagans with Rev. Billy Graham]]

==== Positive ====
Referent power in a positive form utilizes the shared personal connection or shared belief between the influencing agent and target with the intention of positively correlated actions of the target.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Negative ====
Referent power in a negative form produces actions in opposition to the intent of the influencing agent, this is the result from the agent's creation of [[cognitive dissonance]] between the referent influencing agent and the target's perception of that influence.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Examples of referent power include: (a) each of the last seven White House press secretaries have been paid handsomely for their memoirs relating to their presence at the seat of government; (b) Mrs. Hillary Clinton gained political capital by her marriage to the President; (c) Reverend Pat Robertson lost a bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President due, in significant part, to his religious affiliation; and (4) national firefighters have received vocational acclaim due to the association with the heroic NYC firefighters. Some pitfalls can occur related to referent assumptions; these include: (a) guilt or glory by association where little or no true tie is established; (b) associative traits tend to linger long after real association ends; (c) some individuals tend to pay dearly for associates' misdeeds or terrible reputations.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; It is important to distinguish between referent power and other bases of social power involving control or [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Fuqua, Payne, and Cangemi, referent power acts a little like [[role model]] power. It depends on respecting, liking, and holding another individual in high esteem. It usually develops over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="administration1998"/&gt;

The power of holding the ability to administer to another a sense of personal acceptance or personal approval.&lt;ref name=Hinkin&gt;Hinkin, T. R., &amp; Schriesheim, C. A. Development and application of new scales to measure the bases of social power. Journal of Applied Psychology, 1989 74, 561-567.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is strong enough that the power-holder is often looked up to as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, B. H. Political applications of the psychology of interpersonal influence and social power. Political Psychology, 1990, 11, 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is often regarded as admiration, or charm. The responsibility involved is heavy and the power easily lost, but when combined with other forms of power it can be very useful. Referent power is commonly seen in political and military figures, although celebrities often have this as well.

=== Expert power===
[[File:Julius Richmond, Surgeon General official photo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Julius Richmond]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]]]]
Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or talents.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying [[expertise]], and actions.  The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert power if the motive is a need for achievement.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; The ability to administer to another information, knowledge or expertise.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; (Example: Doctors, lawyers). As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince their subordinates to trust them.  The expertise does not have to be genuine – it is the [[perception]] of expertise that provides the power base.  When individuals perceive or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power to that person.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Positive ====
Expert power in a positive form influences the target to act accordingly as instructed by the expert, based on the assumption of the expert's correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

====  Negative ====
Expert power in a negative form can result from a person acting in opposition to the experts instructions if the target feels that the expert has personal gain motives.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Some examples include: (a) a violinist demonstrating through audition skill with music; (b) a professor submits school transcripts to demonstrate discipline expertise; (c) a bricklayer relies on 20+ years of experience to prove expertise. Some pitfalls can emerge when too heavy a reliance is made on expertise; these include: (a) sometimes inferences are made suggesting expertise is wider in scope than it actually is; for example, an expert in antique vases may have little expertise in antique lamps; (b) one's expertise is not everlasting; for example, a physician who fails to keep up with medical technology and advances may lose expertise; and (c) expertise does not necessarily carry with it [[common sense]] or [[ethics|ethical judgement]].&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

=== Informational power ===
French and Raven's original five powers brought about change after many years, by which Raven added a sixth base of power. Informational is the ability of an [[agent of influence]] to bring about change through the resource of information.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Raven arguably believed that power as a potential influence logically meant that information was a form of influence and the social power base of Information Power was derived.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence results in [[cognition]] and acceptance by the target of influence. The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; In order to establish Information Power, an agent of influence would likely provide a baseline of information to a target of influence to lay the groundwork in order to be effective with future [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; A link between informational power, control, cooperation, and satisfaction have been hypothesized and tested in a lab study. The findings indicate that a channel member's control over another's strategy increases with its informational power source.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Information power if the motive is a need for achievement and can also be affected by an agent's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Feldman summarizes informational power as the most transitory type of power. If one gives information away, then the power is given away, which differs from other forms of power because it's grounded in what you know about the content of a specific situation. Other forms of power are independent of the content.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R.S. (1985). Social Psychology: Theories, Research, and Applications.  McGraw Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information power comes as a result of possessing knowledge that others need or want.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; In the age of [[Information technology]], information power is increasingly relevant as an abundance of information is readily available.  There may be a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by an agent of influence to determine if Information Power or influence is the best strategy.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence or persuasion would generally be favorable however it may not be best suited if timing and effort lacks.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Information possessed that no one needs or wants is powerless. Information power extends to the ability to get information not presently held such as a case with a librarian or data base manager. Not all information is readily available; some information is closely controlled by few people.  Examples of information that is sensitive or limits accessibility: (a) national security data; (b) personnel information for government or business; (c) corporate trade secrets; (d) juvenile court records; (e) many privately settled lawsuit documents; (f) Swiss bank account owners; and (g) private phone conversations. Of course, legally obtained phone tap warrants, spying, eavesdropping, group and group member leaks can allow others not intended to be privy to information.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Possessing information is not, typically, the vital act; it is what one can and does do or potentially can do with the information that typically is of vital importance. Information can, and often is, used as a weapon as in a divorce, a child custody case, business dissolution, or in civil suits discoveries. Information has been used by some to extort action, utterance, agreement, or settlement by others.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Information power is a form of personal or collective power that is based on controlling information needed by others in order to reach an important goal.  Our society is now reliant on information power as knowledge for influence, decision making, credibility, and control.  Timely and relevant information delivered on demand can be the most influential way to acquire power.  Information may be readily available through public records, research, and but information is sometimes assumed privileged or confidential. The target of influence accepts,comprehends and internalizes the change independently, without have to go back to the influencing agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

Informational power is based on the potential to utilize information.  Providing rational arguments, using information to persuade others, using facts and manipulating information can create a power base.  How information is used – sharing it with others, limiting it to key people, keeping it secret from key people, organizing it, increasing it, or even falsifying it – can create a shift in power within a group.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Direct ====

Information presented by the influencing agent directly to the target of change.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Indirect ====

Information presented influencing agent indirectly to the target of change void of attempting influence, such as hints or suggestions.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Socially independent of change====

The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Power socially independent of change may reflect the target continuing changed behavior without referring to, or even remembering, the supervisor or individual of authority as an agent of change because the target understands and accepts the reasoning of information received.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

==== Accessibility ====

Raven acknowledged leaders can attempt to influence subordinates by access and control of information. Information power may be used in both personal and positional classifications and is among the most preferable power bases.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, D. E. and Stahelski, A. J. The systematic measurement of French &amp; Raven's bases of social power in workgroups. Journal of Applied Social Psychology vol. 18 (1988) pp. 375–389&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tools/mechanisms ====

Informational power includes not only possessing information, but also the ability to obtain relevant information in a timely way to amass a power base.  The use of tools or technological mechanisms such as [[internet]], smart phones, and [[Social media]] progresses society's access to information but informational power as a base is derived by determining the usefulness and appropriateness of the information.&lt;ref&gt;Dessler, G. and Phillips, J. (2008). Managing Now. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power as a function of leadership and leadership styles ==
Tradition power is that force that is exerted upon us to conform to traditional ways. Traditions, for the most part, are social constructs; they invite, seduce, or compel us to conform and act in predictable, patterned ways. Breaking with traditions put people at risk of social alienation. Traditions can blunt rationality; they can block innovation; and they can appear to outsiders as silly when original traditions' rationales become outdated or forgotten.

The power of traditions, rather than being typically vested in particular individuals, is ordinarily focused on group conformity&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Charismatic power is that aura possessed by only a few individuals in our midst; it is characterized by super confidence, typical physical attractiveness, social adroitness, amiability, sharpened leadership skills, and heightened charm. Some [[charisma]] has dark and sinister overtones such as that shown by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[David Koresh]], and many [[confidence trickster]]s. Others demonstrate more positive displays of charisma such as that displayed by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Charisma has, in many cases, short circuited rationality; that is, others have been fooled into or lulled into not rationally considering what a charismatic requests or demands but going along as a result of the charismatic attraction. It must be remembered that power is effective only when the target of powerful actions agrees [implicitly or explicitly] to the relevant power dynamic; we are all technically able to resist the power of others; at times, however, we may feel powerless to resist or the social, political, personal, and/or emotional price to be paid is too high or we fear failure in resisting&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

A '''Garibaldi shirt''' (also called "Garibaldi jacket" or "Camicia rossa") was a woman's fashion, a red wool shirt named after the Italian patriot [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] first popularized in 1860.  It was the direct ancestor of the modern women's [[blouse]].&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Young, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Anne, ''Victorian Costume and Costume Accessories'', revised second edition, Ruth Bean Publishers, Carlton, Bedford UK 1984 {{ISBN|0-903585-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington, C.

==Garibaldi's Redshirts==
[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (1807 - 1882) was an Italian folk hero, a nationalist in favor of Italian independence from Austrian domination.   Garibaldi's "total sincerity and honesty, and exceptional physical courage gave him the kind of personal magnetism which made women of all classes love him, and men of all classes follow him in circumstances of acute danger."&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Hearder, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] campaign in 1860, his volunteer followers were known as [[Redshirts (Italy)|"Redshirts"]] (''Camicie Rosse'' in Italian)  for their uniforms (or rather shirts, as they could not afford full uniforms), and it is these who inspired the fashion.

==The Garibaldi shirt==
According to a brief history of the [[Waist (clothing)|shirt waist]] written in 1902, the fashion for the Garibaldi shirt was initiated by [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of France.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Young, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first mention is in 1860, and clothing historian says of it: "The Garibaldi jacket, of scarlet cashmere with military trimmings of gold braid, was hailed as 'the gem of the season'."&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Cunnington, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  It was extremely popular during the first half of the 1860s.  Versions in white and lighter fabrics also appeared,&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Buck, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and children frequently wore it.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Buck, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camicia rossa==
"Camicia rossa" or red shirt is a type of clothing. The century illustrated monthly magazine, Volume 74 explains that "One...relic is none other than a veritable camicia rossa, or red shirt, worn by Garibaldi at [a] siege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FIiAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22camicia+rossa%22+clothing&amp;dq=%22camicia+rossa%22+clothing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t1DXTuGwOOLDmQXAwrz2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y | title=The century illustrated monthly magazine , Volume 74 | accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Cultural History of the Modern Age: The Crisis of the European Soul'' says that "For a considerable time [[Garibaldi]] was the most famous man in Europe, and the red shirt, la camicia rossa, became the fashion for ladies, even outside Italy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9l4X820qJekC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=%22Camicia+rossa%22+fashion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5VFowMopx&amp;sig=aKs6ONx92ZJce5TF-tyDRHVF7s0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PE7XTq-nMsqviQfz2IjdDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Camicia%20rossa%22%20fashion&amp;f=false | title=A Cultural History of the Modern Age: The Crisis of the European Soul | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=2010 | accessdate=December 1, 2011 | author=Egon Friedell &amp; Allan Janik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garibaldi Guard "Redshirts" of Union Army in American Civil War==
During the [[American Civil War]], the [[39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Garibaldi Guard]], composed of [[Europe|European]] immigrants, from [[New York City]], served in the [[Union Army]], wearing the red, Garibaldi shirts, as a part of their battle dress uniforms.

==Late and post-Victorian women's fashion==
The Garibaldi shirt was popularized in 1860 and the baggy, bloused style was worn exclusively by women and remained popular for some years, eventually turning into the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Waist (clothing)|shirt waist]] modern woman's blouse.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julia Ditto, "The Rise of the Shirt Waist", ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', May 1902, pp. 354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shirtwaist designs 1906.jpg|thumb|left|upright=3.5|The baggy, bloused style, of the Garibaldi shirt, heavily influenced the [[Victorian fashion|Late and post-Victorian fashions]] , as seen in a 1906 advertisement, in ''The Modern Priscilla'', a needlework magazine, showing 16 different designs for [[waist (clothing)|shirtwaists]], with details, about patterns and materials.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7279">The '''Global Corruption Report''' is one of [[Transparency International]]'s flagship publications, bringing together experts from all over the world to discuss and analyze corruption in a specific sector. Most recent reports have focused on corruption in climate change, the private sector, water and the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transparency.org/research/gcr&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it is in its eleventh year of publication. It began in 2001 simply as a collection of research on global corruption. But, since 2003, has grown into a report dedicated to providing information and solutions to corruption in various areas. The forthcoming report focuses on corruption in education and will be released 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transparency.org/research/gcr/gcr_education&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aim==

Corruption is a global ethical and legal issue and is defined by Transparency International as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. The aim of the Global Corruption Report is to bring the matter of corruption to the attention of the world and aid in combating it. It is also designed as a tool to help policymakers and the public to change corrupt behaviour by providing guidelines and recommendations within the report. The Global Corruption Report uses various sources of information including experts and activists, as well as up to date research, in order to bring to the fore the recent developments in corruption. The report also addresses international and regional trends, highlights significant cases and uses the [[Bribe Payers Index]] and the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] as empirical evidence of corruption. The report provides an assessment of corruption within more than 30 countries, as well as research findings and perspectives, and it is designed to be useful to a broad range of readers. This includes policymakers, journalists, educators, students as well as the general public.

Each year the report focuses on a particular sector and examines the prevalence of corruption within that sector around the world. By focusing on one sector the report further underlines the seriousness of corruption and the need for change to be implemented. It also emphasises how corruption in that sector affects the people and economy of those affected countries. The report helps to expose what may be lacking in the policies of those nations and encourages them to put in place better policies and processes. In reviewing the policies related to one sector, this may further encourage policymakers to review other sectors and implement change throughout.

==Examples==

In previous reports, the 2007 Global Corruption Report focused on [[judicial corruption]] and its effect on the justice system as a whole. It also assessed the pressures applied to judges and courts by politicians, society and economic conditions. The report reviewed where and why corruption in the judicial system is occurring. It also gave details on efforts to reduce judicial corruption as well as recommendations for judiciary participants to avoid and eradicate corruption in their own country. The 2007 report stressed the need for judicial systems to remain “clean” and maintain integrity, accountability and transparency. Only by doing so can the judiciary act without undue influence and ensure the basic human right to a fair trial is upheld.

The 2006 Global Corruption Report focused on corruption in the health sector and how public money may be an enticement to corruption. It also discussed corruption in the pharmaceutical chain, as well as in hospital administration, while also highlighting the various forms that corruption takes in the health sector around the world. The report also offered perspectives on the people of countries affected by such corruption and the effect on their health. The 2005 Global Corruption Report focused on how corruption in the construction sector and post-conflict reconstruction undermines economic development. This report included a particular focus on [[Iraq]] and the rebuilding that was necessary after the war. The report also reviewed the [[economic cost]] and environmental effect of corruption within the construction industry. It covered financing of corruption with a specific look at multilateral development banks and export credit agencies world wide. The 2004 report focused on [[political corruption]] and how political and party finances play an influential role on the levels of corruption globally. The report examines the role of disclosure in the prevention of corruption in the political sector as well as discussing corporate contributions, vote buying and legal hurdles encountered by politicians.

The Global Corruption Reports are not designed to merely emphasise the extent of corruption and how it affects processes. They also demonstrate how reforms and activism can help remedy a system tainted by corruption. The reports have a vast array of contributors giving perspectives from various points of view and levels of experience in dealing with corruption. This assists in maintaining objectivity throughout the report and ensures it does not just act as an advertisement for the interests of Transparency International in eradicating corruption. While it is clear throughout the reports that the underlying theme is to help stop corruption occurring in the world wide domain, the Global Corruption Reports are not just propaganda.

==Availability==

All of the Global Corruption Reports from are available via download from the Transparency International website or by ordering from Transparency International. This allows anyone from around the world the ability to access the reports and ensures the latest research, developments and guidelines are available to the world at all times. By making the reports readily available it means that any individual in any part of the world can assess the state of corruption within their own country. This is the first step in bringing about change or encouraging countries to continue to operate in a corruption free environment.

'''Gyorin''' (lit. "neighborly relations") was a [[neo-Confucian]] term developed in [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] [[Korea]].  The term was intended to identify and characterize a diplomatic policy which establishes and maintains amicable relations with neighboring states.  It was construed and understood in tandem with a corollary term, which was the ''[[Sadaejuui|sadae]]'' or "serving the great" policy towards [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]].&lt;ref&gt;Yim Min-Hyeok. [http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?arid=1160482  "The Establishment of Literati Governance Society in Early Joseon, and Its Continuation,"] ''The Review of Korean Studies,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (June 20050, pp. 223-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucian learning contributed in the formation of ''gyorin'' and ''sadae'' as ritual, conceptual and normative frameworks for construing interactions and political decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Steben, Barry D.  [http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/11.1/11.1steben39-60.pdf.  "The Transmission of Neo-Confucianism to the Ryukyu (Liuqiu) Islands and Its Historical Significance: Ritual and Rectification of Names in a Bipolar Authority Field," p. 54.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[National University of Singapore]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-national foreign policy==
The rationale expressed by ''gyorin'' was applied to a multi-national foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b10s4187a 사대교린  (조선 외교), Britannica online Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholarly writing about the Joseon dynasty has tended to focus on diplomatic relations with China and [[Japan]], but the intermediary nature of ''gyorin'' contacts—for example, Joseon-Ryukyuan diplomatic and trading contacts—were important as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil.

The Joseon kingdom made every effort to maintain a friendly bilateral relationship with China for reasons having to do with both ''[[realpolitik]]'' and a more idealist Confucian worldview wherein China was seen as the center of a Confucian moral universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mansourov, Alexandre Y. [http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/174/43/ "Will Flowers Bloom without Fragrance? Korean-Chinese Relations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108074830/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/174/43/ |date=2008-01-08 }} ''Harvard Asia Quarterly'' (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseon diplomacy was no less aware and sensitive to ''realpolitik'' in the implementation of ''gyorin'' policy.

'''Hul Jharkhand Party''', a [[political party]] in [[India]]. Founded by Justin Richard on December 28, 1968, after the fragmentation of the [[Jharkhand Party]]. The party worked amongst the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] populations. It demanded a separate tribal-majority state and social reform. A splinter group, the [[Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party]] was later founded by [[Sibu Soren]].

A '''hung parliament''' is a term used in legislatures under the [[Westminster system]] to describe a situation in which no particular [[political party]] or pre-existing [[coalition]] (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an [[absolute majority]] of [[legislator]]s (commonly known as members or seats) in a [[parliament]] or other [[legislature]]. This situation is also known, albeit less commonly, as a '''balanced parliament''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush | date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP puts case for hung parliament | date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a legislature under '''no overall control''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507 | work=Reuters | title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election? | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hung up on 'no overall control' | first=Akash | last=Paun | date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron |title=Welcome to the era of no overall control |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can result in a [[minority government]]. The term is not relevant in [[multi-party system]]s where it is rare for a single party to hold a majority.

In the Westminster System, in the circumstance of a hung parliament, no party or coalition has an automatic [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to assume control of the [[executive branch|executive]] – a status usually known in parliamentary systems as "forming (a) government". However, an absolute majority may still be gained through the formation of a new [[coalition government]], or the addition of previously unaffiliated members to a pre-existing coalition. However, a [[minority government]] may instead result: that is, the party that has the most members is allowed to form government without an absolute majority, provided that it has the express, ongoing support of unaffiliated members, such as [[minor parties]] and/or [[independent (politician)|independent]] legislators.

==Overview==
A normal objective of [[parliamentary system]]s – especially those requiring [[responsible government]], such as the [[Westminster system]] – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass  motions of [[confidence and supply]], especially [[Motion of no confidence|motions of no-confidence]] and [[budget bill]]s). If such motions fail, they normally result in the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]], it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term hung parliament is most often used of parliaments dominated by [[two-party system|two major parties or coalitions]]. [[General election]]s in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen by all parties and observers as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], the term "hung parliament" is usually used only with respect to the [[lower house]].

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislators elected by [[proportional representation]] or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal election of 2005]] or the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 Italian general election]]).

==History==
===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses PR-STV, it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own.  
The last such occasion was 1977.  However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election.  Therefore, a "hung Dáil" (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament.  However he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power.  The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labours collapse, to enter government again.  Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down.  Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin due to the current leaderships Provisional IRA connections.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style "Grand Coalition" similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there.  Many members of FF considered FG too right wing to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass.  As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention.  The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD's abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority govt could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government.  This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions.  
Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:UK House of Commons 2017.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Commons following the 2017 general election. No party has a majority.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]], and that of [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been three general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October]]. The second was the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament "General election 2010 results of a hung parliament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510024408/http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament/ |date=10 May 2010 }}, PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The third one resulted from the [[snap election]] held in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|June 2017]] that had been called for by [[Theresa May]] in order to strengthen her majority heading into [[Brexit negotiations]] later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454|title=Election results 2017: UK wakes up to hung Parliament|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call [[snap election|early election]]s from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], then the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase "hung parliament" did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |author2=Stuart Wilks-Heeg |date=April 2010 |publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713091025/http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

===Canada===
{{Further|Federal minority governments in Canada}}

Three recent Canadian Parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], and [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]] Parliaments) were hung parliaments, although that term is not used in Canada.  Rather, the term "minority government" is used to describe the situation in which the party with the greatest number of seats in the House of Commons (but less than a majority) forms the Government.  The aftermath of all three of these elections was that the largest party ruled as a "[[minority government]]". Although minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament and elections held on [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2 May 2011]]. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 24-seat majority. The make-up of the 40th Canadian Parliament hung parliament resulted in the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]]. The Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, however, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] together held enough seats to have a larger plurality and reached an accord to form a minority [[coalition government]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] agreed to provide support on confidence votes. On 4 December 2008, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] granted [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] a [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year; the date was set as 26 January 2009. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying a vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html|title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper| publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205134535/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| archivedate=5 December 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Australian House of Reps Sept 2010.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Representatives elected in 2010, with a 72-72 tie between the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition.]]
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections.&lt;ref name="pgia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Government in Australia |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |year=2014 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=178308121X |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FmvUAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and The Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern.

In [[Australian federal election, 2016|the most recent election]] a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|by-election in 2018]].

Having hung Parliaments in both Australia and the United Kingdom at the same time, and also briefly including Canada as well, is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[New South Wales state election, 1991|New South Wales in 1991]], Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998]] and [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015]], [[Victorian state election, 1999|Victoria in 1999]], [[South Australian state election, 1997|South Australia in 1997]] and [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]], [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmania in 2010]].

===New Zealand===
Hung parliaments had a relatively uncommon place in New Zealand politics prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. Only on five occasions since the beginnings of modern party politics in [[New Zealand general election, 1890|1890]] has a hung parliament occurred, in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]], [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]], [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]] &amp; [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] respectively. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two party system, alternating between the long dominating [[New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bassett |first=Michael |title=Three Party Politics in New Zealand 1911–1931 |authorlink=Michael Bassett |year=1982 |publisher=Historical Publications |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-86870-006-1 |pages= 64–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]] no single party has gained an outright majority in parliament. Subsequent governments have all been formed as either coalitions or under confidence and supply agreements. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Consequences==
In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support.  Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.&lt;ref name="gpia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Government Politics in Australia |last=Fenna |first=Alan |author2=Jane Robbins |author3=John Summers |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU |isbn=1486001386 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]] if an election results in a 'hung assembly' in one of the state [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assemblies]] and no party is capable of gaining confidence then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs [[President's Rule]] (or in the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 'Governor's Rule') is applied. In [[India]] there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]] when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] won fewer seats than the opposition [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] to resign, his replacement [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and [[William Massey]] formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]] the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]] remain in office. In the next election in [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour's ever-increasing appeal as the [[Great Depression]] worsened.

[[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third party candidates). Labour's Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] agreed to become [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]] remained in office, attempting to build a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over in a minority government.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], another hung parliament occurred with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK General Election]], a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by [[Theresa May]] formed a minority government, supported by a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat.

When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.

'''''Imperium''''' is a [[Latin]] word that, in a broad sense, translates roughly as '[[Power (philosophy)|power]] to command'. In [[ancient Rome]], different kinds of power or [[authority]] were distinguished by different terms. ''Imperium'' referred to the ability of an individual to command the military.  It is not to be confused with ''[[auctoritas]]'' or ''[[potestas]]'', different and generally inferior types of power in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]].  Primarily used to refer to the power that is wielded, in greater or lesser degree, by an individual to whom it is delegated, the term could also be used with a geographical connotation, designating the territorial limits of that ''imperium''. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] or [[promagistrate]]s. These included the curule [[aedile]], the [[praetor]], the [[Roman consul|consul]], the [[magister equitum]], and the [[Roman dictator|dictator]].

== Personal characteristic ==
In ancient Rome, ''imperium'' could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, the wealth held in items, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society it was also a more formal concept of [[legal authority]]. A man with ''imperium'' ("[[imperator]]") had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his [[magistrate|magistracy]] or [[promagistrate|promagistracy]]. He could be [[veto]]ed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g. a fellow [[Roman consul|consul]]) or by one whose ''imperium'' outranked his - that is, one of ''imperium maius'' (greater ''imperium).''

Some modern [[scholar]]s such as [[A.H.M. Jones]] have defined ''imperium'' as "the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state".{{cn|date=December 2015}}

''Imperium'' can be distinguished from [[Monarchy|''regnum'']], or royal power, which was inherited. ''Imperium'' was originally a [[military]] concept, the power of the ''[[imperator]]'' (general in the army) to command. The word derives from the Latin verb, ''imperare'' (to command). The title ''imperator'' was applied to the emperor, who was the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word, ''imperator'', gives us the English word "emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of the word emperor|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/emperor|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Imperium'' was indicated in two prominent ways. A ''[[curule]]'' magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office (compare the [[field marshal]]'s baton). Any such magistrate was also escorted by ''[[lictor]]s'' bearing the ''[[fasces]]'' (traditional symbols of imperium and authority); when outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', axes were added to the ''fasces'' to indicate an imperial magistrate's power to enact capital punishment outside Rome (the axes were removed within the ''pomerium''). The number of lictors in [[attendance]] upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of ''imperium''. When in the field, a ''curule'' magistrate possessing an ''imperium'' greater or equal to that of a [[praetor]] wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his [[cuirass]]. Further, any man executing ''imperium'' within his sphere of influence was entitled to the [[curule chair]].

* Curule [[aedile]] (''aedilis curulis'') – 2 lictors
** Since a plebeian aedile (aedilis plebis) did not own imperium, he was not escorted by lictors.
* [[Magister equitum]] (the [[Roman dictator|dictator]]'s deputy) – 6 lictors
* [[Praetor]] – 6 lictors (2 lictors within the pomerium)
* [[Roman consul|Consul]] – 12 lictors each
* [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] – 24 lictors outside the Pomerium and 12 inside; starting from the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Lucius Sulla]] the latter rule was ignored.
** Because the dictator could enact capital punishment within Rome as well as without, his lictors did not remove the axes from their fasces within the pomerium.

As can be seen, dictatorial ''imperium'' was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian ''imperium'' was superior to "equine-magisterial" ''imperium''. A [[promagistrate]], or a man executing a ''curule'' office without actually holding that office, also possessed ''imperium'' in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular ''imperium'' being more or less equal to consular ''imperium'', propraetorian ''imperium'' to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of ''lictors''.

Certain extraordinary [[Commissioned officer|commissions]], such as [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]]'s famous command against the [[Piracy|pirates]], were invested with ''imperium maius'' meaning they outranked all other owners of imperium of the same type or rank (in Pompey's case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being "ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland"). ''Imperium maius'' later became a hallmark of the [[Roman emperor]].

Another technical use of the term in [[Roman law]] was for the power to extend the [[law]] beyond its mere interpretation, extending ''imperium'' from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their [[delegate]]s to the [[jurisprudence]] of [[jurisconsult]]s.

==Later==
While the Byzantine [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Roman Emperors]] retained full Roman imperium and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between ''sacerdotium'' in the person of the Pope and the secular ''imperium'' of the revived Western Roman Emperor since Charlemagne. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city Rome: the Pope, Bishop ''of Rome'', versus the Holy ''Roman'' Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps).

The [[Donatio Constantini]], by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial [[Patrimonium Petri]] in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, [[Leo IX]], cites the "Donatio" in a letter of 1054 to [[Michael Cærularius]], Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly ''imperium'', the royal priesthood. Thenceforth the "Donatio" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: [[Anselm of Lucca]] and [[Deusdedit of San Pietro in Vincoli|Cardinal Deusdedit]] inserted it in their collections of canons; [[Gratian]] excluded it from his ''Decretum'', but it was soon added to it as ''Palea''; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative.

In one bitter episode, [[Pope Gregory IX]] who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the ''imperium animarum'' 'command of the souls' (i.e. voicing God's will to the faithful) and the ''principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo'' 'princedom over all things and bodies in the whole world', while the Emperor wished to restore the ''imperium mundi'', imperium (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world — Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the [[battle of Cortenuova]] (1237), only embittered the opposition between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the "self-confessed heretic", the "blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse" (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy, i.e. the [[papal states]], et cetera.

== Divine and earthly imperium ==
In some monotheistic religions such as Christianity (the Catholic Church where the official language, Latin, used terms as ''Imperium Dei/Domini'') the Divine is held to have a superior imperium, as ultimate [[King of Kings]], above all earthly powers. Whenever a society accepts this Divine will to be expressed on earth, as by a religious authority, this can lead to [[theocratic]] legitimation. However, the Catholic Church and most other Christian groups acknowledge the authority of secular governments. If however a secular ruler controls the religious hierarchy, he can use it to legitimize his own authority.

Thus absolute, universal power was vested under early Islam in the original [[Caliphate]] (before it became the political toy of worldly powers 'behind the throne' and was even politically discarded by essentially secular princes), and later again claimed by [[Mahdi]]s.

The chief minister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] suggested removal of the Roman Catholic papacy's ''[[imperium in imperio]]'' (Latin for "state within a state") by requesting that Parliament pass the [[Act in Restraint of Appeals]] (1533) specifying that England was an empire and that [[The Crown]] was imperial, and a year later the [[Act of Supremacy]] proclaiming the [[Imperial Crown]] Protector and Supreme Head of the [[Church of England]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In Orthodox Russia too, when [[Peter I the Great]] assumed the Byzantine imperial titles ''Imperator'' and [[Autokrator]], instead of the royal Tsar, the idea in founding the [[Russian Holy Synod]] was to put an end to the old ''Imperium in imperio'' of the free Church, by substituting the synod for the all too independent [[Patriarch of Moscow]], which had become almost a rival of the Tsars — Peter meant to unite all authority in himself, over Church as well as State: through his [[Ober-Procurator]] and synod, the Emperor ruled his Church as absolutely as the military through their respective ministries; he appointed its members just as he did generals; and the Russian Government continued his policy until the end of the empire in 1917.

'''''Jus exclusivae''''' ([[Latin]] for "right of exclusion"; sometimes called the '''papal veto''') was the right claimed by several [[Catholic]] [[monarch]]s of [[Europe]] to veto a candidate for the [[Pope|papacy]]. The [[French monarchy|French monarch]], the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish monarch]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and the [[Emperor of Austria]] claimed this right at various times, making known to a [[papal conclave]], through a [[crown-cardinal]], that the monarch deemed a particular candidate for the papacy objectionable.

==Early history==
The right exercised by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperors and Holy Roman Emperors to confirm the election of a Pope, which was last exercised in the [[Early Middle Ages]], appears unrelated to the legal claim of ''jus exclusivae'', during the 17th century, when [[treatise]]s in defence of this right first appear. Spain, which ruled much of Italy at the time, raised the claim in 1605 and again in 1644 at the conclave that elected Cardinal [[Pope Innocent X|Giovanni Battista Pamphili]] (who became [[Pope Innocent X]]) to exclude Cardinal Sacchetti.

== Papal attitude toward the ''jus exclusivae'' ==
The right has never been formally recognized by the papacy, though conclaves have considered it expedient to recognize secular objections to certain ''[[papabile|papabili]]'', that is, candidates for the papacy, and to accept secular interference as an unavoidable abuse. By the [[papal bull]] ''In eligendis'' of 9 October 1562 [[Pope Pius IV]] ordered the cardinals to elect a pope without deference to any secular power. The bull ''Aeterni Patris Filius'' (of 15 November 1621) forbids cardinals to conspire to exclude any candidate. These pronouncements however, did not specifically condemn the ''jus exclusivae''. In the apostolic constitution ''In hac sublimi''  of 23 August 1871 [[Pope Pius IX]] forbad any kind of secular interference in papal elections.

The most recent attempt to exercise the right to exclude [[Cardinal Rampolla]] in 1903 was rejected by the conclave, although over the course of several ballots Rampolla, who had been the leading candidate, lost support until the conclave elected Cardinal Sarto, [[Pius X]]. The following year, Pius X forbad the ''jus exclusivae'' in the  apostolic constitution ''Commissum Nobis''  of 20 January 1904:

{{Quote|Wherefore in virtue of holy obedience, under threat of the Divine judgment, and pain of excommunication [[latae sententiae]]… we prohibit the cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, all and single, and likewise the Secretary of the Sacred College of Cardinals, and all others who take part in the conclave, to receive even under the form of a simple desire the office of proposing the veto in whatever manner, either by writing or by word of mouth… And it is our will that this prohibition be extended… to all intercessions, etc… by which the lay powers endeavour to intrude themselves in the election of a pontiff… Let no man infringe this our inhibition… under pain of incurring the indignation of God Almighty and of his Apostles, Sts. Peter and Paul.}}

Since then the cardinals in conclave have been enjoined to take this oath: "We shall never in any way accept, under any pretext, from any civil power whatever, the office of proposing a veto of exclusion even under the form of a mere desire… and we shall never lend favour to any intervention, or intercession, or any other method whatever, by which the lay powers of any grade or order may wish to interfere in the election of a pontiff."

No power has openly attempted to exercise the right since 1903. France had become a republic in 1870. After World War I, there was no German Empire and no Austrian Empire. Spain became a republic and eventually became a constitutional monarchy. During the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 conclave]], Generalissimo [[Francisco Franco]] made an unsuccessful attempt to block the election of Cardinal [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Montini]]. He sent the [[College of Cardinals]] some "advice" through Cardinal [[Arcadio Larraona Saralegui|Arcadio Larraona]], a native of Spain who was then the Prefect of the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites|Congregation of Rites]]. It was carefully drafted to fall outside the forms of influence that Pius X had prohibited, but the cardinals nevertheless thought it outrageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burkle-Young|first1=Francis A.|title=Papal Elections in the Age of Transition, 1878-1922|date=2000|publisher=Lexington Books| page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QxJMdp6FMC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Just after the conclave ended, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported: "A report before the beginning of the conclave that Generalissimo Francisco Franco had asked the six Spanish cardinals to prevent Cardinal Montini's elevation was emphatically denied.

The '''Karelian question''' or '''Karelian issue''' ({{lang-fi|Karjala-kysymys}}) is a dispute in [[Politics of Finland|Finnish politics]] over whether or not to try to regain control over [[Finnish Karelia]] and other territories ceded to the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]]. Despite the name "Karelian question", the term may refer also to the return of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], ceded parts of [[Salla]] and [[Kuusamo]], and four islands in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Sometimes the phrase "debate on the return of the ceded territories" (''luovutettujen alueiden palautuskeskustelu'') is used. The Karelian question remains a matter of public debate rather than a political issue.

== History ==
The Karelian question arose when Finland was forced to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]] in the [[Moscow peace treaty]] in 1940. Most [[Finnish citizen]]s were [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated from the ceded areas]]. Most of them returned during the [[Continuation War]] and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be  completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm Karjalan suomalaistilojen korvaukset Sodan jälkeeen.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061845/http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Reino Paju 9-15-2003.

Retrieved 1-30-2008. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vast majority of the evacuees who had to settle in the rest of Finland were from [[Finnish Karelia|ceded Karelia]], the question was labeled ''The Karelian Question''. After the Winter War, Karelian municipalities and parishes established [[Karjalan Liitto]] (the Karelian Association) to defend the rights of Karelians in Finland.

[[Image:Evacuees from East-Finland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|Evacuees]] from [[Muolaa]] moving towards Western Finland during winter 1940.]]

During the [[Cold War]], the Karelian-born Finnish politician [[Johannes Virolainen]] lobbied for the return of Karelia. President [[Urho Kekkonen]] also tried to reacquire the territory, especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of [[Porkkala]] to Finland in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/kotimaa/42054.html Kekkonen nosti Karjala-kysymyksen esiin 1968] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094825/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/arkisto/kotimaa/42054.html |date=2008-04-08 }} (''Kekkonen raised Karelia question in 1968'') {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, no significant public controversy about the case, because Kekkonen wanted to keep it quiet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saunalahti.fi/~ptoukkar/lukali.htm#osa69a Kekkonen kehottaa karjalaisia vaitioloon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017211546/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~ptoukkar/lukali.htm |date=2007-10-17 }} (''Kekkonen suggest to  be quiet'') {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last time Kekkonen tried to raise it was in 1972, but he had no success, and public discussion died out in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=172062&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Saimaa Canal links two Karelias] – ThisisFINLAND&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]], the Karelian question re-surfaced. According to an article by the Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' in August 2007, the Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] unofficially offered to sell ceded Karelia to Finland in 1991 but was declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135229551051 Report: Unofficial offers by Russia in 1991 to return ceded Karelia to Finland] - ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' August 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to many Finnish political leaders and the Russian vice Prime Minister of the time, there were no such offers, only unofficial probing of the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Koiviston Karjala-selvitys outo asia ulkopolitiikan sisäpiirille STT 15.08.2007 [http://www.kaleva.fi/plus/juttu674074_page0.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esko Aho: Karjalan palautus ei kuulosta uskottavalta.

This price was set at 15 billion US dollars. According to Fyodorov, Finnish president [[Mauno Koivisto]] and Finnish foreign minister [[Paavo Väyrynen]] were aware of these unofficial discussions.&lt;ref&gt;HS: [http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135230075337 Fyodorov: Koivisto ja Väyrynen tiesivät Karjala-tunnusteluista] 5.9.2007, accessed 13.3.2008 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:street in Vyborg.jpg|thumb|Many Finnish era buildings remain in [[Vyborg]].]]
[[Karjalan Liitto]] is an interest group of Karelian evacuees which hopes that Karelia will once again become part of Finland at some point, but does not openly demand it. Some smaller groups, such as [[ProKarelia]], continue to campaign for the peaceful return of Karelia. However, no serious political party has openly supported this goal, and Finnish politicians generally say there is no need for it, citing Finland's peace treaty with Russia. There are some individual politicians who support the return of Karelia, such as [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Ari Vatanen]], and two candidates in the [[Finnish presidential election, 2006|presidential election of 2006]]: [[Timo Soini]] and [[Arto Lahti]]. Other candidates have stated that Finland has signed a [[peace treaty]] and should not campaign for the return of what are now Russian-developed territories.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic Diary.

=== Official opinions ===
Both Russia and Finland have repeatedly stated that no open territorial dispute exists between the two countries. Finland's official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations, although there is currently no need to hold open talks, as Russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded areas, or discussing the question. In 1994 [[Boris Yeltsin]] commented that "seizure of Finnish Karelia" was an example of Stalin's totalitarian and aggressive politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formin.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=53731&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI Valtiosihteeri Jukka Valtasaaren puhe Karjalan Liitto ry:n seminaarissa 19.5.1998 Helsingissä]. (Speech by ''valtiosihteeri'' Jukka Valtasaari. Finnish Foreign Ministry 1998-05-19. Retrieved 2015-08-15. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1997 he stated that the matter was closed. In 2000 President Putin stated that such discussions may endanger Finnish–Russian relations, and in 2001 he said that "changing borders is not the best way to resolve problems", but that possible solutions would be "integration and cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prozorov: Border Regions and the Politics of EU-Russian Relations, p. 4. January 2004 [http://www.euborderconf.bham.ac.uk/publications/files/WP3EuropesNorth.pdf], Helsingin Sanomat 9/5/2001 {{cite web |url=http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010904IE3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930072238/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20010904IE3 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- please notice, that this ref is for the whole paragraph --&gt;

In 1998 [[President of Finland|Finnish President]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] said that "Finland's official position is that it does not have territorial demands on Russia. However, if Russia wants to discuss returning the ceded areas, Finland is ready for that."&lt;ref&gt;Martti Ahtisaari. In press meeting, Kuopio 30 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other politicians holding government office, such as the former foreign minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]] and prime minister [[Matti Vanhanen]], have made statements along the same lines.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomioja's reply to [[Risto Kuisma]]'s question in Eduskunta [http://www.ristokuisma.net/html/kuisma2004/ristokuisma041222.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matti Vanhanen in [[YLE]]'s "Pääministerin haastattelutunti" (Interview of the Prime Minister) on 21 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polls and popular opinion===
The latest polls show that approximately 26% to 38% of Finns would like to see Karelia return to Finnish control and some 51% to 62% would oppose such a move. In Russia, people associate the word "Karelia" with the [[Republic of Karelia]] instead of [[Finnish Karelia]], which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by [[MTV3]], 34% of the people of [[Vyborg]] supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. [[Vyborg]] and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the [[Republic of Karelia]] nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.

In the latest poll in Finland about the question, 36 percent of Finns supported the return of ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper ''Karjala'' and the research institute ''MC-Info Oy'' on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' and Suomen [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]], determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return.&lt;ref name="HS Gallup"&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101980677358 HS-Gallup: Selvä enemmistö ei halua Karjalaa takaisin]&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing. A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by [[ProKarelia]] for asking [[leading questions]], such as, "Do you support the return of Karelia, even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&amp;article_id=696&amp;author=10 Eg. ProKarelia's article on 17 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances (2.1% of all replies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus, poll] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the people who were born in Karelia and were evacuated want Karelia to become part of Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="HS Gallup"/&gt; Former President [[Mauno Koivisto]] was against a discussion about the question.&lt;ref&gt;Koivisto halusi vaientaa kokonaan keskustelun Karjalan palauttamisesta.

== Problems and arguments ==

=== Price ===
[[Image:Svetogorsk.jpg|thumb|right|Blocks of flats built in the Soviet era in [[Svetogorsk]] (Enso)]]
One of the main reasons for opposing the return is the fear of the costs it would bring. According to another poll conducted by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.

The costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion [[euro]].&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;[http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=reform  ProKarelia's Reform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?/arkisto/Arkisto_1999/3.joulukuu/base+1643  Karjalan palauttamisen lasketaan kannattavan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094839/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?%2Farkisto%2FArkisto_1999%2F3.joulukuu%2Fbase+1643 |date=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arto Lahti's lecture in Karjala seminar 23 August 2005 [http://prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&amp;article_id=656&amp;author=65 abridgement]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
[[Image:Sortavalan maaseutua.jpg|thumb|Countryside houses. A picture from [[Sortavala]].]]
The area is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia, and their descendants. The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to the poll by ''Helsingin Sanomat'', 14% of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland. In 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_04_2.htm 2004 Russian Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be [[deportation|expelled]] to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so.&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.

'''Liberalism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[moral philosophy]] based on [[liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;"liberalism In general, the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice." ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, Third edition 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"political rationalism, hostility to autocracy, cultural distaste for conservatism and for tradition in general, tolerance, and [...] individualism".

Liberalism became a distinct [[Political movement|movement]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when it became popular among [[Western world|Western]] philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[Nobility|hereditary privilege]], [[state religion]], [[absolute monarchy]], the [[divine right of kings]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]] with [[representative democracy]] and the [[rule of law]]. Liberals also ended [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies, [[Legal monopoly|royal monopolies]] and other [[Trade barrier|barriers to trade]], instead promoting free markets.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, arguing that each man has a [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]] to [[life, liberty and property]],&lt;ref&gt;"All mankind [...] being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions", John Locke, ''Second Treatise of Government''&lt;/ref&gt; adding that governments must not violate these [[rights]] based on the [[social contract]]. While the [[Gladstonian liberalism|British liberal tradition]] has emphasised expanding democracy, [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|French liberalism]] has emphasised rejecting [[authoritarianism]] and is linked to [[Nationalism|nation-building]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"&gt;Kirchner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Revolution]] of 1776 and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal [[tyranny]]. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across [[Liberalism in Europe|Europe]] and [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|South America]], whereas it was well-established alongside [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in the [[Liberalism in the United States|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC&amp;pg=PA237|year=2007|publisher=Brill|page=237|isbn=9004160523}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Victorian Britain]], it was used to critique the political establishment, appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2017|volume=50|pages=677–699|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863|url=https://www.academia.edu/31947844/The_Politics_of_Cognition_Liberalism_and_the_Evolutionary_Origins_of_Victorian_Education_British_Journal_for_the_History_of_Science_50_2017_677_699}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 19th and early 20th century, [[Liberalism in Turkey|liberalism in the Ottoman Empire]] and Middle East influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]] as well as the rise of secularism, [[constitutionalism]] and [[nationalism]]. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within [[Islam]], which continues to this day, leading to [[Islamic revivalism]]. Before 1920, the main ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from new opponents: [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. However, during the 20th century liberal ideas also spread even further—especially in Western Europe—as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Conway. "The Limits of an Anti-liberal Europe". In {{cite book|author=Dieter Gosewinkel, ed.|title=Anti-liberal Europe: A Neglected Story of Europeanization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECIfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184|year=2014|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=184|isbn=9781782384267|quote=Liberalism, liberal values and liberal institutions formed an integral part of that process of European consolidation.

In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (1956) from: ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). "Liberalism in the U.S. usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any other country, save possibly Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Liberal Party|liberal parties]] continue to wield power and influence [[Liberalism by country|throughout the world]]. However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of [[Modernity|contemporary society]] have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [[constitution]]al [[government]] and [[parliament]]ary authority.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"&gt;Gould, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]], such as  [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]]; an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]] and public [[Jury trial|trial by jury]]; and the abolition of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privileges.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.&lt;ref name="Worell470"&gt;Worell, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals have [[Advocacy|advocated]] gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [[Civil rights movements|global civil rights movement]] in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between [[moderate]]s and [[Progressivism|progressives]], with the moderates tending to [[elitism]] and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as [[universal suffrage]], [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and the expansion of [[Property|property rights]]. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"/&gt;

== Etymology and definition ==
Words such as [[wikt:Liberal|liberal]], [[wikt:Liberty|liberty]], [[wikt:Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[libertine]] all trace their history to the Latin ''[[wikt:Liber|liber]]'', which means "[[wikt:Free|free]]".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"&gt;Gross, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded instances of the word "liberal" occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the [[liberal arts]] in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; The word's early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of different denotations and connotations. "Liberal" could refer to "free in bestowing" as early as 1387, "made without stint" in 1433, "freely permitted" in 1530 and "free from restraint"—often as a pejorative remark—in the 16th and the 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], "liberal" could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of "a liberal villaine" who "hath [...] confest his vile encounters".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as "free from narrow prejudice" in 1781 and "free from bigotry" in 1823.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 1815, the first use of the word "liberalism" appeared in English.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, "liberal" was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', "Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the meaning of the word "liberalism" began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].

Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word "liberalism" in North America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, p. 142. "After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 106–07. [Talking about the Democratic Party] "Its liberalism is for the most part the later version of liberalism – modern liberalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 3. "Modern liberalism occupies the left-of-center in the traditional political spectrum and is represented by the Democratic Party in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Liberalism—both as a political current and an intellectual tradition—is mostly a modern phenomenon that started in the 17th century, although some liberal philosophical ideas had precursors in [[classical antiquity]] and in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]].&lt;ref name="BevirSAGE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"/&gt; The [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] praised, "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also recognised a number of principles familiar to contemporary liberals in the works of several [[Sophism|Sophists]] and in the ''Funeral Oration'' by [[Pericles]].&lt;ref name="Young, pp. 25–6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal philosophy symbolises an extensive intellectual tradition that has examined and popularised some of the most important and controversial principles of the modern world. Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing "richness and diversity", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major themes ===
{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}
Though all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"/&gt; The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous adjectives that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term "liberalism", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.

Political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"&gt;Gray, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it "has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&amp;nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"/&gt; Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical and modern ===
Enlightenment philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"&gt;Delaney, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"&gt;Godwin et al., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature—a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state—he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life—[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them—required the formation of a "sovereign" authority with universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: "Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: "In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Zvesper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that "conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women".&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"&gt;Kerber, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt; Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt;

[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]
Locke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single "[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [[Presbyterian]] politician and poet [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Bornkamm | language = German | contribution = Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1962}}, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 942&lt;/ref&gt; Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As assistant to [[Oliver Cromwell]], Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the [[Independent politician|independents]] (''Agreement of the People''; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a consequence of democratic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Wertenbruch | contribution = Menschenrechte | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | language = German | place = Tübingen, DE | year = 1960}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 869&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech—"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in "[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.

In a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.&lt;ref name="Young 30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing "government even in its best state is a necessary evil".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the project to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31" /&gt; Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"&gt;Gould, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"/&gt;

Beyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have obsessed over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, "the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"/&gt; Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Hill Green]] was an influential [[List of liberal theorists|liberal philosopher]] who in ''Prolegomena to Ethics'' (1884) established the first major foundations for what later became known as [[positive liberty]] and in a few years his ideas became the [[Liberal welfare reforms|official policy]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|Britain]], precipitating the rise of social liberalism and the modern [[welfare state]]]]
The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|in Britain]] and was based on the following core concepts: [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''laissez-faire'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, a new conception of liberty entered the liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"&gt;Adams, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"/&gt; Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Wempe, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Rather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]]. In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the "[[tyranny of the majority]]", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"/&gt;

Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt; Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt;

To contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning "the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt; Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt;

=== Liberal economic theory ===
{{main|Economic liberalism}}
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778&lt;/ref&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"/&gt;

Smith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 69"&gt;Mills, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's iron law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several liberals, including Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.

[[Utilitarianism]] provided the [[Legitimacy (political)|political justification]] for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.

==== Keynesian economics ====
{{main|Keynesian economics}}
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]

During the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to it was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946). Keynes had been "brought up" as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal.&lt;ref&gt;See studies of Keynes by, e.g., [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], Donald Moggridge, and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's [[austerity]] measures [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|during the Great Depression]]. He believed that [[budget deficit]]s were a good thing, a product of [[recession]]s. He wrote: "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]].&lt;ref name="Skid30s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman|year=2003|isbn=0-330-488678|pages=494–500, 504, 509–510|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', was published in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a theoretical justification for the [[Economic interventionism|interventionist policies]] Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that "[[supply creates its own demand]]" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[[aggregate demand]]" and "[[aggregate supply]]" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"/&gt; Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again—a "prime the pump" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal feminist theory ===
{{main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]
[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [[gender equality]], claiming that the continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that society holds the false belief that women are by nature [[Gender inequality|less intellectually and physically capable]] than men; thus it tends to [[Sexism|discriminate against women]] in the [[Sexism in academia|academy]], the forum and the [[Occupational sexism|marketplace]]. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie. 1989. Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction. Oxon, United Kingdom: Unwin Human Ltd. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[List of women philosophers|philosopher]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) is widely regarded as the pioneer of liberal feminism, with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the political structure of liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Falco, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In her writings such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft "denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/|title=Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Brink|first=David|date=9 October 2007|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Charles de Sismondi.png|thumb|upright|[[Sismondi]] in 1819 wrote the first critique of the free market from a liberal perspective]]
[[Jean Charles Léonard Simonde de Sismondi]]'s ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population'' (1819) represents the first comprehensive liberal critique of early capitalism and laissez-faire economics, and his writings, which were studied by [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] among many others, had a profound influence on both liberal and socialist responses to the failures and contradictions of industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Ross E. |title=Sismondi's Forgotten Ethical Critique of Early Capitalism |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=1984 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spiegel |first1=Henry William |title=The Growth of Economic Thought |date=1991 |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stedman Jones, Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l'Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

The ideal of the [[Self-made man|self-made individual]], who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]] and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some [[Victorian literature|Victorian writers]], including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]], became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an [[equal opportunity]] of success.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]
[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of liberty, influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), "The Contest in America". Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Volume 24. Issue 143. pp. 683–684. Harper &amp; Bros. New York. April 1862.

Another early liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Seeing the effects of alcohol, he believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., "T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation", ''History of Political Thought'', 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'' (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt; Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.

The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; It supports a [[mixed economy]] that includes both [[public property|public]] and private property in [[capital good]]s.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G.

=== Anarcho-capitalist theory ===
{{main|Anarcho-capitalism}}
[[File:Gustavedemolinari.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819–1912)]]
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1863) b 269.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julius Faucher]] (1820–1878)]]
[[Classical liberalism]] advocates [[free trade]] under the rule of law.  [[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of [[privatizing]] protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Molinari-1849"&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QjP50k9o?url=http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (trans. J. Huston McCulloch). Retrieved 15 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]]. However, the first person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was [[Murray Rothbard]], who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School]] of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]], [[private property]] and [[free markets]]. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of [[statute]] (law by [[decree]] or [[legislation]]), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a "[[voluntary society]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morris |first=Andrew |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n8 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=13–14 |quote= |ref= |chapter=Anarcho-Capitalism |title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;sa=X&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[law enforcement]], [[court]]s and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through [[taxation]]. [[Money]], along with all other [[goods and services]], would be [[free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an [[open market]]. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based [[dispute resolution organizations]] under [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.&lt;ref name="libertarianpapers"&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers VOL. 3, ART.

[[File:John Locke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]] was the first to develop a liberal philosophy, including the [[Right to property|right to private property]] and the [[consent of the governed]]]]
Isolated strands of liberal thought had existed in [[Western philosophy]] since the [[Ancient Greeks]] and in [[Eastern philosophy]] since the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Edmund S.

These ideas began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]s. The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC|year=2007|publisher=Brill|pages=237–38|isbn=90-04-16052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.

In Europe, liberalism has a long tradition dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;German songs like ''[[Die Gedanken sind frei]]'' (''Thoughts Are Free'') can be dated even centuries before that.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution began in 1789. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions as well as the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]] and equality under the law for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; His most lasting achievement, the [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]], served as "an object of emulation all over the globe",&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the "natural order".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution in Britain.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"/&gt; [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"/&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and [[popular sovereignty]]. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]], liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led to [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ardao, "Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515–522.

Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]]; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the [[Young Ottomans]] and [[Islamic Modernism]]. Prominent of the era were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]], [[Namık Kemal]] and [[İbrahim Şinasi]]. However, the reformist ideas and trends did not reach the common population successfully as the books, periodicals and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class while many [[Muslim]]s saw them as foreign influences on the [[Liberalism and progressivism in the Muslim world|world of Islam]].

[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible. Victorian writers like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]] were early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"/&gt;

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in the [[First World War]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]".

In the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195116224|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moaddel1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226533336|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521779332 |page=496 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LorentzIran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

In the United States, [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] traces its history to the popular presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who initiated the [[New Deal]] in response to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and won an [[List of Presidents of the United States|unprecedented four elections]]. The [[New Deal coalition]] established by Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced many future American presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alterman, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide Great Depression, starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and [[communism]], especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, pp. 218–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in [[World War II]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945 and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the [[Communist state|Communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc]].

[[Liberalism in Iran|In Iran]], liberalism enjoyed wide popularity. In April 1951, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] became the governing coalition when democratically elected [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a liberal nationalist, took office as the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]]. However, his way of governing entered in conflict with Western interest and he was removed from power in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup on 19 August 1953]]. The coup ended the dominance of liberalism in the country's politics.&lt;ref name="jrisen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=Secrets of History: The C.I.A. in Iran|author=[[James Risen]]|date=16 April 2000|accessdate=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Clandestine Service History: Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran'' (March 1954). p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CN-IC-01"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781845113476|pages=775 of 1082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC&amp;pg=PA775&amp;lpg=PA775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FP 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CIA Admits It Was Behind Iran's Coup|first=Malcolm|last=Bryne|date=18 August 2013|journal=Foreign Policy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/19/cia-admits-it-was-behind-irans-coup/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The CIA's history of the 1953 coup in Iran is made up of the following documents: a historian's note, a summary introduction, a lengthy narrative account written by Dr. Donald N.

Among the various regional and national movements, the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [[Social equality|equal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Society]] project launched by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

[[File:Nizhny Novgorod. Anti-Corruption Rally (26 March 2017).jpg|thumb|[[2017 Russian protests]], organized by Russia's liberal opposition]]
The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and several [[proxy war]]s, but the widely feared [[World War III]] between the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While communist states and liberal democracies competed against one another, an [[1973 oil crisis|economic crisis]] in the 1970s inspired a move away from [[Keynesian economics]], especially under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States. This trend, called "[[neoliberalism]]" by its opponents, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century communist states in Eastern Europe [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it had been forty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Colomer, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In ''The Spirit of Democracy'', Larry Diamond argues that by 1974 "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way of the world" and that "barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free, and fair elections". Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was "predominantly democratic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Diamond|title=The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx3JTGSB5JcC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2008|publisher=Henry Holt|page=7|isbn=978-0-8050-7869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2016|publisher=Freedom House|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016?gclid=COLduYD4ys4CFVUvgQodDPkNvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has drawn both criticism and support in its history from various ideological groups. Less friendly to the goals of liberalism has been [[conservatism]]. [[Edmund Burke]], considered by some to be the first major proponent of modern conservative thought, offered a blistering critique of the French Revolution by assailing the liberal pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of all humans.&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"&gt;Grigsby, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion remains about the relationship between social liberalism and [[socialism]], despite the fact that many variants of socialism distinguish themselves markedly from liberalism by [[anti-capitalism|opposing capitalism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[private property]]. Socialism formed as a group of related yet divergent ideologies in the 19th century such as [[Christian socialism]], [[communism]] (with the writings of [[Karl Marx]]) and [[social anarchism]] (with the writings of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), the latter two influenced by the [[Paris Commune]]. These ideologies—as with liberalism and conservatism—fractured into several major and minor movements in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx rejected the foundational aspects of liberal theory, hoping to destroy both the state and the liberal distinction between society and the individual while fusing the two into a collective whole designed to overthrow the developing capitalist order of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents leading national governments in many countries.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that—in contrast with [[Marxism]]—liberal science defends [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selsam|first1=Howard|last2=Martel|first2=Harry|authorlink1=Howard Selsam|title=Reader in Marxist Philosophy|year=1963|publisher=[[International Publishers]]|isbn=0717801675|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenin|first1=Vladimir|authorlink1=Vladimir Lenin|title=On Culture and Cultural Revolution|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=1434463524|page=34|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some proponents of liberalism like [[George Henry Evans]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]] were critics of wage slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|authorlink1=Junius P.

In the same vein, conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the reckless liberal pursuit of progress and material gains, arguing that such preoccupations undermine traditional social values rooted in community and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few variations of conservatism, like [[liberal conservativism]], expound some of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism, including "small government and thriving capitalism".&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"/&gt;

[[Social democracy]], an ideology advocating progressive modification of [[capitalism]], emerged in the 20th century and was influenced by socialism. Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct through government reformism what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing inequalities,&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; social democracy was also not against the state. Several commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American liberalism "bootleg social democracy" due to the absence of a significant social democratic tradition in the United States that liberals have tried to rectify.&lt;ref&gt;Susser, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement associated with modern democracy, [[Christian democracy]], hopes to spread [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic social ideas]] and has gained a large following in some European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The early roots of Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanisation]] associated with ''laissez-faire'' liberalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complex relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually "rejects ideological thinking" altogether, largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fascism and ideology#Liberalism|Fascists accuse liberalism]] of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society – From 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 pp. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of [[private property rights]] and a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"/&gt;

Scholars have praised the influence of liberal internationalism, claiming that the rise of [[globalisation]] "constitutes a triumph of the liberal vision that first appeared in the eighteenth century" while also writing that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Venturelli, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9074">The '''Maysville Road veto''' occurred on May 27, 1830, when United States President [[Andrew Jackson]] vetoed a bill that would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] to [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] on the [[Ohio River]] (Maysville being located approximately 66 miles/106&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Lexington), the entirety of which would be in the state of [[Kentucky]]. Its advocates regarded it as a part of the national [[Cumberland Road]] system. Congress passed a bill in 1830 providing federal funds to complete the project. Jackson vetoed the bill on the grounds that federal funding of intrastate projects of this nature was unconstitutional. He declared that such bills violated the principle that the federal government should not be involved in local economic affairs. Jackson also pointed out that funding for these kinds of projects interfered with paying off the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The Jacksonian Era: 1828-1848'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1959) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of [[internal improvements]], such as the development of roads and bridges, argued that the federal government had an obligation to harmonize the nation's diverse, and often conflicting, sectional interests into an "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]." Jackson's decision was heavily influenced by his Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]]. Some authors have described the motives behind the veto decision as personal, rather than strictly political. The veto has been attributed to a personal grudge&lt;!-- Jackson's or both? --&gt; against [[Henry Clay]], a political enemy and resident of Kentucky, as well as to preserve the trade monopoly of New York's [[Erie Canal]], in Van Buren's case.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wiltse, ''The New Nation: 1800-1845'' (1961)  p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate in Congress==
Supporters of the bill insisted on the project's national significance. This particular project was intended to be a part of a much larger interstate system extending from [[Zanesville, Ohio]], to [[Florence, Alabama]]. If the highway as a whole was of national significance, they argued, surely the individual sections must be as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 433-435 (Sen. Tyler). p. 831-833 (Rep. Polk).&lt;/ref&gt; They looked to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision handed down six years before in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', in which the court confirmed the power to regulate commerce among the states including those portions of the journey which lay within one state or another. Additionally, the road connected the interior of Kentucky to the Ohio River, and therefore served as the main artery for the transportation of goods. Kentucky Representative [[Robert Letcher]] made this argument regarding the road's connection to the rest of the nation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road designed to be improved is intended to intersect at the great national road in the State of Ohio. It connects itself also on each side with the Ohio River. These two connections most certainly and justly entitle it to the appellation of a national work.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.''  p. 820 (Rep. Letcher)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, the federal government had provided funding for other intrastate projects when they benefited the rest of the nation. As Representative Coleman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But gentlemen say, every inch of the Maysville road is in the State of Kentucky. How can it be national? I answer, every inch of the Delaware Canal, sixteen miles in length, is in the State of [[New Jersey]]; and every inch of the Louisville Canal is in one county; nay, I believe in one city. How can they be national? Yet, Congress have subscribed for stock in both of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 828 (Rep. Coleman)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arguments were all intended to illustrate the road's overwhelming national significance. Opponents responded that this line of argument would establish that every road was a national road; there would be no limit to federal power.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 831 (Rep. Polk)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jackson's veto==
Jackson believed that federal money should only be spent when carrying out Congress' enumerated powers. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] employed a broad view of the spending power when he carried out the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the construction of the Cumberland Road. In contrast, President [[James Madison]], the "Father of the Constitution”, viewed this type of spending as unconstitutional, as evidenced by his veto of the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]]. Jackson sided with Madison's view and felt that Jefferson's broad view of the spending power was not enough to justify passage of the bill before him.
One of Jackson's main arguments against the bill was the project's provincial nature. It was understood that Congress could only fund projects which benefited the nation as a whole, but the Maysville project was "purely local matter:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has no connection with any established system of improvements; is exclusively within the limits of a State, starting at a point on the Ohio River and running out 60 miles to an interior town, and even as far as the State is interested conferring partial instead of general advantages.{{citation needed}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson was quick to clarify that this did not imply that he would approve of projects which were of "national" character. Even though there is not a constitutional argument to be made against this type of action, it would be unwise to do so at the time, given the public debt. Until the debt was paid off, there would be no surplus to spend on these projects.

Generally, Jackson supported internal improvements. During his first term, he sanctioned federal expenditures for transportation projects at a rate nearly double that of the expenditures under President [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Deusen p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as good policy to spend federal money on national improvements, as long as two conditions were met. First, they should be done pursuant to a general system of improvement, not by ad hoc legislation. Second, the Constitution should be amended to make clear the limits on federal power.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Currie, ''The Constitution in Congress: Democrats and Whigs, 1829-1861'' (U of Chicago Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that Jackson's veto can be seen as largely driven by personal, rather than political motives, particularly given Jackson's approval of internal improvement bills with as much a local nature as the Maysville Road. Jackson's veto may have been one of the many manifestations of the rivalry between Jackson and Henry Clay, who was one of the major proponents of the Maysville Road as part of his [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

Because the Maysville Road Project was of a local nature, the veto did not encounter resounding opposition in Congress. In fact, the veto would please voters in New York and Pennsylvania who were responsible for financing their own projects, and saw no reason to help fund similar projects in other states. It also appealed to Southern [[states' rights]] supporters who had no need for canals or new roads. For Jackson, this decision underscored his belief that the construction of roads and canals lay more within the realm of the states rather than the federal government. This belief in limiting the federal government's scope of action was to be one of the tenets of [[Jacksonian democracy]].

In 1846 President [[James K. Polk]], an admirer and follower of Jackson, vetoed the [[Rivers and Harbors Bill]] on similar grounds. [[Henry Clay]] and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], in contrast to Jackson, supported both the 1830 and 1846 bills because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), 232–37&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Route 68==
While Henry Clay and the Whig Party lost the argument, the two positions represented by the Maysville Road veto continued to face each other into the future. A route that closely approximated the surveyed right-of-way for the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike received substantial federal aid in the 20th century and would be designated as part of [[U.S. Route 68]]. This aid and designation represented a reversal of the principles set forth by Jackson in his 1830 veto.

'''Meritocracy''' (''merit'', from [[Latin]] ''mereō'', and ''-cracy'', from [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος ''{{transl|el|kratos}}'' "strength, power") is a [[political philosophy]] which holds that certain things, such as [[Goods|economic goods]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], should be [[vested]] in [[individual]]s on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as sexuality, race, gender, or wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of merit|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meritocracy?s=t|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was first created in 1958 by the sociologist [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]].&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary shows the first use in 1956 and gives this citation. "1956 A. Fox in Socialist Comm. May 13/1 The ‘meritocracy’; the society in which the gifted, the smart, the energetic, the ambitious and the ruthless are carefully sifted out and helped towards their destined positions of dominance."  Young's entry is listed as "1958 M. Young Rise of Meritocracy iv. 71 Before the meritocracy was fully established, age-stratification as a substitute for the hereditary order may have been necessary for the sake of social stability."

==Definitions==
===Early definitions===
The "most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by [[IQ]] or standardized achievement tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=Alan R.|title=Education and Sociology: An Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436|quote=most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms tested competency and power, and most likely as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; In government and other administrative systems, "meritocracy" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on "merits", like performance, intelligence, [[credential]]s, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt;

In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]" and "[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meritocracy|title=Definition of Meritocracy|work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to the original, condemnatory use of the term in 1958 by Michael Young in his work "''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''", who was satirizing the ostensibly merit-based [[Tripartite System]] of education practiced in the United Kingdom at the time; he claimed that, in the Tripartite System, "merit is equated with intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education, and there is an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought|year=1988|publisher=Fontana Press|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in its wider sense, may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits; such acts frequently are described in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation. Thus, the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical [[wikt:talent#Noun|talent]] or to [[work ethic]]. As such meritocracy may be based on [[soft skills|character]] or [[intelligence|innate abilities]]. Meritocrats therefore reject evaluation on the basis of race, wealth, family circumstances, and similar criteria.

In [[rhetoric]], the demonstration of one's merit regarding mastery of a particular subject is an essential task most directly related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] term ''[[Ethos]]''. The equivalent Aristotelian conception of meritocracy is based upon [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] structures, rather than in the context of the modern [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Pol. 2.1261b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, (351 BC) ''Politics''. Book Three Part IV. (Jowett, B., Trans)&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent definitions===

In the United States, the assassination of President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881 prompted the replacement of the American [[Spoils System]] with a meritocracy. In 1883, The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed, stipulating government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;

The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree. Higher education is an imperfect meritocratic screening system for various reasons, such as lack of uniform standards worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;What's College For?: The Struggle To Define American Higher Education; Zachary Karabell; {{ISBN|978-0-465-09152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning – May 2008 Volume 5, Number 5 AACSB Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt; lack of scope (not all occupations and processes are included), and lack of access (some talented people never have an opportunity to participate because of the expense, most especially in [[developing country|developing countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Higher education and social justice |author1=Furlong, Andy|author2=Cartmel, Fred|isbn=978-0-335-22362-6|publisher=Open University Press|location =Maidenhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, academic degrees serve some amount of meritocratic screening purpose in the absence of a more refined methodology. Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.

==Etymology==
Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term "meritocracy" is relatively new. It was used pejoratively by [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in his 1958 [[satire|satirical]] [[essay]]&lt;ref name="riseofmeri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Young (politician)|title=The rise of the meritocracy, 1870-2033: An essay on education and inequality|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London| oclc=3943639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it|last=Young|first=Michael|date=29 June 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ford, Boris|year=1992|title=The Cambridge cultural history of Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-42889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamolnick, Paul|year=2005|title=The just meritocracy: IQ, class mobility, and American social policy|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|page=87|isbn=978-0-275-97922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Best, Shaun|year=2005|title=Understanding Social Divisions|publisher=Sage|page=32|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-4296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]'', which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else, being the combination of the root of Latin origin "merit" (from "mereō" meaning "earn") and the Ancient Greek suffix "-cracy" (meaning "power", "rule").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meritocracy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|accessdate=3 July 2013|title="meritocracy" in the Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''purely'' Greek word is axiocracy (αξιοκρατία), from axios (αξιος, worthy) + "-cracy" (-κρατία, power).)
In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.
The essay, written in the first person by a fictional historical narrator in 2034, interweaves history from the politics of pre- and post-war Britain with those of fictional future events in the short (1960 onward) and long term (2020 onward).&lt;ref name="young_p11"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was based upon the tendency of the then-current governments, in their striving toward intelligence, to ignore shortcomings and upon the failure of education systems to utilize correctly the gifted and talented members within their societies.&lt;ref name="young_p13"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's fictional narrator explains that, on the one hand, the greatest contributor to society is not the "stolid mass" or majority, but the "creative minority" or members of the "restless elite".&lt;ref name="young_p15"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he claims that there are casualties of progress whose influence is underestimated and that, from such stolid adherence to natural science and intelligence, arises arrogance and complacency.&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt; This problem is encapsulated in the phrase "Every selection of one is a rejection of many".&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt;

It was also used by [[Hannah Arendt]] in her essay "Crisis in Education",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf "Crisis in Education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030134/http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf |date=14 October 2013 }} (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; which was written in 1958 and refers to the use of meritocracy in the English educational system.  She too uses the term pejoratively.  It was not until 1972 that [[Daniel Bell]] used the term positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littler|first1=Jo|title=Meritocracy: the great delusion that ingrains inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times: China===
{{further information|Chinese Legalism}}
According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Chung|first2=Yinzheng|last2=Geng|title=

This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sienkewicz|first=Thomas J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient World:|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press|page=434|quote=Confucius invented the notion that those who govern should so because of merit and not inherited status, setting in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

According to the [[Princeton University|Princeton Encyclopedia on American History]]:&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China. Tracing back to 200 B.C., the Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism as the basis of its political philosophy and structure, which included the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with one of virtue and honesty, and thereby calling for administrative appointments to be based solely on merit. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position that would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. In part due to Chinese influence, the first European civil service did not originate in Europe, but rather in India by the British-run East India Company... company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism.}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] advocated meritocracy, Plato in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', arguing that the wisest should rule, and hence the rulers should be [[philosopher king]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Estlund (2003) for a summary and discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: spread to Europe===
The concept of meritocracy spread from China to British India during the seventeenth century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; With the translation of Confucian texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancient regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The first European power to implement a successful meritocratic civil service was the [[British Empire]], in their administration of India: "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; British colonial administrators advocated the spread of the system to the rest of the commonwealth, the most "persistent" of which was Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. Meadows successfully argued in his ''[[Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China]]'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde,|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later was adopted in the late nineteenth century by the British mainland, inspired by the "Chinese mandarin system".&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Huddleston, Mark W. Boyer, William W.''The higher civil service in the United States: quest for reform''. (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated meritocracy in his book, ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]''. His model was to give more votes to the more [[Education|educated]] voter. His views are explained in Estlund (2003:57–58):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Mill's proposal of plural voting has two motives. One is to prevent one group or class of people from being able to control the political process even without having to give reasons in order to gain sufficient support. He calls this the problem of class legislation. Since the most numerous class is also at a lower level of education and social rank, this could be partly remedied by giving those at the higher ranks plural votes. A second, and equally prominent motive for plural voting is to avoid giving equal influence to each person without regard to their merit, intelligence, etc. He thinks that it is fundamentally important that political institutions embody, in their spirit, the recognition that some opinions are worth more than others. He does not say that this is a route to producing better political decisions, but it is hard to understand his argument, based on this second motive, in any other way.

So, if Aristotle is right that the deliberation is best if participants are numerous (and assuming for simplicity that the voters are the deliberators) then this is a reason for giving all or many citizens a vote, but this does not yet show that the wiser subset should not have, say, two or three; in that way something would be given both to the value of the diverse perspectives, and to the value of the greater wisdom of the few. This combination of the Platonic and Aristotelian points is part of what I think is so formidable about Mill's proposal of plural voting. It is also an advantage of his view that he proposes to privilege not the wise, but the educated. Even if we agreed that the wise should rule, there is a serious problem about how to identify them. This becomes especially important if a successful political justification must be generally acceptable to the ruled. In that case, privileging the wise would require not only their being so wise as to be better rulers, but also, and more demandingly, that their wisdom be something that can be agreed to by all reasonable citizens. I turn to this conception of justification below.

Mill's position has great plausibility: good education promotes the ability of citizens to rule more wisely. So, how can we deny that the educated subset would rule more wisely than others. But then why shouldn't they have more votes?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estlund goes on to criticize Mill's education-based meritocracy on various grounds.

===19th century===
In the United States, the federal bureaucracy used the [[Spoils System]] from 1828 until the assassination of United States President [[James A. Garfield]] by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. Two years later in 1883, the system of appointments to the United States Federal Bureaucracy was revamped by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], partially based on the British meritocratic civil service that had been established years earlier. The act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit, through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3115 |title=Civil Service Reform |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; In the modern American meritocracy, the president may hand out only a certain number of jobs, which must be approved by the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]].

Australia began establishing public universities in the 1850s with the goal of promoting meritocracy by providing advanced training and credentials. The educational system was set up to service urban males of middle-class background, but of diverse social and religious origins. It was increasingly extended to all graduates of the public school system, those of rural and regional background, and then to women and finally to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Horne, and Geoffrey Sherington, "Extending the educational franchise: the social contract of Australia's public universities, 1850-1890,"  ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#1 pp 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the middle classes and the working classes have promoted the ideal of meritocracy within a strong commitment to "mate-ship" and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Henry|title=Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_FSMpdmK3oC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to today===
[[Singapore]] describes meritocracy as one of its official guiding principles for domestic public policy formulation, placing emphasis on academic credentials as objective measures of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html Speech by Singapore Ambassador to France], 28 August 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193448/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism that, under this system, Singaporean society is being increasingly stratified and that an elite class is being created from a narrow segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|title=Singapore's elites|author=Ngiam Tong Dow|date=28 October 2006|publisher=Little Speck|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101220026/http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|archive-date=1 November 2006|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has a growing level of tutoring for children,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wyomingfreelibrary.org/growing-trend-of-uplifting-education-business-in-singapore/|title=Growing trend of uplifting education business in Singapore|newspaper=Free Library and Tuition|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and top tutors are often paid better than school teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year|title=$1 billion spent on tuition in one year|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.epigami.sg/blog/2015-private-tuition-rates-singapore/|title=2015 Private Tuition Rates in Singapore {{!}} Epigami Blog|date=2015-01-21|newspaper=Epigami Blog|access-date=2016-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants{{Who|date=May 2018}} recall the ancient Chinese proverb "Wealth does not pass three generations" ({{zh|c=富不过三代}}), suggesting that the [[nepotism]] or [[cronyism]] of elitists eventually will be, and often are, replaced by those lower down the hierarchy.

Singaporean academics are continuously re-examining the application of meritocracy as an ideological tool and how it's stretched to encompass the ruling party's objectives. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that  "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=January 2008|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=29|issue=7-27|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in the Singaporean context relates to the application of pragmatism as an ideological device which combines strict adherence to market principles ''without'' any aversion to social engineering and little propensity for classical social welfarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/|title=Opinion {{!}} How Singapore is fixing its meritocracy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is further illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan in subsequent articles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a strong ideological quality in Singapore's pragmatism, and a strongly pragmatic quality in ideological negotiations within the dynamics of hegemony. In this complex relationship, the combination of ideological and pragmatic maneuvering over the decades has resulted in the historical dominance of government by the PAP in partnership with global capital whose interests have been advanced without much reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=9 Dec 2011|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Within the [[Ecuador]]ian Ministry of Labor, the Ecuadorian Meritocracy Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014509/http://www.meritocracia.gob.ec/ Web page of "Instituto Nacional de Meritocracia de Ecuador"] , 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was created under the technical advice of the [[Singapore]]an government.

Most contemporary political theorists, including [[John Rawls]], reject the ideal of meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Justice|last=Rawls|first=John|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, Thomas Mulligan has defended meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Meritocratic State|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|date=|title=Plural Voting for the Twenty First Century|url=https://academic.oup.com/pq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pq/pqx046/4157866|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=What's Wrong with Libertarianism: A Meritocratic Diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a just society is one in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged on their merits.

==Modern meritocratic movements==

===The Meritocracy Party===
In 2007 an anonymous British group called The Meritocracy Party published its first manifesto, to which they have now added more than two million words on the subject (discussing [[Hegel]], [[Rousseau]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], and various other philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries). In summary, The Meritocracy Party wants to achieve the following:

# A world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life.
# The abolishment of party politics.
# Only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote, rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21.
# The introduction of 100% inheritance tax, so that the super-rich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few (their privileged children). This would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy.
# A radically reformed educational system, based on the [[MBTI]] personality types, and insights from radical innovators such as [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Maria Montessori]].
# To replace [[free market capitalism]] with [[social capitalism]] and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic, under a meritocratic constitution.
# The end of [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], discrimination, privilege and unequal chances.

On their website The Meritocracy Party lists five meritocratic principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=ug4xDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=meritocracy+party+uk+principles+and+goals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqxj2wdXhH&amp;sig=g7sp7-a428BizCKj3GroxrLX4LQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0KaV4KTWAhVF3IMKHQ9lBhMQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=meritocracy%20party%20uk%20principles%20and%20goals&amp;f=false|title=The Citizen Army|last=Spartacus|first=Brother|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|year=|isbn=9781326642167|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen primary aims. The Meritocracy International is the host of all meritocratic political parties in the world and the place where these may be found by country of origin.&lt;ref name="keran"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Just-world hypothesis}}
The term "meritocracy" was originally intended as a negative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Michael Young, 86, Scholar; Coined, Mocked 'Meritocracy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/michael-young-86-scholar-coined-mocked-meritocracy.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary concerns with meritocracy is the unclear definition of "merit".&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Bowles and Durlauf. ''Meritocracy and Economic Inequality''. Princeton, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered as meritorious can differ with opinions as on which qualities are considered the most worthy, raising the question of which "merit" is the highest—or, in other words, which standard is the "best" standard. As the supposed effectiveness of a meritocracy is based on the supposed competence of its officials, this standard of merit cannot be arbitrary and has to also reflect the competencies required for their roles.

The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. [[Standardized test]]ing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]], commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

The level of education required in order to become competitive in a meritocracy may also be costly, effectively limiting candidacy for a position of power to those with the means necessary to become educated. An example of this was Chinese student self-declared messiah, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who despite ranking first in a preliminary, nationwide [[imperial examination]], was unable to afford further education. As such, although he did try to study in private, Hong was ultimately noncompetitive in later examinations and unable to become a bureaucrat. This economic aspect of meritocracies has been said to continue nowadays in countries without free educations, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, consisting only of justices who attended [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]] and generally only considering clerkship candidates who attended a top-five university, while in the 1950s the two universities only accounted for around one fifth of the justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death by Degrees|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-14/the-intellectual-situation/death-by-degrees/|website=[[n+1]]|publisher=n+1 Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if free education were provided, the resources that the parents of a student are able to provide outside of the curriculum, such as tutoring, exam preparation, and financial support for living costs during higher education will influence the education the student attains and the student's social position in a meritocratic society. This limits the fairness and justness of any meritocratic system.

Another concern regards the principle of incompetence, or the "[[Peter Principle]]". As people rise in a meritocratic society through the social hierarchy through their demonstrated merit, they eventually reach, and become stuck, at a level too difficult for them to perform effectively; they are promoted to incompetence. This reduces the effectiveness of a meritocratic system, the supposed main practical benefit of which is the competence of those who run the society.

In his book ''Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness'' (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]] argued that educational meritocracy is nothing but a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] version of social Darwinism. Its proponents argue that the theory justifies [[social inequality]] as being meritocratic. This [[social theory]] holds that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human [[social institution]]s—the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as [[normative]]. Social Darwinism shares its roots with early [[progressivism]], and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of [[World War II]]. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model normatively to unequal endowments of human ambitions.

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fna|This is the history of the meritocracy in the technical sense. The vaguer definition of a meritocracy as a "rule by intelligence" has been applied to many ancient Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Jewish thinkers and statesmen. For example, the Sanhedrin, the legislature of [[Ancient Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]], is sometimes called as an "intellectual meritocracy", in the sense that its members were drawn from religious scribes and not the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elazar|first=Daniel Judah|title=The Jewish polity: Jewish political organization from Biblical times to the present|year=1985|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GntDdBeIOqwC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=6MByAfweKr&amp;dq=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment was self-perpetuating, however, and new members were chosen personally by existing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=David|title=The Jewish social contract: an essay in political theology|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=134|quote=The Sanhedrin were appointed by those who were members when there was a vacancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not meritocracies in the administrative sense, in which merit is determined objectively as a "tested competency or ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=lan R. |title=Education and sociology: an encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the end of the 20th century, [[propaganda]] has evolved significantly. Today's propaganda is characterised by [[psych-op]]s and [[disinformation]], whereas a few decades ago it was dominated by posters and simple films.


==Middle East==

===Afghan War===

In the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], [[psychological operations]] tactics were employed to [[demoralization (military)|demoralise]] the [[Taliban]] and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six [[EC-130E|EC-130E Commando Solo]] aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. [[Pamphlets|Leaflets]] were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for [[Osama bin Laden]] and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of [[Mohammed Omar]] in a set of crosshairs with the words: "We are watching."

===Iraq War===

Both the [[United States]] and [[Iraq]] employed propaganda during the [[Iraq War]]. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Altheide, David L 2009"&gt;Altheide, David L. "War and Mass Mediated Evidence." Cultural Studies&amp;nbsp;— Critical Methodologies 9 (2009): 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi propaganda====

The Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 23–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Vietcong]]'s tactics,&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"&gt;Schleifer, Ron. "Reconstructing Iraq: Winning the Propaganda War in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly (2005): 15–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]] were using rapid movement to keep the [[coalition]] off-balance.&lt;ref name="Garfield, Andrew 2007"/&gt; By using low-technology strategies to convey their messages, they were able to gain support.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 24&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti slogans were used on walls and houses praising the virtues of many group leaders while condemning the Iraqi government. Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the [[U.S. Government|US Government]] were trying to influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Garfield, Andrew. "The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq." Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 26&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In addition, a domestic [[Arabic language]] television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt;

====US propaganda in Iraq====
[[File:your future al-Zarqawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States of America|US]] [[Psychological operations|PSYOP]] [[pamphlet]] disseminated in [[Iraq]]. The pamphlet says: "This is your future, Al-Zarqawi", and shows [[Al-Qaeda]] fighter [[Al-Zarqawi]] caught in a rat trap.]]
To achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between "good" and "bad" Islam has proved challenging for the US.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt;

The US implemented [[Black Propaganda|black propaganda]] by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro-American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was ''Radio Tikrit''.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup"&gt;Shah, Anup. Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda. Aug 1, 2007. May 12, 2009. &lt;http://www.globalissues.org/article/461/media-reporting-journalism-and-propaganda.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that it was the [[Lincoln Group]] who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ShahAnup" /&gt;

The US was more successful with the ''[[Voice of America]]'' campaign, which is an old [[Cold War]] tactic that exploited people's desire for information.&lt;ref name="Schleifer, Ron 2005"/&gt; While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful,{{fact|date=February 2016}} they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, Sol 2008"&gt;Goldstein, Sol. "A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq." Military Review 88.2 (Mar. 2008): 58–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' alleged that the [[United States military]] had [[media manipulation|manipulated news]] reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the [[insurgency]]. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is "an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents", while a spokesman for former [[Defense Secretary]] [[Donald H. Rumsfeld]] said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] confirmed the existence of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = U.S. Military Unclear on 'Planted' Stories | agency = Associated Press | date = November 30, 2005 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/11/30/national/w140545S58.DTL | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630204816/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2005%2F11%2F30%2Fnational%2Fw140545S58.DTL | archivedate = June 30, 2006 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Baldor | first = Lolita C. | title = Pentagon describes Iraq propaganda plan | agency = Associated Press | date = December 2, 2005 | url = http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051205031408/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13305355.htm |archivedate = December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda aimed at US citizens====
The extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book ''Selling Intervention &amp; War,'' by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was "selling the war" to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Thrall, A. Trevor. "A Review of: "Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq, by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber Weapons of Mass Persuasion: Marketing the War Against Iraq, by Paul Rutherford Selling Intervention &amp; War: The Presidency, the..." Political Communication 24.2 (Apr. 2007): 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

President George W. Bush gave a talk at the Athena Performing Arts Centre, at Greece Athena Middle and High School, Tuesday, May 24, 2005, in Rochester, New York. About halfway through the event, Bush said: "See, in my line of work, you got to keep repeating things over and over, and over again, for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda."

People had their initial reactions to the War on Terror.  While the United States' official stance was to remove Saddam Hussein's power in Iraq with allegations that his government held weapons of mass destruction or was related to [[Osama Bin Laden]],&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas 2004"&gt;O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas. "Weapons of Mass Seduction: Propaganda, Media and the Iraq War." Journal of Political Marketing 3.4 (2004): 79–104. America: History &amp; Life.&lt;/ref&gt; over time the Iraq war as a whole has been seen in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;John, Sue Lockett, et al. "Going Public, Crisis after Crisis: The Bush Administration and the Press from September 11 to Saddam." Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 10.2 (Summer2007 2007): 195–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Video and picture coverage in the news has shown images of [[torture]] and other PR disasters being done under the [[Iraqi Government]].&lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy, Nicholas 2004"/&gt;

==North Korea==
{{Main|Propaganda in North Korea}}
[[File:NKmuseum.jpg|thumb|North Koreans touring the [[Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities|Museum of American War Atrocities]].]]
Every year, a state-owned publishing house{{which|date=July 2014}} releases several cartoons (called ''[[geurim-chaek]]'' in [[North Korea]]), many of which are smuggled across the [[China–North Korea border|Chinese border]] and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the ''[[Juche]]'' philosophy of [[Kim Il-sung]] (the "father" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters.

DPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word "THIEF" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentaryaddict.com/Nuclear+Nightmare+Understanding+North+Korea-10151-doc.html Nuclear Nightmare: Understanding North Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican drug cartels==

Drug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and [[narcomanta|''narcomantas'']] to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word ''narco'', and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded ''narco''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shared values initiative]] was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a "new" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America.&lt;ref name="Rampton"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Shared Values Revisited|journal=Center for Media and Democracy|date=October 17, 2007|first=Sheldon|last=Rampton|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=http://www.prwatch.org/node/6465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by the [[United States Department of State]], the campaign created a public relations front group known as Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Reaches Out to Muslim World with Shared Values Initiative|journal=America.gov|date=January 16, 2003|first=|last=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id=|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2003/January/20030116185938skaufman@pd.state.gov0.3441126.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018222857/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2003/January/20030116185938skaufman%40pd.state.gov0.3441126.html|archivedate=October 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

(2003), ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, p. 1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government.&lt;ref name=mitter /&gt; China in the era of [[Mao Zedong]] is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and [[Literacy|illiterate]] population.&lt;ref name=mitter /&gt; In poor developing countries, China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening [[Confucius Institute]]s, and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|author2=Perry Link |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124319304482150525| year=2009|title=China's Modern Authoritarianism|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|pacifism}}
'''Pacificism''' is the general term for [[ethical]] opposition to [[violence]] or [[war]], except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of [[peace]].

It falls between [[pacifism]], which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and [[defensivism]], which accepts all ''defensive'' wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629055802/http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm "last resort", condemning both [[aggression]] and [[militarism]]. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinct theory was first put forward by [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in ''The Trouble-Makers'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;‘By ‘pacificism’ I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‘pacifism’ (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.’  AJP Taylor, ''The Trouble-Makers'', London: H Hamilton, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, ''Thinking About Peace and War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pacifism.htm#SH2c Pacifism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/peaceed/pe_debate.html Pledge Peace Union - Debating Peace and War]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also discussed in detail in [[Richard Norman]]'s book: ''Ethics, Killing and War''.

The largest national peace association in history, the British [[League of Nations Union]], was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Birn, ''The League of Nations Union'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the majority of peace activists have been pacificists rather than strict pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi Detached Idealists: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan-Slavism''', a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the [[political ideology]] concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the [[Slavic people|Slavic-speaking people]]s. Its main impact occurred in the [[Balkans]], where non-Slavic empires had ruled the [[South Slav]]s for centuries. These were mainly the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (both as separate entities for most of the period), the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

== Origins ==
Extensive pan-Slavism began much like [[Pan-Germanism]], both of which grew from the sense of unity and [[nationalism]] experienced within [[ethnic group]]s after the [[French Revolution]] and the consequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] against European monarchies. Like other [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of [[history]], [[philology]], and [[folklore]] actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the [[South Slavs|Southern Slavic]] independence.

Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] (blue, white and red) and the Pan-Slavic anthem, ''[[Hey, Slavs]]''.

The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer [[Vinko Pribojević]] and the 17th-century [[Aleksandar Komulović]], [[Bartol Kašić]], [[Ivan Gundulić]] and [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionary [[Juraj Križanić]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Letiche and Basil Dmytryshyn: "Russian Statecraft: The Politika of Iurii Krizhanich", Oxford and New York, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivo Banac]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA71 "The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics"], Cornell University Press, 1988, pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBtVAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies|page=162|quote=... the work of some early "Panslavic" ideologues in the sixteenth (Pribojevic) and seventeenth (Gundulic, Komulovic, Kasic,...)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest manifestations of Pan-Slavic thought within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] have been attributed to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] and [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Weston Evans, Chapter "Nationality in East-Central Europe: Perception and Definition before 1848." ''Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburgs: Essays on Central Europe, c.1683-1867.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In the aftermath, the leaders of Europe sought to restore the pre-war [[status quo]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], Austria's representative, [[Metternich|Prince von Metternich]], felt the threat to this status quo in Austria was the nationalists demanding independence from the empire. While their subjects were composed of numerous ethnic groups (such as [[Italians]], [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]], etc.), most of the subjects were Slavs.

== First Pan-Slav Congress, Prague, 1848 ==
The [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|First Pan-Slav congress]] was held in [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]] in June, 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]]. The Czechs had refused to send representatives to the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The [[Austroslavism|Austroslav]], [[František Palacký]], presided over the event. Most of the delegates were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the [[Habsburg]]s and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect the peoples of [[central Europe]]. When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of [[Europe]], in the interest of [[All humanity|humanity]] itself, to create it.”

The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of [[Field Marshal]] [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]], the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established [[martial law]] throughout Bohemia.

== Pan-Slavism in Czech lands and Slovakia ==

[[File:Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|right|Slavic flag proposed by the Pan-Slav convention&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Вилинбахов Г. В.'' [http://www.dissercat.com/content/gosudarstvennaya-geraldika-v-rossii-teoriya-i-praktika Государственная геральдика в России: Теория и практика] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]] in 1848]]

The first Pan-Slavic convention was held in Prague on June 2 through 16, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  The delegates at the Congress were specifically both [[Austria-hungary#Ethnic relations|anti-Austrian]] and [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|anti-Russian]]. Still "the Right"—the moderately liberal wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[František Palacký]] (1798–1876), a Czech historian and politician,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note on page 784 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861), a Slovak philologist, historian and archaeologist,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note at page 787 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''&lt;/ref&gt; favored autonomy of the Slav lands within the framework of Austrian (Habsburg) monarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast "the Left"—the radical wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[Karel Sabina]] (1813–1877), a Czech writer and journalist, [[Josef Václav Frič]], a Czech nationalist, [[Karol Libelt]] (1817–1861), a Polish writer and politician, and others, pressed for a close alliance with the revolutionary-democratic movement going on in Germany and Hungary in 1848.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A national rebirth in the Hungarian "Upper Land" (now [[Slovakia]]) awoken in a completely new light, both before the Slovak Uprising in 1848 and after. The driving force of this rebirth movement were Slovak writers and politicians who called themselves Štúrovci, the followers of [[Ľudovít Štúr]]. As the Slovak nobility was [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] and most of Slovaks were merely farmers or priests, this movement failed to attract much attention. Nonetheless, the campaign was successful as a brotherly cooperation between the Croats and the Slovaks brought its fruit throughout the war. Most of the battles between Slovaks and Hungarians however, did not turn out in favor for the Slovaks who were logistically supported by the Austrians, but not sufficiently. The shortage of manpower proved to be decisive as well.

During the war, the [[Slovak National Council]] brought its demands to the young Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], who seemed to take a note of it and promised support for the Slovaks against the revolutionary radical Hungarians. However the moment the revolution was over, Slovak demands were forgotten. These demands included an autonomous land within the Austrian Empire called "Slovenský kraj" which would be eventually led by a Serbian prince. This act of ignorance from the Emperor convinced the Slovak and the Czech elite who proclaimed the concept of Austroslavism as dead. 

Disgusted by the Emperor's policy, in the year of 1849, Ľudovít Štúr, the person who codified the first official [[Slovak language]], wrote a book he would name ''Slavdom and the World of the Future''. This book served him as a manifesto where he noted that Austroslavism was not the way to go anymore. He also wrote a sentence that often serves as a quote until this day: "Every nation has its time under God's sun, and the [[tilia|linden]] [a symbol of the Slavs] is blossoming, while the [[Oak#National_symbol|oak]] [a symbol of the Teutons] bloomed long ago."&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-sk|Každý národ má svoj čas pod Božím slnkom, a lipa kvitne až dub už dávno odkvitol.}}) {{Cite book|title=Slovanstvo a svet budúcnosti. Bratislava 1993, s. 59|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He expressed confidence in the [[Russian Empire]] however, as it was the only country of Slavs that was not dominated by anybody else, yet it was one of the most powerful nations in the world. He often symbolized Slavs as being a tree, with "minor" Slavic nations being branches while the trunk of the tree was Russian. His Pan-Slavic views were unleashed in this book, where he stated that the land of Slovaks should be annexed by the Tsar's empire and that eventually the population could be not only [[Russification|Russified]], but also converted into the rite of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]], religion originally spread by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] during the times of [[Great Moravia]], which served as an opposition to the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] missionaries from the [[Franks]]. After the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian invasion of Pannonia]], Hungarians converted into Catholicism, which effectively influenced the Slavs living in [[Pannonia]] and in the land south of the Lechs.

However, the Russian Empire often claimed Pan-Slavism as a justification for its aggressive moves in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe against the Ottoman Empire, which conquered and held the land of Slavs for centuries. This eventually led to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Balkan campaign]] of the Russian Empire, which resulted in the entire Balkan being liberated from the Ottoman Empire, with the help and the initiative of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Germany and Pan-Slavism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'', pp. 156-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-Slavism has some supporters among Czech and Slovak politicians, especially among the nationalistic and far-right ones, such as People's Party - Our Slovakia.

During [[World War I]], captured Slavic soldiers were asked to fight against "oppression in the Austrian Empire". Consequently, some did. (see [[Czechoslovak Legions]])

The creation of an independent [[Czechoslovakia]] made the old ideals of Pan-Slavism anachronistic. Relations with other Slavic states varied, sometimes being so tense it escalated into an armed conflict, such as with the [[Second Polish Republic]] where border clashes over [[Silesia]] resulted in a short hostile conflict, the [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]]. Even tensions between Czechs and Slovaks had appeared before and during the World War II.

The capital city of Slovakia is [[Bratislava]], a name that is a conjunction of the word Brother (Brat) and Glory (Slava), a name which is generally considered as a symbol of Slavic identity, brotherhood and values.

== Pan-Slavism among South Slavs ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
{{main article|Yugoslavism}}
Pan-Slavism in the south would often turn to Russia for support. The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Some Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ([[Croats]], [[Slovenes]]), [[Islam|Muslim]] ([[Bosniaks]]), or [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] ([[Serbs]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Bulgarians]]) as a "Southern-Slavic nation of three faiths".

Austria feared that Pan-Slavists would endanger the empire. In Austria-Hungary Southern Slavs were distributed among several entities: [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian part ([[Carniola]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] (also [[Croats]])), Croats and [[Serbs]] in the Hungarian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and in the Austrian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], and in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], under direct control from Vienna. Due to a different position within Austria-Hungary several different goals were prominent among the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary. A strong alternative to Pan-Slavism was [[Austroslavism]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Citation

Because the Serbs were dispersed among several regions, and the fact that they had ties to the independent [[Nation-state|nation state]] of [[Kingdom of Serbia]], they were among the strongest supporters of independence of South-Slavs from Austria-Hungary and uniting into a common state under Serbian monarchy.

In 1863, the [[Association of Serbian Philology]] commemorated the death of [[Cyril]] a thousand years earlier, its president [[Dimitrije Matić]], talked of the creation of an ethnically "pure" Slavonic people: "with God’s help, there should be a whole Slavonic people with purely Slavonic faces and of purely Slavonic character"&lt;ref&gt;Association of Serbian Philology: Hiljadugodišnja 1863:4&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], under Serbian royalty of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]], united most Southern [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] regardless of religion and cultural background. The only ones they did not unite with were the Bulgarians. Still, in the years after the [[Second World War]], there were proposals to incorporate Bulgaria into a [[Greater Yugoslavia]] thus uniting all south [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] into one state.&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, Sabrina P.; ''The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918-2005''; [[Indiana University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-253-34656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was abandoned after the split between [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1948. This led to some bitter sentiment between the people of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the aftermath.

At the end of Second World War, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], a Croat, became Yugoslav president, and the country become a socialist republic. Tito advocated [[Brotherhood and unity]] which meant equality among the ethnic groups, including non-Slav minorities. This led to relatively peaceful co-existence and prosperity until the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation]].

== Pan-Slavism in Poland ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2017}}
Although early Pan-Slavism had found support among some Poles, it soon lost its appeal as the movement became dominated by [[Russia]]. While Russian Pan-Slavists spoke of liberation of other Slavs through Russian actions, parts of [[Poland]] had been ruled by the [[Russian Empire]] since the [[Partitions of Poland]]. At different points in history, Poland often saw itself in partnership with non-Slavic nations, such as [[Hungary-Poland relations|Hungary]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Polish–Swedish union|Sweden]] and [[Lithuania]] under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Especially after 1795, [[First French Republic|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France was held in high regard by most Poles, and seen as the main champion of [[Duchy of Warsaw|reconstitution of their country]], particularly since it was a mutual enemy of Austria, Prussia and Russia. The influence of 19th century Pan-Slavism had little impact in Poland except for creating sympathy towards the other oppressed Slavic nations and their aspirations to independence. At the same time while Pan-Slavism worked against Austro-Hungary with South Slavs, Poles enjoyed a wide autonomy within the state and assumed a loyalist position towards the Hapsburgs. Within the Austro-Hungarian polity, they were able to develop their national culture and preserve [[Polish language]], both of which were under threat in both [[Germany|German]] and [[Russia]]n Empires. A Pan-Slavic federation was proposed, but on the condition that the [[Russian Empire]] would be excluded from such an entity. After Poland regained its independence (from Germany, Austria and Russia) in 1918 no major force considered Pan-Slavism as a serious alternative, viewing Pan-Slavism as little more than a code word for [[Russification]]. During Poland's communist era, the [[USSR]] used Pan-Slavism as propaganda tool to justify its control over the country. The issue of the Pan-Slavism was not part of current mainstream politics, and is widely seen as an ideology of Russian [[imperialism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Joseph Conrad]] in Notes on Life and Letters.:
&lt;br/&gt;''"... between Polonism and Slavonism there is not so much hatred as a complete and ineradicable incompatibility."'' ... Conrad argues that "nothing is more foreign than what in the literary world is called Slavonism to his ''individual'' sensibility and ''the whole Polish mentality"''&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Life and Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pan-Slavism in Russia ==

Pan-Slavism is popular in the large [[immigration]] from the former [[USSR]] to Slavic countries of the [[European Union]]. It expresses fierce populism, nostalgia for the Soviet era, and strong anti-Western [[Feeling|sentiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/articles/2015/05/22/slavesobor/ Report about the XII. Pan-slavic congress in Moscow, May 2015 (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13277505/RusV_16-17_15_p.pdf |title=Slavic Unity.

During the time of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik teachings viewed Pan-Slavism as a reactionary element formerly used by the [[Russian Empire]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} As a result, Bolsheviks viewed it as contrary to their Marxist ideology. However, with the emergence of [[World War II]], the Stalinist government saw fit to utilize Pan-Slavic politics, resulting in the Pan-Slavic congress being held in Moscow in 1942.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Modern-day developments ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
The authentic idea of unity of the Slavic people was all but gone after [[World War I]] when the maxim "[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] have put an end to all Slavisms"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN3110106051&amp;id=AsO_M5SaxDgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22west+slavs%22&amp;sig=EmpK-yEW2OHxlLLqb7pZ1GvOOws Comparative Slavic Studies] Volume 6, by [[Roman Jakobson]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was finally put to rest with the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in late 1980s. With the breakup of federal states such as [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] and the problem of Russian and Serbian dominance in any proposed all-Slavic organisation, the idea of Pan-Slavic unity is mostly considered dead in the western world. Varying relations between the Slavic countries exist nowadays; they range from mutual respect on equal footing and sympathy towards one another through traditional dislike and enmity, to indifference. None, other than culture and heritage oriented organizations, are currently considered as a form of rapprochement among the countries with Slavic origins. The political parties which include panslavism as part of their program usually live on the fringe of the political spectrum (e.g. in Poland candidates from Związek Słowiański got no more than few thousands votes). In modern times, the appeals to Pan-Slavism are often made in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="Duleba"&gt;"In other words, the Pan-Slavic resentment is not strange to the Russian Eurasianists, however, this is prevailingly limited to the post-Soviet space. Therein lies the difference between the Eurasians and the Russian radical nationalists in their contemporary attitude to Pan-Slavism. Radical nationalists are the only ones who follow up with the tradition and ideational message of the Central- and South-European Pan-Slavism of the tsarist Russia. Pan-Slavism serves as their tool for demonstrating decisive anti-Western attitudes and as an "historical" folklore employed in domestic-political battles, which sound so sweet to the Russian ear. The ideas of Pan-Slavism only find some echo with the part of some Serbian and partly Slovak nationalists" Alexander Duleba, "From Domination to Partnership - The perspectives of Russian-Central-East European Relations", Final Report to the [[NATO]] Research Fellowship Program, 1996-1998 [http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/96-98/duleba.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of Pan-Slavic languages ==
The similarity of Slavic languages inspired many people to create [[Pan-Slavic language]]s, i.e., [[zonal constructed language]]s for all Slavic people to communicate with one another. Several of these languages were created in the past, but due to the Internet, many more Pan-Slavic languages were created in the [[Digital Age]]. The most popular modern Pan-Slavic language is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

'''Patrimonialism''' is a form of governance in which all power flows directly from the leader. There is no distinction between the public and private domains: “The very essence of patrimonialism consists in the idea that "the whole government authority and the economic rights which correspond to it, tend to be treated as privately appropriated economic advantages"(Medard, 1996).These regimes are [[autocratic]] or [[oligarchic]] and exclude the lower, middle and upper classes from power. The leaders of these countries typically enjoy absolute personal power. Usually, the armies of these countries are loyal to the leader, not the nation.

[[Max weber|Max Weber]] wrote of Patrimonialism as a form of traditional domination. Initially it was centered on family structures, particularly on the authority of fathers within families, in other words [[patriarchy]]. But patriarchy only describes the earlier, smaller form. For Weber, patrimonial monarchies and similar forms of government were projections of patriarchy (the rule of the father within the family) onto a broader set of social relationships.

There are two main forms of patrimonialism in Weber's analysis of traditional authority (domination). One form is characterised by a top-down structure where the emperor or [[sultan]] rules on the basis of his own legitimate authority through traditional bureaucratic officials (e.g. [[Eunuch#Ottoman Empire|eunuchs]]). In principle the Roman Catholic Church is patrimonial in this traditional sense, with the Pope as the Patrimonial Ruler.

The other form of patrimonialism is still top down but it approaches the Ideal Type of Western European Feudalism, with a basis for legitimate authority outside of the central ruler's authority. In 12th century France or England, for example, it could have consisted of the knightly aristocracy. This feudal form of patrimonialism eventually evolved into Constitutional Monarchy. The U.S. Senate is a vestige of the House of Lords in England. The Lords were literally the peers of the realm. Weber's overarching argument was that with modernity, traditional bureaucratic patrimonial forms of government eventually gave way to modern capitalist bureaucratic rationalism as the main principle of both government and governance.

===Nathan Quimpo===
Nathan Quimpo&lt;ref&gt;Political Scientist at the [[University of Tsukuba]]&lt;/ref&gt; defines patrimonialism as "a type of rule in which the ruler does not distinguish between personal and public patrimony and treats matters and resources of state as his personal affair."&lt;ref&gt;Quimpo, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Pipes===
[[Richard Pipes]], a historian and Professor Emeritus of Russian history at Harvard University defines patrimonial as "a regime where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to the point of being indistinguishable, and political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power." &lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the Old Regime, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Julia Adams===
[[Julia Adams (sociologist)|Julia Adams]], a sociologist at [[Yale University]], argues for increased application of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Julia Adams http://aapss.org/the-annals/recent-volumes/2011/08/11/julia-adams-and-liping-wang-bridging-the-gap-between-china-and-europe&lt;/ref&gt;

===J. I. (Hans) Bakker===
[[J. I. (Hans) Bakker]], a sociologist at [[The University of Guelph]], has applied the ideal type to the history of Indonesia in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial days.

===Francis Fukuyama===
[[Francis Fukuyama]], a political scientist at Stanford, describes it as political recruitment based on the two principles of kin selection and reciprocal altruism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fukuyama|first1=Francis|title=The Origins of Political Order|date=2011|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez===
[[Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez]], a Colombian philosopher and former professor at the [[Federal University of Juiz de Fora]] – Brazil, considered one of the foremost academics in Latin American and Iberian Patrimonialism.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Vélez uses the concept of Patrimonialism as established by Max Weber and later expanded by Karl Wittfogel from Columbia University, to explain the political ethos in Latin America. As a renowned specialist in political philosophy, Velez has published numerous books on the subject and is constantly invited as guest speaker in academic forums. Some of his works are: Liberalismo y conservatismo en la América Latina (Bogotá, 1978); Estado, Cultura y Sociedad en la América Latina (Bogotá, 2000);  Patrimonialismo e a Realidade Latino-Americana (Rio de Janeiro, 2006); A Análise do Patrimonialismo através da Literatura Latino-Americana (Rio de Janeiro, 2008).

== Examples ==

Richard Pipes cited the Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] and the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalids]] of [[Pergamon]] as early Patrimonial monarchies, both successor states to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes argues that the Russian Empire between the twelfth and seventeenth century, and with certain modifications until 1917,was a patrimonial system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Bodin]] described seigneurial monarchies in the ''Six books of the Commonwealth'' 1576-86 where the monarch owns all the land. He claimed that Turkey and Muscovy were the only European examples.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; He believed they came about through conquest and were common in Africa and Asia.

Modern and Contemporary Hungarian academics support the postulate that in the [[Middle Ages]] the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] existed as a '''Patrimonial Kingdom''' (in [[Hungarian Language]]: ''Patrimoniális királyság'') where the King was the supreme owner of the Kingdom's lands. 
[[Indonesia]], before and during the [[Suharto administration]], is often cited as being patrimonial in its political-economy.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Adam. 2004. ''A Nation in Waiting.''

In the United States, a '''permanent fund''' is one of the five [[Fund Accounting|governmental fund]] types established by [[U.S. generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]]. It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a permanent fund may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, as in the case of Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their permanent fund from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through [[List of GASB Statements|GASB Statement 34]]. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a permanent fund if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that '''only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal'''. For example, a fund can be classified as a permanent fund if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or [[financial endowment]]s towards a government-run library.

A common misconception is that permanent funds are required for special-purpose government entities that solely engage in business-type activities. However, this is not the case. According to Statement 34, that special-purpose government entity needs only to report the net balance of the restricted resources.

'''''Philosophy as Cultural Politics: Philosophical Papers: v.4''''' is a 2007 book by [[Richard Rorty]], the late Professor of Comparative Literature, Emeritus, at [[Stanford University]]. A compilation of selected philosophical papers written by Rorty between 1997 and 2007, it complements three previous selections of his papers.

==Contents==
In this book, Rorty explores the relation between [[philosophy]] and [[culture]].

Topics covered include:
# the changing role of philosophy in Western culture over the course of recent centuries,
# the role of the imagination in intellectual and moral progress,
# the notion of 'moral identity',
# Wittgenstein's claim that the problems of philosophy are linguistic in nature,
# the irrelevance of cognitive science to philosophy
# the mistaken idea that philosophers should find the 'place' of such things as consciousness and moral value in a world of physical particles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14366">A '''pocket veto''' is a legislative maneuver that allows a [[president]] or other official with [[veto]] power to exercise that power over a bill by taking no action (instead of affirmatively vetoing it).

==Finland==
The [[President of Finland]] has the power to pocket veto bills passed by the [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]]; however, such vetoes are temporary in effect.

==India==
Article 111 of the Indian constitution stipulates that the [[President of India|President]] shall give assent to a bill passed by both houses of the parliament or return the bill as soon as possible for reconsideration with his recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-indexenglish.htm |title=THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] does not give a specific time limit for presidential action on a bill sent by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing action on a bill, the president effectively vetoes it. However, if a president receives a bill he or she had previously vetoed and sent back to Parliament, where such a veto has been overruled by another Parliamentary vote, then such a bill becomes an act within fourteen days of the President's receiving it regardless of his or her subsequent action or inaction.&lt;ref name="intro india"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to the Constitution of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;pg=PA145 | publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Learning Pvt.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zail Singh]], President of India from 1982 until 1987, exercised a pocket veto to prevent the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill from becoming law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/09spec.htm | title=How Kalam asserted presidential power | work=Rediff India | date=June 9, 2006 | accessdate=April 15, 2014 | last=Bhatt | first=Sheela}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Indian Supreme Court has not upheld the right of presidents to veto bills in this manner{{citation required|date=March 2018}}.

==United States==
A pocket veto occurs when a bill fails to become law because the president does not sign the bill and cannot return the bill to Congress within a 10-day period because Congress is not in session. Article 1, Section 7 of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a Law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a Law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Constitution limits the president's period for decision on whether to sign or return any legislation to ten days (not including Sundays) while the [[United States Congress]] is in session. A return veto happens when the president sends a bill, along with his objections, back to the house of Congress from which it originated. Congress can override the veto by a two-thirds vote of both chambers, whereupon the bill becomes law. If Congress prevents the bill's return by being adjourned during the 10-day period, and the president does not sign the bill, a "pocket veto" occurs and the bill does not become law. Congress can adjourn and designate an agent to receive veto messages and other communications so that a pocket veto cannot happen, an action Congresses have routinely taken for decades. If a bill is pocket vetoed while Congress is out of session, the only way for Congress to circumvent the pocket veto is to reintroduce the legislation as a new bill, pass it through both chambers, and present it to the President again for signature. On the other hand, Congress may override a regular veto without introducing new legislation through the process described in the U.S. Constitution. [[James Madison]] became the first president to use the pocket veto in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30909.pdf |title=The Pocket Veto: Its Current Status |last=Fisher |first=Louis |publisher=United States Senate |date=March 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Presidents throughout United States history, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had an outstanding number of pocket vetoes, more than anyone before or after him. During his presidency from 1933-1945 Roosevelt had vetoed 635 bills, 263 of which were pocket vetoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/Presidents/RooseveltF.pdf|title=U.S. Senate: Vetoes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.senate.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the presidents after him until George W. Bush had pocket vetoes pass while they were in office; the one with the most after Roosevelt was Dwight D. Eisenhower who had 108. George W. Bush and Barack H. Obama both had zero pocket vetoes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Vetoes|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
Courts have never fully clarified when an adjournment by Congress would "prevent" the president from returning a vetoed bill. Some presidents have interpreted the Constitution to restrict the pocket veto to the [[adjournment sine die]] of Congress at the end of the second session of the two-year congressional term, while others interpreted it to allow intersession and intrasession pocket vetoes. In 1929, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' that a bill had to be returned to the chamber while it is in session and capable of work. While upholding President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pocket veto, the court said that the "determinative question is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill". In 1938, the Supreme Court reversed itself in part in ''[[Wright v. U.S.]]'', ruling that Congress could designate agents on its behalf to receive veto messages when it was not in session, saying that the Constitution "does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return". A three-day recess of the Senate was considered a short enough time that the Senate could still act with "reasonable promptitude" on the veto. However, a five-month adjournment would be a long enough period to enable a pocket veto. Within those constraints, there still exists some ambiguity. Presidents have been reluctant to pursue disputed pocket vetoes to the Supreme Court for fear of an adverse ruling that would serve as a precedent in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/GOV/leg_gloss.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207060840/http://www.lib.umd.edu/GOV/leg_gloss.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 |title=Glossary of Legislative Terminology |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in citation|date=May 2016}}

===George W. Bush===
In December 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] claimed that he had pocket vetoed {{nowrap|{{USBill|110|H.R.|1585}}}}, the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071228-5.html |title=Memorandum of Disapproval |publisher=The White House|date=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the House of Representatives had designated agents to receive presidential messages before adjourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/46161.html |title=Is Bush Inventing Another Constitutional Power? |last=Spitzer |first=Robert J. |publisher=History News Network |date=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had been previously passed by veto-proof majorities in both the House and the Senate. If the president had chosen to veto the bill, he would have been required to return it to the chamber in which it originated, in this case the House of Representatives. The House then could have voted to override the veto, and the Senate could have done likewise. In the event that each house had voted by at least two-thirds vote to override the veto, the bill would have become law.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Clause 2 reads "Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States: If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law."&lt;/ref&gt;

Then House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-CA) stated: "Congress vigorously rejects any claim that the president has the authority to pocket veto this legislation and will treat any bill returned to the Congress as open to an override vote."&lt;ref name="TPM"&gt;Paul Kiel, [http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/005010.php "Today's Must Read"], [http://talkingpointsmemo.com/ ''Talking Points Memorandum''], January 3, 2008. Retrieved 2010-02-03&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2008, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel stated: "A pocket veto, as you know, is essentially putting it in your pocket and not taking any action whatsoever. And when Congress – the House is out of session – in this case it's our view that bill then would not become law."&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt;

Louis Fisher, a constitutional scholar at the [[Library of Congress]] indicated: "The administration would be on weak grounds in court because they would be insisting on what the Framers decidedly rejected: an absolute veto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/13989-democrats-say-bush-cant-pocket-veto-defense-bill|title=Democrats say Bush can't pocket veto defense bill|last=Alarkon|first=Walter|date=January 2, 2008|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; By "absolute veto" Fisher was referring to the fact that a bill that has been pocket vetoed cannot be overridden. Instead, the bill must be reintroduced into both houses of Congress, and again passed by both houses, an effort which can be very difficult to achieve.

In the end, the House of Representatives did not attempt to override the veto. Instead, in January 2008, the House effectively killed H.R. 1585 by referring it to the Armed Services Committee and passing H.R. 4986, a bill nearly identical to H.R. 1585 but slightly modified to meet the President's objection, which subsequently became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-4986 |title=H.R. 4986: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 |publisher=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the first time that a president has attempted to pocket veto a bill despite the presence of agents to receive his veto message. Both [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] made similar attempts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidential-Vetoes/Presidential-Vetoes/ |title=Presidential Vetoes |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] used it against the [[Wade-Davis Bill]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Spitzer, "The Law: The 'Protective Return' Pocket Veto: Presidential Aggrandizement of Constitutional Power", ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'', vol. 31, no. 4, Dec. 2001, pp. 720–732.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana===
After nearly a century of pocket vetoes, the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] ruled pocket vetoes unconstitutional in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''State ex rel. Mass Transportation Authority v. Indiana Revenue Board'', 251 Ind. 607, 244 N.E.2d 111 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Edgar Whitcomb]] requested that the General Assembly pass an act repealing all laws that were enacted because of the Supreme Court decision, some of which were nearly a century old.  The assembly complied with the request and passed a blanket repeal.&lt;ref name = g405&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Gugin, Linda C. |editor2=St. Clair, James E |title=The Governors of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Society Press|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|year=2006|isbn=0-87195-196-7|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other use==
Because a pocket veto cannot be overridden, it is sometimes used to describe situations where either one person, or a small group, can override the will of a much larger group without consequence. For example, when the [[California Supreme Court]] was answering the [[certified question]] of intervenor standing in the case of ''[[Perry v. Brown]]'' (known as the [[Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] case), one of the justices expressed concern that denying appellate standing to initiative proponents would mean that the governor and state attorney general would "essentially get a 'pocket veto{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2011/09/06/live-blogging-todays-ca-supreme-court-hearing-on-standing-in-the-prop-8-perry-case/|title=Live-blogging: Today’s CA Supreme Court hearing on standing in the Prop 8 (Perry) case|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2553">In Canada a '''policy jury''' or citizen jury is a body of people convened to render a decision or advice on a matter of public policy. It is similar to juries used in modern court trial except that the subject of its deliberation is a matter of public policy, rather than law. The concept of the policy jury is closely connected with [[deliberative democracy]] or [[participatory]] models of democratic governance, and is similar to a [[deliberative opinion poll]].

In some cases, policy juries are composed of randomly selected members of a given population. Citizens participating in a policy jury engage in a comprehensive learning and deliberation processes before settling on a conclusion or set of recommendations.

Policy juries have been used in [[Canada]]. Citizens’ Assemblies on Electoral Reform convened in British Columbia in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca/public |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924143403/http://citizensassembly.bc.ca/public |archivedate=2005-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ontario in 2006&lt;ref&gt;

Three of Ontario’s Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) have referred their Integrated Health Service Plans (IHSP) for 2010-2013 to policy juries for advice and refinement. LHINs referring their IHSPs to policy juries include the South East LHIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southeastlhin.on.ca/Page.aspx?id=2346&lt;/ref&gt; Central LHIN and Mississauga Halton LHIN.

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

'''Political philosophy''', also known as '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[political science]], a strong focus has historically been placed on the role of political philosophy (also known as [[normative theory]]), [[moral philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], although in recent years there has been increased focus to political theory based on [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] methodological approaches as well as [[economic theory]], the [[natural sciences]] and [[behaviouralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savigny |first1=Heather |last2=Marsden |first2=Lee |title=Doing Political Science and International Relations: Theories in Action |date=2011 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9780230344136 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaUcBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0-7391-0401-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

Sewell and J. Debrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient China ====
Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least Plato.&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=... Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427–347 BC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: [[monarchy]], [[timocracy]],[[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law|law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# Divine positive law (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first [[speculative philosophy|speculative]] theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripaetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occurs because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-22|title=Averroes|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Averroes&amp;oldid=837663527|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-30|title=Siyasatnama|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siyasatnama&amp;oldid=788295179|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in [[Europe]] was heavily influenced by [[Christian]] thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s though subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L. S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] [[Europe]] through [[Muslim]] [[Spain]], along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown.

[[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the secure and powerful state. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]] led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, [[history|historians]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the [[United States]]: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in [[China]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]], as well as the events of [[May 1968]] led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective.These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with may be free, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Current emphasis on "commoditization of the everyday" has been decried by many contemporary theorists, some of them arguing the full brunt of it would be felt in ten years' time. "Pricing" such ethical categories like personal relations or sex, though always present, pushed by media agenda, is thus seen as crossing boundaries and having adverse societal and philosophical consequences.

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in [[Germany]], but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of conservative thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]].
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.
* [[Max Stirner]]: Important thinker within [[anarchism]] and the main representative of the anarchist current known as [[individualist anarchism]].
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[Neo-Conservativism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].
* [[Henry David Thoreau]]: Influential American thinker on such diverse later political positions and topics such as [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] who influenced later important political activists such as [[Martin Luther King]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].
* [[Voltaire|François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)]]: French Enlightenment writer, poet, and philosopher famous for his advocacy of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.
* [[Bernard Williams]]: A British moral philosopher whose posthumously published work on political philosophy ''In the Beginning was the Deed'' has been seen—along with the works of [[Raymond Geuss]]—as a key foundational work on political realism.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: A French political scientist and diplomat, known for his works ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]''.

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Postfeminism strives towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s. A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", and too "liberal", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;Modleski, Tania. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

== Contraceptives ==

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rallies ==

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Court halts RH law for 4 months

Oral arguments were set for June 18 but postponed until July 9 after the Supreme Court received additional petitions and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |title=SC postpones RH law oral arguments

|newspaper=GMA News Online
|date=June 4, 2013
|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;
{{cite news | title=Justices say Supreme Court cannot settle medical issues in RH law

|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral arguments concluded on August 27, with the petitioners against and for the law being instructed to submit memorandums within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">{{Hegelianism}}
The '''Right Hegelians''' ({{lang-de|Rechtshegelianer}}), '''Old Hegelians''' (''Althegelianer''), or '''the Hegelian Right''' (''die Hegelsche Rechte''), were those followers of [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in the early 19th century who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously [[conservative]] direction.  They are typically contrasted with the [[Young Hegelians]], who interpreted Hegel's [[political philosophy]] to support innovations in politics or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2026775|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|date=1987 |title= The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel and Habermas|last=Dallmayr|first=Fred|volume=84|pages=682–692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hegel's [[historicism]] holds that both ideas and institutions can only be understood by understanding their history.  Throughout his life, Hegel said he was an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]. He devoted considerable attention to [[the Absolute]], his term for the infinite Spirit responsible for the totality of reality—something like God, though not the God of classical theism. This Spirit comes to fullest expression in the historical reality of the modern state. In his ''Philosophy of Right'', Hegel writes that:

{{quotation|The [[Sovereign state|State]] is absolutely rational inasmuch as it is the actuality of the substantial will which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to consciousness of its universality. This substantial unity is an absolute unmoved end in itself, in which freedom comes into its supreme right. On the other hand this final end has supreme right against the individual, whose supreme duty is to be a member of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hegel, Georg H. W. 1821. Philosophy of Right. Trad. S. W. Dyde, 2008. Cosimo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aNa9-h-RGTMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=snippet&amp;q=state%20end%20individual&amp;f=false Google Print, p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;|''Philosophy of Right'', "The State", p. 258}}

The Hegelian right expanded this conception of [[statism]], seizing on it as an affirmation of establishment politics and orthodox religion.  Hegel's historicism could be read to affirm the historical inevitability of modern institutions; a [[nation]] was an [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]], existing in Hegelian [[idealism]] above and about the people who constituted it.  To argue for political change was to attack the Ideal of the national state.  The Right Hegelians believed that advanced [[Europe]]an societies, as they existed in the first half of the nineteenth century, were the summit of all social development, the product of the historical [[dialectic]] that had existed thus far.  Most praised the Prussian state, which enjoyed an extensive [[civil service]] system, good universities, [[industrialization]], and high [[employment]], as the acme of progress and the incarnation of the ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.

Many of the members of the Hegelian right went on to have distinguished careers in public academia or the Lutheran Church.  As a school, they were closely associated with the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and held many of the chairs of philosophy and theology there.  Generally, the philosophers of the Hegelian right have been neglected; their fame, if not their reputations, has been eclipsed by the [[Young Hegelians]], including [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Karl Marx]]. They left their mark chiefly in theology.  Their efforts did not have the intended effect of bolstering a sense of the inevitability of faith as a product of history; rather, they pioneered the introduction of [[higher criticism]] by demonstrating the influence of an era on the development of Christianity.

Philosophers within the camp of the Hegelian right include:

* [[Johann Philipp Gabler]]
* [[Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs]]
* [[Karl Daub]]
* [[Heinrich Leo]]
* [[Leopold von Henning]]
* [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]]

Other thinkers or historians who may be included among the Hegelian right, with some reservations, include:

* [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]]
* [[Eduard Gans]]
* [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]]
* [[Philip Marheineke]]
* [[Wilhelm Vatke]]
* [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]]
* [[Eduard Zeller]]
* [[Albert Schwegler]]
* [[Hans Lassen Martensen]]

'''Science policy''' is concerned with the allocation of resources for the conduct of science towards the goal of best serving the public interest.  Topics include the [[funding of science]], the careers of scientists, and the translation of scientific discoveries into [[technological innovation]] to promote [[commercial product development]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], [[economic growth]] and [[economic development]].  Science policy focuses on knowledge production and role of knowledge networks, collaborations and the complex distributions of expertise, equipment and know-how. Understanding the processes and organizational context of generating novel and innovative science and engineering ideas is a core concern of science policy. Science policy topics include [[weapons development]], [[health care]] and [[environmental monitoring]].

Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve science.  A large and complex web of factors influences the development of science and
engineering that includes government science policy makers, private firms (including both national and multi-national firms), social
movements, media, non-governmental organizations, universities, and other research institutions. In addition, science policy is increasingly international as defined by the global operations of firms and research institutions as well as by the collaborative networks of non-governmental
organizations and of the nature of scientific inquiry itself. 

==History==
{{main|History of science policy}}

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States period]] in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bray (1984), ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' '''VI.2''' '''''Agriculture'''''&lt;/ref&gt; for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and for  the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a [[civil service]], the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholars]], some of whom demonstrated great mastery of [[hydraulics]].

In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that "each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army."&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] (1638) [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109891&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Two New Sciences], Salviati, first day of the dialogs&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain]], [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of "experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Francis Bacon]] (1624). ''[[New Atlantis]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which today we call the [[crucial experiment]].  Governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s computer.

The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and State funding of universities of their respective nations. In the United States, a member of the National Academy of Sciences can sponsor a Direct Submission for publication in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml#submission PNAS Submission Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; ''PNAS'' serves as a channel to recognize research of importance to at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations who fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

==Philosophies of science policy==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}

===Basic versus applied research===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

The programs that are funded are often divided into four basic categories: [[basic research]], [[applied research]], [[Research and development|development]], and facilities and equipment.&lt;ref name="AAASpresentation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemins|first=Patrick|title=R&amp;D in the President's FY 2011 Budget|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/presentations/|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed (lead)|date=December 2014}}  [[Translational research]] is a newer concept that seeks to bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications.

Basic science attempts to stimulate breakthroughs. Breakthroughs often lead to an explosion of new technologies and approaches.  Once the basic result is developed, it is widely published; however conversion into a practical product is left for the free market.  However, many governments have developed risk-taking research and development organizations to take basic theoretical research over the edge into practical [[engineering]].  In the [[United States|U.S.]], this function is performed by [[DARPA]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On the other hand, technology development is a policy in which engineering, the application of science, is supported rather than basic science.  The emphasis is usually given to projects that increase important strategic or commercial engineering knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The most extreme{{dubious|date=December 2014}} success story is doubtless the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Another remarkable success story was the "X-vehicle" studies that gave the US a lasting lead in aerospace technologies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

These exemplify two disparate approaches: The Manhattan Project was huge, and spent unblinkingly on the most risky alternative approaches.  The project members believed that failure would result in their enslavement or destruction by [[Nazi Germany]].  Each X-project built an aircraft whose only purpose was to develop a particular technology.  The plan was to build a few cheap aircraft of each type, fly a test series, often to the destruction of an aircraft, and never design an aircraft for a practical mission.  The only mission was technology development.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A number of high-profile technology developments have failed.  The US Space Shuttle failed to meet its cost or flight schedule goals.  Most observers explain the project as over constrained: the cost goals too aggressive, the technology and mission too underpowered and undefined.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Japanese [[fifth generation computer systems project]] met every technological goal, but failed to produce commercially important [[artificial intelligence]].  Many observers{{Who|date=December 2014}} believe that the Japanese tried to force engineering beyond available science by brute investment.  Half the amount spent on basic research rather might have produced ten times the result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Utilitarian versus monumental science policy ===
[[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] policies prioritize scientific projects that significantly reduce [[suffering]] for larger numbers of people.  This approach would mainly consider the numbers of people that can be helped by a research policy.  Research is more likely to be supported when it costs less and has greater benefits.  Utilitarian research often pursues incremental improvements rather than dramatic advancements in knowledge, or break-through solutions, which are more commercially viable/feasible.

In contrast, monumental science is a policy in which science is supported for the sake of a greater understanding of the universe, rather than for specific short-term practical goals.  This designation covers both large projects, often with large facilities, and smaller research that does not have obvious practical applications and are often overlooked.  While these projects may not always have obvious practical outcomes, they provide education of future scientists, and advancement of scientific knowledge of lasting worth about the basic building blocks of science.&lt;ref name=Vuong2018&gt;{{cite journal|title=The (ir)rational consideration of the cost of science in transition economies|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|volume=2|issue=1|pages=5|date=January 1, 2018|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0281-4|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0281-4|accessdate=January 2, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical outcomes do result from many of these "monumental" science programs.  Sometimes these practical outcomes are foreseeable and sometimes they are not.  A classic example of a monumental science program focused towards a practical outcome is the [[Manhattan project]].  An example of a monumental science program that produces unexpected practical outcome is the [[laser]].  Coherent light, the principle behind lasing, was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, but not created until 1954 by Charles H. Townes with the [[maser]].  The breakthrough with the maser led to the creation of the laser in 1960 by Theodore Maiman.  The delay between the theory of coherent light and the production of the laser was partially due to the assumption that it would be of no practical use.&lt;ref&gt;Suplee, Curt (1999) ''Physics In The 20th Century'' Harry N. Abrams Inc, 58-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic conservation===
This policy approach prioritizes efficiently teaching all available science to those who can use it, rather than investing in new science.  In particular, the goal is not to ''lose'' any existing knowledge, and to find new practical ways to apply the available knowledge.  The classic success stories of this method occurred in the 19th century U.S. land-grant universities, which established a strong tradition of research in practical agricultural and engineering methods.  More recently, the [[Green Revolution]] prevented mass famine over the last thirty years.  The focus, unsurprisingly, is usually on developing a robust curriculum and inexpensive practical methods to meet local needs.

== Science policy by country ==

Most developed countries usually have a specific national body overseeing national science (including technology and innovation) policy. In the case developing countries many follow the same fashion.  Many governments of [[developed country|developed countries]] provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as [[physics]] and [[geology]]) as well as social science research (in fields such as [[economics]] and [[history]]). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal]]s.

A funding body is an organisation that provides [[research funding]] in the form of [[research grant]]s or [[scholarship]]s.  Research councils are the funding bodies that are government-funded agencies engaged in the support of research in different disciplines and postgraduate funding.  Funding from research councils is typically competitive. As a general rule, more funding is available in science and engineering disciplines than in the arts and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Funding_my_further_study/Public_funding_bodies/p!ejclk | title = Public funding bodies | work = [[Graduate Prospects]] | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the two main research councils are the [[Australian Research Council]] and the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]].

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the three main research councils ("Tri-Council") are the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] (SSHRC) the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]] (NSERC) and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR). Additional research funding agencies include the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], [[Genome Canada]], [[Sustainable Development Technology Canada]] and several Tri-Council supported [[Networks of Centres of Excellence]]. [http://www.nce.gc.ca/]

===Brazil===

In Brazil, two important research agencies are the [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq, Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), an organization of the Brazilian federal government under the Ministry of Science and Technology, and [[São Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP, Portuguese: Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo), a public foundation located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil [http://www.fapesp.br/en/].

===European Union===
The science policy of the [[European Union]] is carried out through the [[European Research Area]], which is a system that integrates the scientific resources of member nations and acts as a "common market" for research and innovation purpose.  The European Union's executive body, the [[European Commission]], has a [[Directorate-General for Research (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research]]; which is responsible for the Union's science policy.  In addition, the [[Joint Research Centre]] provides independent scientific and technical advice to the European Commission and Member States of the [[European Union]] (EU) in support of EU policies.&lt;ref name="a1370"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm?id=1370 | title=EU Science Hub - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also the recently established [[European Research Council]], the first European Union [[Funding of science|funding body]] set up to support investigator-driven research.

There are also European science agencies that operate independently of the European Union, such as the [[European Science Foundation]], [[European Space Agency]], and the [[European Higher Education Area]]; which are created by the [[Bologna process]].

On science policy and on the European Research Area is grounded the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which addresses global challenges of pivotal importance for the well-being of the European citizens within the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
German research funding agencies include the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which covers both [[science]] and [[humanities]].

=== India ===
Research funding by the Government of India comes from a number of sources.  For basic science and technology research, these include the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology (DST), and University Grants Commission (UGC).  For medical research, these include the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), CSIR, DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  For applied research, these include the CSIR, DBT and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).

Other funding authorities are the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unom.ac.in/gcl-opac/Research%20funding.htm#Indian%20Research%20Funding%20Agencies&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Irish funding councils include the Irish Research Council (IRC) and the [[Science Foundation Ireland]]. The prior [[IRCSET|Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology]] (IRCSET) and the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) were merged to form the IRC in March 2012.&lt;ref name="IRC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ie/aboutus/about-irc | title=About Us | publisher=Irish Research Council | accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
Dutch research funding agencies include [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO) [http://nwo.nl/] and [[Agentschap NL]] [http://www.agentschapnl.nl/].

=== Pakistan ===
The Government of Pakistan has mandated that a certain percentage of gross revenue generated by all telecom service providers be allocated to development and research of information and communication technologies. The [[National ICT R&amp;D Fund (Pakistan)|National ICT R&amp;D Fund]] was established in January 2007.

===Russia===
Under the Soviet Union, much research was routinely [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|suppressed]].
Now science in Russia is supported by state and private funds. From the state: the Russian Humanitarian Scientific Foundation (http://www.rfh.ru), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (www.rfbr.ru), the Russian Science Foundation (http://rscf.ru)

=== Switzerland ===
Swiss research funding agencies include the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] (SNSF), the innovation promotion agency CTI (CTI/KTI), Ressortforschung des Bundes [http://www.ressortforschung.admin.ch/], and Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht [http://www.edi.admin.ch/esv/].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Research Councils UK}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Haldane principle]], that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is still influential in research policy. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the [[Science Policy Research Unit]]. There are seven grant-awarding [[Research Councils UK|Research Councils]]:
* [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC)
* [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC)
* [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC)
* [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC)
* [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC)
* [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC)
* [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC)

===United States===
{{main|Science policy of the United States}}

The [[United States]] has a long history of government support specially for science and technology.  Science policy in the United States is the responsibility of many organizations throughout the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].  Much of the large-scale policy is made through the legislative [[United States budget process|budget process]] of enacting the yearly [[United States federal budget|federal budget]].  Further decisions are made by the various federal agencies which spend the funds allocated by Congress, either on in-house research or by granting funds to outside organizations and researchers.

Research funding agencies in the United States are spread among many different departments, which include:
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]])
* [[United States Department of Energy]] Office of Science
* [[National Institutes of Health]]: biomedical research
* [[National Science Foundation]]: fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* [[Office of Naval Research]]

[[File:bouchedefer.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''La Bouche de fer'' (''Mouth of Iron'')]]

The '''Society of the Friends of Truth''' ('''Amis de la Verité'''), also known as the '''Social Club''' (French: 
''Cercle social''), was a French revolutionary organization founded in 1790. It was "a mixture of revolutionary political club, the Masonic Lodge, and a literary salon".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''Historical Dictionary of the French Revolution'', PUF, 1989, page 196&lt;/ref&gt;  It also published an influential revolutionary newspaper, the ''Mouth of Iron''.

==The inception==
The Society of the Friends of Truth was established by [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], who announced its birth in the popular press on 21 February 1790. The original purpose of the club was to become a "clearing-house" for correspondence between and among scholars from all over Europe. In the spirit of its founders, the club wished to cultivate a "public mandate" under which its activities would be governed. Thus, its newsletter, ''Mouth of Iron'' (''La Bouche de fer''), solicited letters from readers to comment on political affairs and to issue denunciations of counter-revolutionary plots.

The club was actually launched in the month of October 1790, when the sessions "of the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth" at the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] started. Before an audience that ranged from five thousand to eight thousand people every week, Claude Fauchet, self-appointed "attorney of Truth", lectured on [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 work ''[[The Social Contract]]''. The club also formulated political theories on democratic government, ultimately dismissing direct democracy in favor of a system that resembled a popularly elected dictatorship that could be dismissed by the citizens whenever its actions became insupportable. The Social Club also advocated steps toward a more equitable distribution of wealth, always with an eye to Rousseau's ideals, but the club did ''not'' support land reform.

The meetings were described in detail in the "Mouth of Iron", which published the proceedings of the Fauchet lectures and discussions and the mail that arrived following them. This publication is important for understanding the genesis of democratic ideas during the [[French Revolution]]. The Social Club was also the first revolutionary group to identify itself clearly as a ''cosmopolitan organization'', meaning that its aims superseded national boundaries. It made appeals to scholars worldwide, and it produced a polyglot edition of the 1791 Constitution for distribution globally. Its goal was to create a universal republic led by scholars.

==Membership and adherents==
Key figures attending the Social Club included [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and [[Claude Fauchet (revolutionist)|Claude Fauchet]], as well as [[Sylvain Maréchal]], [[François-Noël Babeuf|"Gracchus" Babeuf]], [[:fr:Guillaume-François-Charles Goupil de Préfeln|Goupil de Préfeln]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Bertrand Barère]], and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]]. About one-hundred-thirty persons were members and attended meetings regularly.

The meetings were public because the club wanted to show the widest possible audience what discourse in the atmosphere of a [[Salon (gathering)|literary or philosophical salon]] might accomplish. (This explains the choice of the [[Cirque du Palais-Royal]] as a meeting-place, rather than some smaller venue like a private home.) Spectators were invited to ask questions, and a resolution was passed at the end of each session.

In 1791, the membership of the Social Club openly declared themselves [[Republicanism#French and Swiss thought|republicans]]. It then became a meeting place for the [[Girondist]]s, who rivaled the [[Jacobins]] for primacy of republican ideology and action. The club's political orientation was liberal, and it promoted the ideal of a society composed of small and medium economic producers: craftsmen, farmers, merchants, and entrepreneurs.

The members of the Social Club also considered themselves contemporary feminists, and while no remarkable feminist change would come out of the club, the members of the club helped individually to develop the framework for what would become the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]''. [[Olympe de Gouges]], the author of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman'', was a member of the club and would often develop her ideas through the liberal conduit of the Social Club. While the members did proclaim themselves supporters of republican ideals publicly, their embrace of feminists ideals was regarded as much more treasonous (and as such, was quite under wraps).&lt;ref&gt;Dickenson, Donna. ''Margaret Fuller: Writing a Woman's Life''. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993). {{ISBN|0-312-09145-1}}, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1791 on, the club's offices operated a publishing business. It became a center for the dissemination of revolutionary literature, including numerous newspapers, political pamphlets, theatrical works, poetry, posters, etc. A number of seminal authors, [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier#Political views|Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Nicolas-Edme Rétif de la Bretonne]], [[Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Condorcet]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], and [[Jean-Marie Roland]], were published under the club's auspices.

After the fall of the Girondins, the club dissolved. Fauchet was arrested and executed on 31 October 1793. Bonneville, the printer, resumed activity after [[9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794). His press tried to resurrect the Social Club, but it never regained its previous audience. In a fragmented state, it continued to exist until [[Brumaire]] of year VIII (November 1800). By then, ideologues like [[Pierre Claude François Daunou|Daunou]], [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Volney]], [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]], and [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Berthollet]] held center stage.

The ''Amis de la Verité'' was fondly remembered, and it became a touchstone for the romantics of the nineteenth century, like [[Charles Nodier]] and [[Victor Hugo]], but it was also highly esteemed among politicians and social theorists such as [[Charles Fourier]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Karl Marx]].

''La Bouche de fer'', the ''Mouth of Iron'', may have derived its name, sardonically, from [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]]'s observation about [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 96 BC)|the consul, Domitius]], "that it was no wonder that a man who had a beard of brass, also had a mouth of iron and a heart of lead."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' xviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suet"&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero,'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ix. 1. § 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' ii. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Others hold that the name comes from a mailbox in the shape of a lion's mouth, located at the headquarters of the club, at No. 4, rue du Théâtre-Français, where letters, petitions, proposals, denunciations, screeds, and other treatises could be deposited. A third theory is that this name, ''Mouth of Iron'', was the same name as a lodge of freemasons to which Bonneville and Fauchet had once belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Copin-Albancelli]], ''Le drame maçonnique. Le Pouvoir occulte contre la France'', 1908, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the ''Mouth of Iron'' was published in Paris between October 1790 and 28 July 1791, at first, three times per week, then daily, beginning on 22 June 1791. The newsletter contained comments on "The Social Contract" of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, essays by Claude Fauchet, transcripts of speeches by Condorcet, petitions from the ''Club of the [[Cordeliers]]'', etc. A subscription cost thirty-six pounds (livres) per year, and anyone who subscribed was automatically made a member of the Social Club; so, since casual readers and curiosity-seekers were counted as members, the size of the club's membership was probably somewhat overstated.

''La Bouche de fer'' was the origin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of the famous quote, often attributed to [[Denis Diderot]]: ''"Quand le dernier des rois sera pendu avec les boyaux du dernier prêtre célibataire, le genre humain pourra espérer être heureux."'' ("When the last king is hanged with the entrails of the last celibate priest, mankind may hope to be happy.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">{{other uses|Greyshirt (disambiguation)}}
'''Greyshirts''' or '''''Gryshemde''''' is the common short-form name given to the '''South African Gentile National Socialist Movement''', a [[South Africa]]n [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement that existed during the 1930s and 1940s. Initially referring only to a paramilitary group, it soon became shorthand for the movement as a whole.

The [[NSDAP/AO]] arrived in South Africa in 1932 and as a result a number of groups sympathetic to Nazism emerged. The most notable of these was the South African Gentile National Socialist Movement (also known as the South African Christian National Socialist Movement), formed by [[Louis Weichardt]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A fiercely [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] group, it organised the Gryshemde as its equivalent of the [[Sturmabteilung]], although the grey shirt became so associated with the group that it was applied to the movement as a whole. In contrast to some extremist groups the Greyshirts did not split along linguistic lines, but rather sought to work with both the [[Afrikaans]] and the [[English language|English]]-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;Aletta J. Norval, ''Deconstructing Apartheid Discourse'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greyshirts struggled to maintain unity and spawned a number of minor splinter groups, such as Johannes von Moltke's South African Fascists. Most of these groups united under [[Daniel François Malan]]'s aegis when he formed his [['Purified' National Party]], although the Greyshirts did not take part and contested the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 election]] alone. The decision proved unwise, however, as the Greyshirts failed to make any impact.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The group was roundly attacked by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], with an article appearing in ''[[Die Burger]]'' in October 1934 stating that: 'We believe that this party, generally known as the Greyshirts, under the cloak of an anti-Jewish movement, strives for a dangerous form of government in South Africa. The Greyshirts have as their aim to set up a dictator in South Africa.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html Followers of Hitler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html |date=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jew]]ish immigration from [[Nazi Germany]] to South Africa grew significantly during the 1930s and the Greyshirts launched a campaign calling for an end to the practice. A ship was chartered by the Council for German Jewry, a UK-based group, to bring as many Jews as possible to [[Cape Town]], leading to the Greyshirts organising a mass protest against the move. The scale of opposition was such that [[Sarah Millin]] appealed to [[Jan Smuts]] to deal with the Greyshirts, although her request was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Bathsheba Braude, 'Introduction', ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in South Africa: An Anthology''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, relations between the National Party and the Greyshirts actually improved, initially as a result of a 1937 letter from [[Frans Erasmus]], at the time Secretary of the National Party, praising the Greyshirts for bringing the "Jewish problem" to the fore and culminating in a number of leading Greyshirts also holding National Party membership.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bunting, ''The Rise of the South African Reich'', Penguin Books, 1969, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities were monitored during the [[Second World War]], although the Greyshirts continued to exist and renamed themselves the White Workers Party in 1949. However, by this time most of the membership had been lost to the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] and so the Greyshirts faded.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9063">In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]] the term '''tenant-in-chief'''  (or '''vassal-in-chief'''), denoted a person who held his lands under various forms of [[feudal land tenure]]  directly from the king or territorial prince to whom he did homage, as opposed to holding them from another nobleman or senior member of the [[clergy]].&lt;ref name=Bloch333&gt;Bloch ''Feudal Society Volume 2'' p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict272&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms &amp; Phrases'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The tenure was one which denoted great honour, but also carried heavy responsibilities as the tenants-in-chief were originally responsible for providing knights and soldiers for the king's feudal army.&lt;ref&gt;Bracton, who indiscriminately called tenants-in-chief "barons" stated: "sunt et alii potentes sub rege qui barones dicuntur, hoc est robur belli" ("there are other magnates under the king, who are called barons, that is the hardwood of war"), quoted in Sanders, I.J., Feudal Military Service in England, Oxford, 1956, p.3; "Bracton's definition of the ''baro''" (plur ''barones'') "proves that tenants of this class were considered to be the military backbone of the realm" (Sanders, p.3)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Feudal status}}
==Etymology==
Other names for tenant-in-chief were [[captal]] or [[baron]],{{efn|Baron was the term used in the ''Cartae Baronum'' of 1166, a return of all tenants-in-chief, not just those who held per baroniam.}} although the latter term came to mean specifically one who held in-chief by the tenure ''per baroniam'', the [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]].&lt;ref name=Bloch333/&gt; The [[Latin]] term was ''tenens in [[capite]]''.&lt;ref name=Coredon161&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Tenens (singular), tenentes (plur)}}

==History==
In most countries [[Allodial title|allodial property]] could be held by laypeople or the church; however in England after the [[Norman Conquest]], the king became in law the only holder of land by allodial title; thus all the lands in England became the property of the Crown.&lt;ref name="ganshof130"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ganshof165"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; A tenure by [[frankalmoin]], which in other countries was regarded as a form of privileged allodial holding, was in England regarded as a [[Tenement (law)|feudal tenement]].  Every land-holding  was deemed by feudal custom to be no more than an  [[estate in land]] whether directly or indirectly held  of the king; absolute title in land could only be held by the king himself, the most anyone else could hold was a right over land, not a title in land ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ganshof165"/&gt; In England, a tenant-in-chief could enfief, or grant fiefs carved out of his own holding, to his own followers. The creation of subfiefs under a tenant-in-chief or other fief-holder was known as [[subinfeudation]].&lt;ref name=Word240&gt;Cosman ''Medieval Wordbook'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman kings, however, eventually imposed on all free men (i.e. those whose tenures were "freehold", that is to say for life or heritable by their heirs) who occupied a tenement a duty of [[fealty]] to the crown rather than to their immediate lord who had enfeoffed them. This was to diminish the possibility of sub-vassals being employed by tenants-in-chief against the crown.&lt;ref name="ganshof165"/&gt;

In the great feudal survey [[Domesday Book]] (1087), tenants-in-chief were listed first in each county's entry.&lt;ref name=Dict272/&gt;. The lands held by a tenant-in-chief in England, if comprising a large [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]], were called an [[honour (feudal land tenure)|honour]].&lt;ref name="ganshof166"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties of tenants-in-chief==
As feudal lord, the king had the right to collect [[scutage]] from the barons who held these ''honours''.&lt;ref name="bartlett164"&gt;Bartlett ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Scutage (literally ''shield money'', from ''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]'') was a tax collected from vassals in lieu of military service. The payment of scutage rendered the crown more independent of the [[Feudalism|feudal levy]] and enabled it to pay for troops on its own.&lt;ref name="ganshof166"/&gt; Once a tenant-in-chief received a demand for scutage, the cost was passed on to the sub-tenants and thus came to be regarded as a universal land tax.&lt;ref name="bartlett164"/&gt; This tax was a development from the taxation system created under the Anglo-Saxon kings to raise money to pay off the invading Danes, the so-called [[Danegeld]].&lt;ref name="bartlett165"&gt;Bartlett ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heirs===
When an English tenant-in-chief died, an [[inquisition post mortem]] was held in each county in which he held land and his or her land temporarily [[escheat]]ed (i.e.reverted) to the [[demesne]] of the crown until the heir paid a sum of money (a [[Feudal relief|relief]]), and was then able to take possession ([[livery of seisin]]) of the lands. However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a ''feudal wardship'' where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.&lt;ref name=national1&gt;''Court of Wards and Liveries: land inheritance 1540–1645''&lt;/ref&gt;

When an heir came of age, he or she passed out of wardship but could not enter upon their inheritance until, like all heirs of full age on inheritance, they had sued out their livery. In either case, the process was complicated.&lt;ref name=national1/&gt; Eventually a warrant was issued for the livery to pass under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]].&lt;ref name=national1/&gt; From its inception in 1540, The [[Court of Wards and Liveries]] administered the funds received from the wardships, marriages and the granting of livery; both courts and practice were abolished in 1646&lt;ref name="friar465"&gt;Friar ''Sutton Companion to Local History'' p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; and the whole system of feudal tenure&amp;nbsp;— except for [[fee simple]] - was abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82746">The '''Tibetan sovereignty debate''' refers to two [[political]] debates. The first is whether the various territories within the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) that are claimed as political [[Tibet]] should [[separatism|separate]] and become a new [[sovereign state]]. Many of the points in the debate rest on a second debate, about whether Tibet was independent or subordinate to China in certain parts of its recent history.

It is generally agreed that China and Tibet were independent prior to the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368),&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20.  Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tibet has been ruled by the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.17. Shakya (1999) p.90.  Latourette (1964) p.419. Spence (1999) p.500.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of Tibet's relationship with China in the intervening period is a matter of debate.  The PRC claims that Tibet has been a part of China since the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Nyima (1997) p.20. Grunfeld (1996) p.256.  Sperling (2004) p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) claimed that "Tibet was placed under the sovereignty of  China" when the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) [[Sino-Nepalese War|ended the brief Nepalese rule]] (1788-1792) from parts of Tibet in c. 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) pp.6,7.  Goldstein (1989) p.72.  Both cite the ROC's position paper at the 1914 Simla Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] claims that Tibet was an independent state until the PRC invaded Tibet in 1949/50.&lt;ref&gt;Sperling (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/tibet/five-point-peace-plan|title=Five Point Peace Plan|publisher=The Dalai Lama|date=21 September 1987|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western scholars claim that Tibet and China were ruled by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Feigon (1996) p.58. Gernet (1972) pp.369, 384.  Goldstein (1997) pp.3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming dynasty|Tibet was independent]] during the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1997) pp.4,5.

Feigon (1996) p.119 "border between the two countries" of China and Tibet in 1917.  Goldstein (1997) pp.30-37 Chapter titled "Interlude: De Facto Independence".  Latourette (1964) pp.333 "practically independent" from 1912, 419 "accepted the suzerainity of the Communists" in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; although it had extremely limited international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/china/question-tibet/p15965#p2|title=The Question of Tibet|publisher=Council of Foreign Relations|quote=Western countries, including Britain and the United States, did not recognize Tibet as fully independent|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, China adopted the Western model of nation-state diplomacy. As the government of Tibet, China concluded several treaties (1876, 1886, 1890, 1893) with [[British Raj|British India]] touching on the status, boundaries and access to Tibet.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14718a.htm The ''Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIV. Published 1912: Tibet'']&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government sources consider this a sign of [[sovereignty]] rather than [[suzerainty]]. However, by the 20th century British India found the treaties to be ineffective due to China's weakened control over the Tibetan local government. [[British expedition to Tibet|The British invaded Tibet]] in 1904 and forced the signing of a separate treaty, directly with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. In 1906, an [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Anglo-Chinese Convention] was signed at Peking between Great Britain and China. It incorporated the 1904 Lhasa Convention (with modification), which was attached as Annex.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treaty1906"&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty between Britain and Russia (1907) followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)]&lt;/ref&gt; Article II of this treaty stated that "In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government." China sent troops into Tibet in 1908. The result of the policy of both Great Britain and Russia has been the virtual annexation of Tibet by China.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; China controlled Tibet up to 1912. Thereafter, Tibet entered the period described commonly as ''de facto'' independence, though it was only recognized by independent Mongolia as enjoying ''de jure'' independence.

In the 2000s the position of the Republic of China with regard to Tibet appeared to become more nuanced as was stated in the following opening speech to the International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet on 8{{nbsp}}September 2007 through the pro-Taiwan independence then ROC President [[Chen Shui-bian]] who stated that his offices no longer treated exiled Tibetans as Chinese mainlanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/print.php?id=1105499543 'President Chen Shui-bian's Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the 2007 International Symposium on Human Rights in Tibet' Sep 8, 2007]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal arguments based on historical status===

The position of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled mainland China since 1949, as well as the official position of the Republic of China (ROC), which ruled mainland China before 1949 and currently controls Taiwan,&lt;ref&gt;For the PRC's position, see State Council's whitepaper [http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/tibet/ ''Tibet - Its Ownership and Human Rights Situation''], 1992 and Beijing Review's [http://www.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/index.htm ''100 Question about Tibet''], 1989; for ROC's position, see Government Information Office's [http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/92roc/pdfs/01-02-02.pdf online publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724210652/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/92roc/pdfs/01-02-02.pdf |date=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that Tibet has been an indivisible part of China ''[[de jure]]'' since the [[Yuan dynasty]] of Mongol-ruled China in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, [http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html ''Reassessing Tibet Policy''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906034739/http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol5/v5n09tibet_body.html |date=2006-09-06 }}, 2000 ([http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf also in PDF file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025063501/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/vol5/09iftibet.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }})&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to other states such as the [[Kingdom of Dali]] and the [[Tangut Empire]] that were also incorporated into China at the time.

The PRC contends that, according to [[international law]] and the [[Succession of states theory]],&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of the "Succession of states theory in international law", see West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2, The Gale Group, Inc., 2008 : "Succession occurs when one state ceases to exist or loses control over part of its territory, and another state comes into existence or assumes control over the territory lost by the first state. A central concern in this instance is whether the international obligations of the former state are taken over by the succeeding state. Changes in the form of government of one state, such as the replacement of a monarchy by a democratic form of government, do not modify or terminate the obligations incurred by the previous government. When the state ceases to exist, however, the treaties it concluded generally are terminated and those of the successor state apply to the territory. These include political treaties like alliances, which depend on the existence of the state that concluded them. But certain obligations, such as agreements concerning boundaries or other matters of local significance, carry over to the successor state. More difficult to determine is the continuing legality of treaties granting concessions or contract rights. Scholarly opinion has diverged on this aspect of succession, and state practice has likewise divided. Consequently each case must be studied on its merits to determine whether the rights and duties under the contract or concession are such that the successor state is bound by the obligations of the previous state."&lt;/ref&gt; all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet, with the PRC having succeeded the ROC as the legitimate government of all China.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Kamm, [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Kamm%20Rene.pdf?oberlin1340040517 The Sino-Tibetan Dialogue: Talk Shop or Path to Resolution?], Marc Blecher, advisor, Oberlin College, East Asian Studies Honors, 2012 April 26, p. 7: "The PRC contends that, according to international law and the succession of states theory, all subsequent Chinese governments have succeeded the Yuan Dynasty in exercising de jure sovereignty over Tibet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Parker, Department of Political Science, Sierra College Truckee, California, [http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2012/Parker.pdf All (Geo-)Politics are Local: the Consequences of the People's Republic of China's Military Doctrine of Local War for the East Asia Region], Paper submitted for presentation at the Canadian Political Science Association annual meeting, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, June 12–15, 2012 : "In the view of its leadership, the PRC replaced the ROC as the legitimate government of all China under the succession of states theory of international law. That the majority of the world's states agree reinforces this assertion and serves to isolate the Taipei regime".&lt;/ref&gt;

===De facto independence===
The ROC government had no effective control over Tibet from 1912 to 1951;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Running From Tenda Gyamar: A Voluteer's Story of Life with the Refugee Children of Tibet|last=Freeman|first=Lesley|publisher=Mantra Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1-78099-853-4|location=Winchester, UK|pages=5|quote="With the collapse of the Chinese Empire in 1911, Tibet Declared its independence."}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the opinion of the Chinese government, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed ''de facto'' independence when the Chinese nation was torn by [[warlord era|warlordism]], [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]], and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p256&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein explains what is meant by ''de facto'' independence in the following statement:

{{quote|...[Britain] instead adopted a policy based on the idea of ''autonomy'' for Tibet within the context of Chinese ''suzerainty'', that is to say, ''de facto'' independence for Tibet in the context of token subordination to China.

We shall, therefore, be grateful if all the Governments concerned on his route would kindly give due recognition as such, grant necessary passport, visa, etc. without any hindrance and render assistance in all possible ways to him.''"

The passport has received visas and entry stamps from several countries and territories, including India, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iraq and Hong Kong, but not China. Some visa do reflect an official status, with mentions such as "Diplomatic courtesy, Service visa, Official gratis, Diplomatic visa, For government official".

However, acceptance of a passport does not indicate recognition of independence, as for example the [[Republic of China passport]] is accepted by almost all the countries of the world, even though few of them recognize the ROC as independent.

=== Tibet Government in exile (post 1959) ===
{{See also|Central Tibetan Administration}}

In 1959, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]] fled Tibet and established a [[Government of Tibet in Exile|government in exile]] at [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in northern [[India]]. This group claims sovereignty over various ethnically or historically Tibetan areas now governed by China. Aside from the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], an area that was administered directly by the Dalai Lama's government until 1951, the group also claims [[Amdo]] ([[Qinghai]]) and eastern [[Kham]] (western [[Sichuan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon'', University of California Press, 1997, p71&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 percent of ethnic Tibetans under Chinese rule live in the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to the 2000 census. Prior to 1949, much of Amdo and eastern Kham were governed by local rulers and even warlords.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The view of the current Dalai Lama in 1989 was as follows:

{{quote|During the 5th Dalai Lama's time [1617–1682], I think it was quite evident that we were a separate sovereign nation with no problems. The 6th Dalai Lama [1683–1706] was spiritually pre-eminent, but politically, he was weak and uninterested. He could not follow the 5th Dalai Lama's path. This was a great failure. So, then the Chinese influence increased. During this time, the Tibetans showed quite a deal of respect to the Chinese. But even during these times, the Tibetans never regarded Tibet as a part of China. All the documents were very clear that China, Mongolia and Tibet were all separate countries. Because the Chinese emperor was powerful and influential, the small nations accepted the Chinese power or influence. You cannot use the previous invasion as evidence that Tibet belongs to China. In the Tibetan mind, regardless of who was in power, whether it was the Manchus [the Qing dynasty], the Mongols [the Yuan dynasty] or the Chinese, the east of Tibet was simply referred to as China. In the Tibetan mind, India and China were treated the same; two separate countries.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin, 14th Dalai Lama. ''Tibet, China and the World: A Compilation of Interviews'', Dharamsala, 1989, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] concluded that from 1913 to 1950 Tibet demonstrated the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law. In the opinion of the commission, the government of Tibet conducted its own domestic and foreign affairs free from any outside authority, and countries with whom Tibet had foreign relations are shown by official documents to have treated Tibet in practice as an independent State.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Inquiry Committee, ''Tibet and Chinese People's Republic'', Geneva: International Commission of Jurists, 1960, pp. 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, [http://tibet.dharmakara.net/tibethistory.html ''The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law''], (Westview, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government in Exile views current PRC rule in Tibet, including neighboring provinces outside Tibet Autonomous Region, as colonial and illegitimate, motivated solely by the natural resources and strategic value of Tibet, and in gross violation of both Tibet's historical status as an independent country and the right of Tibetan people to [[self-determination]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} It also points to PRC's autocratic policies, [[divide and rule|divide-and-rule]] policies, and what it contends are assimilationist policies, and regard those as an example of ongoing [[imperialism]] aimed at destroying Tibet's distinct ethnic makeup, culture, and identity, thereby cementing it as an indivisible part of China.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} That said, the Dalai Lama stated in 2008 that he wishes only for Tibetan autonomy, and not separation from China, under certain conditions, like freedom of speech and expression, genuine self-rule, and control over ethnic makeup and migration in all areas claimed as historical Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24097313/ns/us_news-faith/t/tibetans-just-want-autonomy-dalai-lama-says/|title=Tibetans just want autonomy, Dalai Lama says|publisher=MSNBC|date=13 April 2008|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars outside of China say that [[Tibet during the Ming dynasty|during]] the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), Tibet was independent without even nominal Ming suzerainty. In contrast, since the mid-18th century it is agreed that China had control over Tibet reaching its maximum in the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, J., Foster, J.R. &amp; Hartman C., ''A History of Chinese Civilization'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, p481 reads in part: "''From 1751 onwards Chinese control over Tibet became permanent and remained so more or less ever after, in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the twentieth century.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Petech]], a scholar of Himalayan history, indicated that Tibet was a Qing protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Petech L.,''China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet'', 1972, p260&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[patron and priest relationship]] held between the Qing court and the Tibetan lamas has been subjected to varying interpretation. The 13th Dalai Lama, for example, knelt, but did not kowtow, before the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and the young Emperor while he delivered his petition in Beijing.  Chinese sources emphasize the submission of kneeling; Tibetan sources emphasize the lack of the kowtow.  Titles and commands given to Tibetans by the Chinese, likewise, are variously interpreted. The Qing authorities gave the 13th Dalai Lama the title of "Loyally Submissive Vice-Regent", and ordered to follow Qing's commands and communicate with the Emperor only through the Manchu Amban in [[Lhasa]]; but opinions vary as to whether these titles and commands reflected actual political power, or symbolic gestures ignored by Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |title=A wall painting showing the 13th Dalai Lama kneeling before the Dowager Queen |access-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425201257/http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/13th.html |archive-date=2001-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors claim that kneeling before the Emperor followed the 17th-century precedent in the case of the [[5th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, A. Tom, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', p. 42, reads in part "''Both'' (Tibetan and Chinese)'' accounts agree that the Dalai Lama was exempt from the traditional kowtow symbolizing total subservience; he was, however, required to kneel before the emperor.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians indicate that the emperor treated the Dalai Lama as an equal&lt;ref&gt;Laird, Thomas.

Grove Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1827-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling was a compromise allowed by the Qing court for foreign representatives, Western and Tibetan alike, as both parties refused to perform the kowtow.

Tibetologist Melvyn C. Goldstein writes that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] formally acknowledged Chinese authority over Tibet in treaties of 1906 and 1907; and that the 1904 [[British expedition to Tibet|British invasion of Tibet]] stirred China into becoming  more directly involved in Tibetan affairs and working to integrate Tibet with "the rest of China."&lt;ref name="Goldstein art4"&gt;[http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/article/art4.html Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question by Melvyn C.

The status of Tibet after the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] ended the Qing dynasty is also a matter of debate. After the revolution, the Chinese Republic of five races, including Tibetans, was proclaimed. Western powers recognized the Chinese Republic, however the 13th Dalai Lama proclaimed Tibet's independence. Some authors indicate that personal allegiance of the Dalai Lama to the Manchu Emperor came to an end and no new type of allegiance of Tibet to China was established,&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrowicz-Alexander C.H. The Legal Position of Tibet. - The American Journal of International Law, vol. 48, No. 2, 1954, pp. 265-274.&lt;/ref&gt; or that Tibet had relationships with the empire and not with the new nation-state of China.&lt;ref&gt;Dulaney, A.G., Cusack, D.M., and Van Walt van Praag, M., 1998.

=== Genocide allegations ===

Groups such as the Madrid-based [[Committee to Support Tibet]] claim the death toll in Tibet since the 1950 People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet to be 1,200,000 and have filed official charges of genocide against prominent Chinese leaders and officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-rejects-spains-genocide-claims-481351.html ''China rejects Spain's 'genocide' claims'']&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has been disputed by Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html ''He May Be a God, but He's No Politician'' By PATRICK FRENCH]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Tibet: Politics, Development, and Society in a Disputed Region'' by Barry Sautman and June Teufel Dreyer, New York: M.E.Sharpe (2006),p12&lt;/ref&gt; but rather, concludes a no less devastating death toll of half a million people as a direct result of Chinese policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/29/67/TIBET-TIBET-A-PERSONAL-HISTORY-OF-A-LOST-LAND/] ''TIBET, TIBET, A PERSONAL HISTORY OF A LOST LAND'' ''Nov 17, 2008 Category: Book Reviews''&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRC argues that the Tibetan authority under successive Dalai Lamas was also itself a [[Human rights#Human rights violations|human rights violator]]. The old society, the Chinese government and its supporters say, was a [[serfdom]] and, according to reports of an early English explorer, had remnants of "a very mild form of [[slavery]]" prior to the 13th Dalai Lama's reforms of 1913.&lt;ref name=hr&gt;For existence of serfdom and slaves, see Grunfeld, 1996, pp12-17 and Bell, Charles, 1927, pp78-79; for other forms of human rights violation, see [[Frank Bessac|Bessac, Frank]], "''This Was the Perilous Trek to Tragedy''", ''Life'', 13 Nov 1950, pp130-136, 198, 141; Ford, Robert W., "''Wind Between The Worlds''", New York, 1957, p37; MacDonald, David, "''The Land of the Lamas''", London, 1929, pp196-197&lt;/ref&gt;

Clergy obstructed modernization attempts by the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name=leh&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Robert Barnett in [[Steve Lehman (photographer)|Steve Lehman]], ''[[The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive]]'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.12], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1884167365]&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Tibet had a long history of persecuting non-Buddhist Christians.  In the years 1630 and 1742, Tibetan Christian communities were suppressed by the lamas of the Gelugpa Sect, whose chief lama was the Dalai Lama.  Jesuit priests were made prisoners in 1630 or attacked before they reached [[Tsaparang]].  Between 1850 and 1880, eleven fathers of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were murdered in Tibet, or killed or injured during their journeys to other missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881 Father Brieux was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. Qing officials later discovered that the murder cases were in fact covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and their patrons—the native chieftains. In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet'' by Hsiao-ting Lin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095547/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet'' By Alex McKay (ed), London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003) p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned&lt;/ref&gt;

Three UN resolutions of 1959, 1961, and 1965 condemned human rights violation in Tibet. These resolutions were passed at a time when the PRC was not [[China and the United Nations|permitted to become a member]] and of course was not allowed to present its singular version of events in the region (however, the Republic of China on Taiwan, which the PRC also tries to claim sovereignty over, was a member of the UN at the time, and it equally claimed sovereignty over Tibet and opposed Tibetan self-determination). Professor and sinologist [[A. Tom Grunfeld]] called the resolutions impractical and justified the PRC in ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;Grunfeld, 1996, p180&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunfeld questioned Human Rights Watch reports on human rights abuses in Tibet, saying they distorted the big picture.&lt;ref name=Gru&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |title=''Reassessing Tibet Policy'' by Tom Gunfeld |access-date=2008-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224030617/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/2821 |archive-date=2008-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barnett, since Western powers and especially the United States used the Tibet issue in the 1950s and 1960s for cold war political purposes, the PRC is now able to get support from developing countries in defeating the last nine attempts at the United Nations to criticize China.  Barnett writes that the position of the Chinese in Tibet would be more accurately characterized as a colonial occupation, and that such an approach might cause developing nations to be more supportive of the Tibetan cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government ignores the issue of its alleged violations of Tibetan human rights, and prefers to argue that the invasion was about territorial integrity and unity of the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/12/content_6612118.htm Retrieved on 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Tibetan activists inside Tibet have until recently focused on independence, not human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/documents/LEHMN2b.pdf Passages extracted by Robert Barnett from Steve Lehman, ''The Tibetans: Struggle to Survive'', Umbrage Editions, New York, 1998. pdf p.13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]] which claims 30,000 over members &lt;ref name=chi&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/11/content_6608921.htm '''[[Tibetan Youth Congress]]' is pure terrorist organization'' Retrieved on 13 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; are alleged by China to advocate violence.  In 1998, Barnett wrote that India's military includes 10,000 Tibetans, causing China some unease; and that "at least seven bombs exploded in Tibet between 1995 and 1997, one of them laid by a monk, and a significant number of individual Tibetans are known to be actively seeking the taking up of arms; hundreds of Chinese soldiers and police have been beaten during demonstrations in Tibet, and at least one killed in cold blood, probably several more."&lt;ref name=leh/&gt;

Chinadaily.com reported on the discovery of weapons subsequent to the protests by peaceful Buddhists monks on March 14, 2008: "Police in Lhasa seized more than 100 guns, tens of thousands of bullets, several thousand kilograms of explosives and tens of thousands of detonators, acting on reports from lamas and ordinary people."&lt;ref name=chi/&gt;

And on 23 March 2008, there was a bombing incident in the Qambo prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/12/content_7966393.htm''Police crack bombing at Tibetan township government building'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-determination ===
While the earliest ROC constitutional documents already claim Tibet as part of China, Chinese political leaders also acknowledged the principle of [[self-determination]]. For example, at a party conference in 1924, [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] issued a statement calling for the right of self-determination of all Chinese ethnic groups: "''The Kuomintang can state with solemnity that it recognizes the right of self-determination of all national minorities in China and it will organize a free and united Chinese republic.''"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ''National and Minority Policies, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science: Report of China 277'', 1951, pp148-149&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] issued a [[constitution]] for the short-lived [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] which states that Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, "may either join the Union of Chinese Soviets or secede from it."&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, C., Schwartz, B. and Fairbank, John K. (ed.), ''A Documentary History of Chinese Communism'', 1960, pp223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revo"&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv2n1/aiprf.htm "Report on the International Seminar on the Nationality Question"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that China was in a state of civil war at the time and that the "Chinese Soviets" only represents a faction. Saying that Tibet may secede from the "Chinese Soviets" does not mean that it can secede from China. The quote above is merely a statement of Tibetans' freedom to choose their political orientation. The possibility of complete secession was denied by Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] in 1938: "They must have the right to self-determination and at the same time they should continue to unite with the Chinese people to form one nation".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; This policy was codified in [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|PRC's first constitution]] which, in Article 3, reaffirmed China as a "''single'' [[multi-national state]]," while the "national ''autonomous areas'' are inalienable parts".&lt;ref name="revo"/&gt; The Chinese government insists that the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples|documents]], which codifies the principle of self-determination, provides that the principle shall not be abused in disrupting [[territorial integrity]]: "Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:UN General Assembly Resolution 1514|United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legitimacy ===
The PRC also points to what it claims are the [[autocracy|autocratic]], [[oppression|oppressive]] and [[theocracy|theocratic]] policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, its toleration of existence of serfdom and slaves,&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; its so-called "renunciation" of ([[Arunachal Pradesh]]) and its association with India and other foreign countries, and as such claims the Government of Tibet in Exile has no legitimacy to govern Tibet and no [[credibility]] or justification in criticizing PRC's policies.

China claims that the People's Liberation Army's march into Tibet in 1951 was "not without the support of a handful of Tibetan people", including the 10th [[Panchen Lama]]. [[Ian Buruma]] writes:

{{quote|...It is often forgotten that many Tibetans, especially educated people in the larger towns, were so keen to modernize their society in the mid-20th century that they saw the Chinese communists as allies against rule by monks and serf-owning landlords. The Dalai Lama himself, in the early 1950s, was impressed by Chinese reforms and wrote poems praising Chairman Mao.&lt;ref name=Buruma /&gt;}}

Instances have been documented when the PRC government gained support from a portion of the Tibetan population, including monastic leaders,&lt;ref name=mgoldstein&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., "''A history of modern Tibet''", pp683-687&lt;/ref&gt; monks,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, R. W., "''Wind between the Worlds''", p178, saying: ' ''There was no sacking of monasteries at this time. On the contrary, the Chinese took great care not to cause offense through ignorance. They soon had the monks thanking the gods for their deliverance.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; nobility&lt;ref name=grufeld115&gt;Grunfeld, A.T., "''The Making of Modern Tibet''", p115, saying: ' ''By most accounts there were some Tibetans who were pleased to see the Han in Tibet. Peter Aufschneiter told British diplomats in Kathmandu that ordinary Tibetans liked the Han because they were honest and they distributed land. Among the younger generation of the nobility it was seen as an opportunity to make some positive changes.'' '&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATGrunfeld&gt;Grunfeld, A.T., "''The Making of Modern Tibet''", M. E. Sharpe, 1996, p127, saying ' ''When the communists first arrived in Lhasa, only a few of the aristocracy joined them enthusiastically. In Kham, however, the upper classes welcomed them as potential liberators from the strongly disliked Lhasan officials.'' '&lt;/ref&gt; and ordinary Tibetans&lt;ref name=grufeld115/&gt; prior to the crackdown in the 1959 uprising. The PRC government and some Tibetan leaders&lt;ref name=mgoldstein/&gt; characterize PLA's operation as a peaceful liberation of Tibetans from a "feudal serfdom system." ({{lang|zh|和平解放西藏}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/minorities/Tibetan.html |title=The Tibetan ethnic minority |publisher=[[People's Daily]] English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/20010719/431559.htm]." ''Full Text of Speech By Chinese President Hu Jintao at Tibet's Peaceful Liberation Anniversary Rally&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tibet complained to the United Nations through [[El Salvador]] about Chinese invasion in November 1950—after China captured [[Chamdo]] (or Qamdo) when Tibet failed to respond by the deadline to China's demand for negotiation--&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987732.htm ''Tell you a true Tibet -- Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; members debated about it but refused to admit the "Tibet Question" into the agenda of the U.N. General Assembly. Key stakeholder India told the General Assembly that "the [[Peking]] Government had declared that it had not abandoned its intention to settle the difficulties by peaceful means", and that "the Indian Government ''was certain'' that the Tibet Question could still be settled by peaceful means".  The Russian delegate said that "China's sovereignty over Tibet had been recognized for a long time by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the U.S.S.R." The United Nations postponed this matter on the pretext Tibet was officially an "autonomous nationality region belonging to territorial China", and because the outlook of peaceful settlement seemed good.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn C. Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p676-9,699,729-735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn C. Goldstein, ''The Snow Lion and the Dragon: China, Tibet, and the Dalai Lama'' Berkeley:University of California Press, (1999), p41; cited by Yuliya Babayeva in the article [http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honorscollege_theses'' The Khampa Uprising: Tibetan Resistance Against the Chinese Invasion''] pdf p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, ''The Agreement Between the Central Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Method for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'', also known as [[Seventeen Point Agreement|Seventeen-Point Agreement]], was signed between delegates of China and Tibet on 23 May 1951. The Dalai Lama,despite the massive Chinese military presence, had ample time and opportunity to repudiate and denounce the Seventeen-Point Agreement. He was encouraged and instigated to do so with promise of public but not military support by the US, which by now had become hostile to Communist-ruled China.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' by Melvyn Goldstein, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press(1989), p761-769,784-812&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, the 10th Panchen Erdeni (i.e. 10th Panchen Lama) and the Panchen Kampus Assembly made a formal statement, expressing their heartfelt support for the agreement. The statement indicated their resolution to guarantee the correct implementation of the agreement and to realize solidarity between the different ethnic groups of China and ethnic solidarity among the Tibetans; and on May 30, the 10th Panchen Erdeni telegrammed the 14th Dalai Lama, expressing his hope for unity and his vow to support the 14th Dalai Lama and the government of Tibet with the implementation of the agreement under the guidance of the Central Government and Chairman Mao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-04/16/content_7987757.htm ''Signing of the Agreement on Methods for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 25 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agreement was finally accepted by Tibet's National Assembly, which then advised the Dalai Lama to accept it. Finally, on 24 October 1951, the Dalai Lama dispatched a telegram to [[Mao Zedong]]:

{{quote|The Tibet Local Government as well as the ecclesiastic and secular People unanimously support this agreement, and under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] and the Central People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to consolidate defence, drive out imperialist influences from Tibet and safeguard the unification of the territory and sovereignty of the Motherland.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.603&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 28 October 1951, the Panchen Rinpoche [i.e. [[Panchen Lama]]] made a similar public statement accepting the agreement. He urged the "people of [[Shigatse]] to give active support" to carrying out the agreement.&lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"&gt;''The History of Tibet: Volume III The Modern Period: 1895-1959'' edited by Alex McKay, London and New York: Routledge Curzon (2003), p.604&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsering Shakya writes about the general acceptance of the Tibetans toward the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and its legal significance:

{{quote|The most vocal supporters of the agreement came from the monastic community...As a result many Tibetans were willing to accept the agreement....Finally there were strong factions in Tibet who felt that the agreement was acceptable...this section was led by the religious community...In the Tibetans' view their independence was not a question of international legal status, but as Dawa Norbu  writes, "Our sense of independence was based on the independence of our way of life and culture, which was more real to the unlettered masses than law or history, canons by which the non-Tibetans decide the fate of Tibet...This was the first formal agreement between Tibet and Communist China and it established the legal basis for Chinese rule in Tibet." &lt;ref name="Tibet 2003 p.604"/&gt;}}

On March 28, 1959, premier Zhou Enlai signed the order of the PRC State Council on the uprising in Tibet, falsely accusing the Tibetan government of disrupting the Agreement. (see,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savetibet.ru/2010/03/10/tibet_book.html Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala: LTWA, p. 239-240]&lt;/ref&gt; for review). The creation of the TAR finally buried the Agreement that was discarded back in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Shakya, Ts. 1999. The Dragon in the Land of Snows. A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947. London: Pimlico, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1959, the Dalai Lama published a statement in Tezpur, India, that gave his reasons for escaping to India. He pointed out that the 17 Point Agreement was signed under compulsion; later the Chinese side permanently violated it. According to Michael Van Walt Van Praag, "treaties and similar agreements concluded under the use or threat of force are invalid under international law ab initio".&lt;ref&gt;Walt Van Praag, Michael C. van, The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law. Westview, 1987, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this Agreement is not considered legal by those who consider Tibet to have been an independent state before its signing; but it is considered legal by those who oppose Tibet's independence. In either case the PRC did not abide by the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein, Matthew T. 2006. The Tibetans. London: Blackwell, pp. 280-290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Commission of Jurists, The Question of Tibet and the Rule of Law. Feb. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''timeline of voting rights in the United States'''.

==Timeline==
* '''1789: '''grants the states the power to set voting requirements. Generally, states limited this right to property-owning or tax-paying white males (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1790:''' The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] allows white men born outside of the United States to become citizens. However, due to the Constitution granting the states the power to set voting requirements, this Act (and its successor Act of 1795) did not automatically grant the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~kdhist/H105-documents-web/week08/naturalization1790.html|title=naturalization laws 1790-1795|website=www.indiana.edu|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1792–1838:''' Free black males lose the right to vote in several Northern states including [[1838 Pennsylvania Loss of Voting Rights for African American Men|in Pennsylvania]] and [[History of the New Jersey State Constitution#Vote Rescinded for Women.2C non-Whites|in New Jersey]].
* '''1792–1856:''' Abolition of property qualifications for white men, from 1792 (Kentucky) to 1856 (North Carolina) during the periods of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]].&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L. Engerman, University of Rochester and NBER|author2=Kenneth L. Sokoloff, University of California, Los Angeles and NBER|title=The Evolution of Suffrage Institutions in the New World|date=February 2005|url=http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Economic-History/sokoloff-050406.pdf|pages=16, 35|quote=By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]], there were 108,359 ballots cast. Most older states with property restrictions dropped them by the mid-1820s, except for Rhode Island, Virginia and North Carolina. No new states had property qualifications although three had adopted tax-paying qualifications – Ohio, Louisiana, and Mississippi, of which only in Louisiana were these significant and long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timeline of voting rights in the United States#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828 presidential election]] was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Timeline of voting rights in the United States#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14. "Property- or tax-based qualifications were most strongly entrenched in the original thirteen states, and dramatic political battles took place at a series of prominent state constitutional conventions held during the late 1810s and 1820s."&lt;/ref&gt;
**Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult white male population in the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;William G. Shade, "The Second Party System". in Paul Kleppner, et al. ''Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983) pp 77-111&lt;/ref&gt; 2,412,694 ballots were cast, an increase that far outstripped natural population growth, making poor voters a huge part of the electorate. There were few nations in the world that had a similar level of suffrage for white males at this time. The process was peaceful and widely supported, except in the state of Rhode Island where the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for anyone resident but born outside of the United States. 
**The last state to abolish property qualification was North Carolina in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal white male suffrage]]. However, tax-paying qualifications remained in five states in 1860 – Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina. They survived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 16 and 35. Table 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many poor whites were later disenfranchised. 
* '''1868:''' Citizenship is guaranteed to all male persons born or naturalized in the United States by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], setting the stage for future expansions to voting rights.
* '''1870:''' The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prevents states from denying the right to vote on grounds of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".
** [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era]] began soon after. Former Confederate states passed [[Jim Crow laws]] and amendments to effectively [[disfranchise]] black and poor white voters through [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]es, [[literacy tests]], [[grandfather clauses]] and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of African Americans lived in the South.
* '''1887:''' Citizenship is granted to Native Americans who are willing to disassociate themselves from their tribe by the [[Dawes Act]], making them technically eligible to vote.
* '''1913:''' Direct election of [[United States Senate|Senators]], established by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], gave voters rather than state legislatures the right to elect senators.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/Section/AP-Test-Prep-The-Expansion-of-Suffrage.id-305363%2CarticleId-58202.html |title=AP Tests: AP Test Prep: The Expansion of Suffrage |work=[[CliffsNotes]] |date=10 January 2010 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110231456/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/Section/AP-Test-Prep-The-Expansion-of-Suffrage.id-305363%2CarticleId-58202.html |archivedate=10 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1920:''' Women are guaranteed the right to vote by the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In practice, the same restrictions that hindered the ability of non-white men to vote now also applied to non-white women.
* '''1924:''' All Native Americans are granted citizenship and the right to vote, regardless of tribal affiliation. By this point, approximately two thirds of Native Americans were already citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Madsen|editor1-first=Deborah L.|title=The Routledge Companion to Native American Literature|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-317-69319-1|page=168|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-AapCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Winterval''' was a season of public events in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], organised by [[Birmingham City Council]] in each of two consecutive [[winter]]s: first from 20 November to 31 December 1997,&lt;ref name="bcc1997"&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971210073015/http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |url=http://birmingham.gov.uk/winterval/index.html |archivedate=10 December 1997 |accessdate=21 October 2009 |date=19 November 1997 |title=Winterval 1997 |publisher=Birmingham City Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again from mid-October 1998 to mid-January 1999. The intention was to encourage people into the newly rejuvenated city centre,&lt;ref name="guar2006"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities |title=The phoney war on Christmas |first=Oliver |last=Burkeman |work=The Guardian |date=8 December 2006 |location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with [[secular]] and [[religion|religious]] events marking religious and other occasions during the relevant period. The name "Winterval" has since become used in the UK as shorthand for what are presented as attempts to  "[[Rebranding|rebrand]]" Christmas so as not to exclude non-[[Christian]]s.

== 1997 ==
The name "Winterval" was a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[winter]]'' and ''[[festival]]'', coined by the Council's Head of Events, Mike Chubb.&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/winterval-the-truth/ |title=Winterval – the truth |publisher=Pigsonthewing.org.uk |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 he explained:&lt;ref name="pigsonthewing"/&gt;

{{quote|Quite simply, as head of events at that time, we needed a vehicle which could cover the marketing of a whole season of events... [[Diwali]] (the Festival of Lights), Christmas Lights switch-on, [[BBC]] [[Children in Need]], [[Aston Hall]] by Candlelight, [[Chinese New Year]], [[New Year's Eve]], etc. Also, a season that included theatre shows, an open-air [[ice-rink]], the Frankfurt Open-air Christmas Market and the Christmas seasonal retail offer. Christmas—called Christmas!—and its celebration lay at the heart of Winterval.

[[Political correctness]] was never the reasoning behind Winterval, but yes, it was intended to be inclusive—which is no bad thing to my mind—and a brand to which other initiatives could be developed as part of the Winterval offer, in order to sell the city at a time when all cities are competing against each other for the seasonal trade.}}

The programme of events in 1997 included theatre and arts events; marking of [[Diwali]]; candlelit tours of [[Aston Hall]]; an outdoor [[ice rink]]; a German-style [[Christmas market]]; [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] in the streets;  and a [[New Year's Eve]] Party.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; The front cover of the promotional brochure used the word "Christmas" three times&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; and featured a photograph of the City's official [[Christmas tree]].&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt; Each of its six pages featured the word "Christmas" in text or images.&lt;ref name="bcc1997"/&gt;

== 1998 ==

The extended Winterval the following year included: [[Hallowe'en]]; [[Guy Fawkes Night]]; [[Diwali]]; [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]; [[Hanukkah]]; [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]; [[New Year's Eve]]; and [[Chinese New Year]].

Posters were displayed, advertising Christmas events, with the word "Christmas" in large type, and the "Winterval 98" logo only as a footnote.&lt;ref name="Pickles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2010/11/30/local-government-secretary-eric-pickles-attacks-1998-s-winterval-65233-27738640/|title=Local Government secretary Eric Pickles attacks 1998's Winterval|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=2010-11-30|publisher=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church of England]] leaders in Birmingham criticised the 1998 "Winterval" concept. [[Mark Santer]], then [[Bishop of Birmingham]], said in a message to his parishes that he "laughed out loud" when he learned of the concept of Winterval, which he considered to be "a way of not talking about Christmas" and "a well-meaning attempt not to offend". He wondered whether Christianity had been censored.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Winterval gets frosty reception |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Archdeacon]] of [[Aston]] called it "a totally unnecessary example of political correctness to avoid sensitivities people simply do not have".&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; The council responded that "Christmas is the very heart of Winterval", saying that Christmas-themed events were prominent among those included in Winterval, and that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"/&gt; While the Winterval season was longer than the Christmas season, Christmas was the focus of the relevant portion of Winterval, and a statement from Birmingham Council explained:&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

{{quote|...there was a banner saying Merry Christmas across the front of the council house, Christmas lights, Christmas trees in the main civil squares, regular carol-singing sessions by school choirs, and the Lord Mayor sent a Christmas card with a traditional Christmas scene wishing everyone a Merry Christmas.}}

Neighbouring [[Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council|Solihull council]] invited Birmingham residents desiring a traditional Christmas to go there instead.&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Birmingham City Council did not use the name "Winterval" after the 1998–9 season,&lt;ref name="guar2006"/&gt; but it persists as shorthand for any secular replacement for Christmas, used both by supporters&lt;ref&gt;

The "Winterval" trope was also debunked by [[Stephen Fry]], in a 2007 episode of the quiz-show ''[[QI]]''.&lt;ref name= ""&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Empire |series=QI  |serieslink=QI |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRlZvn-KiH4 |accessdate=7 October 2017 |network= [[BBC Television]] |date= 7 December 2007  |season=E |number=12 |transcript=  |transcripturl=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
