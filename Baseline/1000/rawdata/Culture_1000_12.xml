      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4410">The '''Afo-A-Kom''' is a wooden sculpture, the foremost symbol of the [[Kom people (Cameroon)|Kom people]] of the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|North West Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. In 1966 it was stolen from Kom's royal compound. Seven years later it was recognized in a U.S. art gallery, and after some dispute, it was returned to the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afo-A-Kom, which means ''the Kom thing'' (also ''Mbang'' in the [[Kom language]]) is a 62.5 inch wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is [[iroko]] wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The [[Fon (title)|Foyn/Fon]] (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes "royal authority and the promise of continued succession."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1966, the Afo-A-Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at [[Laikom]] (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A-Kom.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector [[Warren M. Robbins]] raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other Americans&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and some Kom elite in the US{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]], among other dignitaries.

During the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. However, it was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and later on transported by air to [[Bamenda]]. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Abang Njuosi.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">The '''Alliance for International Exchange''' (formerly Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange" is an association of non-governmental [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs|exchange programs]] in the [[United States]].  The Alliance was founded in 1993 following the merger of the International Exchange Association and the Liaison Group for International Educational Exchange.  Following this merger, the Alliance became the sole collective voice of the 76 [[non-governmental organization]] exchange programs for the purpose of developing a unified public policy voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Alliance|url=http://www.alliance-exchange.org/about-alliance|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guiding principles ==
The Alliance's stated mission is "to formulate and promote public policies that support the growth and well being of international exchange links between the people of the United States and other nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Alliance|url=http://www.alliance-exchange.org/about-alliance|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alliance operates under five guiding principles:
* The experience and relationships gained through international exchange are essential to furthering global peace, freedom, mutual understanding, international cooperation, economic prosperity, and the growth of human knowledge;
* International exchange enhances the effectiveness of the United States in dealing with other nations by building the global competencies of U.S. citizens and others skills increasingly important in the world of the 21st century;
* Participating in an international exchange program contributes fundamentally to a person's intellectual development;
* The conduct of the international exchange program must embody the highest standards of quality, integrity, and professionalism, and must offer the fullest possible equality of opportunity; and
* The international exchange community in the United States has a responsibility to advocate public policies needed to sustain and strengthen international linkages with other countries through educational and cultural exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Alliance|url=http://www.alliance-exchange.org/about-alliance|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance produces specific recommendations for public policy makers concerning the exchange organizations that it represents.  Further, it provides an opportunity for the leaders of the various exchange organizations to come together and exchange ideas or concerns.  One of the core organizational activities of the Alliance is the spreading of public awareness of the role of exchange programs in meeting real demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Alliance|url=http://www.alliance-exchange.org/about-alliance|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== View on exchange programs ==
The Alliance has four stated views on the role that exchange programs play in international relations.  First, the Alliance believes that participants who engage in exchange programs and those who encounter exchange program participants experience a change in understanding of other cultures.  Secondly, these types of exchanges allow for participants and others to grow and to develop new or refined skills.  The third role is economic as people brought to the United States necessarily expend money and benefit local economies.  The final role that the Alliance states is integral to exchange programs is in leadership training.  The Alliance believes that exchange programs advance leadership skills that may be used in the future in finding solutions to the critical problems facing the United States, domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Alliance|url=http://www.alliance-exchange.org/about-alliance|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''American Institute for Foreign Study,''' (AIFS) is an American travel and insurance company, managing a number of educational and travel programs centered on cultural exchange founded or acquired by British businessman and politician Sir [[Cyril Julian Hebden Taylor]] starting in 1964. Its operations include college study abroad, ''[[au pair]]'' placement, camp counsellors and staff, gifted education, and high school foreign exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4259373   American Institute for Foreign Study, Inc] Bloomberg.com&lt;/ref&gt; AIFS maintains global offices in 15 countries.

AIFS is a privately owned U.S. company with wholly owned subsidiaries around the world and has annual revenues in excess of $180 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoovers.com/american-institute-for-foreign-study/--ID__121203--/free-co-profile.xhtml  American Institute for Foreign Study, Inc] Hoovers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
In 1964, Cyril Taylor and his partners left [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] to form the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS).  With the assistance of   the late Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1967, AIFS created the AIFS Foundation, which awards grants and scholarships to students for participation in study abroad programs and provides grants to high schools and other institutions for the purpose of international and educational travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aifsfoundation.org/mission.htm AIFS Foundation Mission Statement] aifsfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt; The AIFS Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) tax exempt public charity and a U.S. Department of State designated sponsor of the [[J-1 visa|J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa]]. In 1972, AIFS established [[Richmond, The American International University in London]], a non-profit university with 1,000 full-time students from 100 countries.

Sir Cyril continued to serve as AIFS Chairman and Chancellor of Richmond, the American International University in London, until his death at age 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmond.ac.uk/content/about-richmond/board-of-trustees.aspx/mission.htm  Richmond, the American International University in London] richmond.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Bundling''', or '''tarrying''', is the traditional practice of wrapping two people in a bed together, usually as a part of [[courting]] behavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the [[Netherlands]] or in the [[British Isles]] and later became common in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]],&lt;ref&gt;History of Sex, Love and Sexuality 1750 America and Bundling, The People's Almanac [http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-sex-love-sexuality-1750-america-and-bundling.htm 1975 - 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stiles | first=Henry Reed | year=2005 | title=Bundling: Its Origin, Progress and Decline | edition=reprint | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4179-8628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]. Some [[Nebraska Amish]] may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow [[intimacy]] without [[sexual intercourse]].

==Origin==
It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the [[Bible|biblical]] story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an older wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room while not touching; the pair later get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ruth.3:9-14;Ruth.4:13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship practice==
Traditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a ''bundling board'' or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.

== In United States ==
In [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial United States]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and other preachers condemned bundling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|title=Jonathan Edwards: A Life|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300129946|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGd_Ry34_MC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;ots=gv6GO_MWjE&amp;dq=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the practice continued into the period of the early Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were permitted to bundle with locals.  This seemingly strange practice allowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed.  Some hotels rented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a bed entailed an additional fee.

It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and perhaps in [[New England]], though its popularity was waning.  The court case of ''Graham v. Smith'', 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the [[Seduction (tort)|seduction]] of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative   [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] [[Subgroups of Amish|affiliations]], where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;Shachtman, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The writer [[Washington Irving]], in chapter 7 of ''[[Knickerbocker's History of New York]]'' as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the media==
Gabriel Edward Martin, [[Heath Ledger]]'s character in the 2000 film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', is bundled when he spends an overnight visit at the home of  Anne Patricia Howard ([[Lisa Brenner]]), the girl that he is courting.

[[Anna Gunn]]'s character in the HBO series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' mentions removing a bundling board from their bed in Season 2, Episode 2.

In the TV series [[Salem (TV series)|''Salem'']] during Season 1, Episode 7, "Our Own Private America", adolescent teens are seen bundling. The girl breaks the sack.

In the TV serie [[A Discovery of Witches (TV series)|A Discovery of Witches]] during Season 1, episode 5, Matthew de Clairmont and Diana Bishop discuss the "bundling" custom.

The Burnt Generation shaped their future dreams based on their parents' values and lifestyle. These values described success, convenience and social acceptance as simply achievable goals through hard work and right education. Their parents, a [[Baby boomer|Baby Boomer]]-like generation, had rebuilt the country after World War II, established public education and women’s rights, nationalized the oil industry, and enhanced the public health system. Although there was a growing dissatisfaction with the government and Shah’s approach to a variety of political and social issues, the public's assumption was that those issues would be resolved through a democratic system.

After the Shah's exile in the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]], the clash between various political groups and new government created a suspicious environment that deeply affected the beliefs and values of the Burnt Generation. They are marked by lack of optimism for the future, nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, political apathy, alienation and distrust in traditional values and institutions which describe the similarities between Gen X and the Burnt Generation.

Another important event that influenced this generation was the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution|Cultural Revolution]] and the shutting down colleges and universities for several years. After reopening, every applicant had to pass an interview with the government-approved committees and women were only allowed to apply for certain limited majors. At that time, many of Burnt Generation, ranged between 13 and 25 years old, were fighting in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], which lasted from 1980 to 1988 with a million casualties on both sides.

As a result of growing up in that environment, they either have strong religious beliefs or are completely distrustful of religion and God. Some believe in God but disconnect themselves from any religious beliefs or groups. Their most common values include loyalty to family and friends, compassion, and high work ethics. The uncertainties of their future, either for those who lived in Iran or elsewhere, leave a deep sense of insecurity in the Burnt Generation.

[[Danielle Hawkins]] soon launched a blog on Tumblr by the same name. Writing at ''[[The Root]]'', Diamond Sharp describes "carefree black girls" as an idea black women "have used...to anchor expressions of individuality and whimsy in the face of the heavy [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] and painful realities that too often color discussions of their demographic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Diamond|title=Why Carefree Black Girls Are Here to Stay|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/carefree_black_girls_how_the_hashtag_turned_into_a_movement/|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=The Root|date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Refinery29]]'', Jamala Johns said it was "a way to celebrate all things joyous and eclectic among brown ladies.

Around 1850, a British [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|merchant service]] captain, Charles Noble, upon discovering that the stack of his ship's galley was made of [[copper]], ordered that it be kept bright. From then onwards the ship's crew then started referring to the galley smokestack as the "'''Charlie Noble'''".

Due to significant [[Economic migrant|economic migration]] away from many of the small rural towns these events draw many generations to celebrate.

In 2000, there was a provincial "Come Home Year" in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] where many people came back to visit their various communities.

In 2005, [[Saskatchewan]] had a "Come Home Year" as part of the province's [[centennial]] celebration.

In 2017, [[McIvers]], Newfoundland hosted a Come Home event that temporarily tripled the town's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Gary|title='It's been just marvellous': McIvers Come Home Year is aces|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/mcivers-come-home-year-1.4224350|accessdate=28 July 2017|publisher=CBC News|date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}
A '''constitutional convention''' is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those [[Commonwealth of Nations]] states that follow the [[Westminster system]] and whose political systems derive from [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional law]], most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.
In these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the [[head of state]] that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the [[head of government]].

Some constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).

==Definitions==
The term was first used by British legal scholar [[A. V. Dicey]] in his 1883 book, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''. Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:

{{cquote|The one set of rules are in the strictest sense "laws", since they are rules which (whether written or unwritten, whether enacted by statute or derived from the mass of custom, tradition, or judge-made maxims {{sic|?|know}} as the common law) are enforced by the courts....

The other set of rules consist of conventions, understandings, habits, or practices that&amp;mdash;though they may regulate the conduct of the several members of the sovereign power, the Ministry, or other officials&amp;mdash;are not really laws, since they are not enforced by the courts. This portion of constitutional law may, for the sake of distinction, be termed the "conventions of the constitution", or constitutional morality.&lt;ref&gt;AV Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', 10th edition, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A century later, Canadian scholar [[Peter Hogg]] wrote,

{{cquote|Conventions are rules of the constitution which are not enforced by the law courts. Because they are not enforced by the law courts they are best regarded as non-legal rules, but because they do in fact regulate the working of the constitution they are an important concern of the constitutional lawyer. What conventions do is to prescribe the way in which legal powers shall be exercised. Some conventions have the effect of transferring effective power from the legal holder to another official or institution. Other conventions limit an apparently broad power, or even prescribe that a legal power shall not be exercised at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

Constitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of [[Robert Peel]] to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in [[First Peel ministry|1834&amp;ndash;1835]].

==Enforceability in the courts==

Constitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in its 1981 [[Patriation Reference]], is that, "They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, ''Attorney General of Manitoba et al. v. Attorney General of Canada et al.'' (September 28, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can "crystallize" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1982/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.

Some conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).

However, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said {{By whom|date=May 2016}} that "conventions are not worth the paper they are written on", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Examples==

===Australia===
* Whoever can command a majority in the House of Representatives is entitled to be asked by the Governor-General to form a government, and take the title Prime Minister.
* Governors-General always act on the advice of their Prime Minister or other relevant minister in regard to particular powers they may exercise.
* An incumbent Prime Minister who loses an election will advise the Governor-General to appoint the leader of the larger party as Prime Minister so the Governor-General does not need to act alone.
* State Premiers tender advice to State Governors for Federal Senate elections, in response to the Prime Minister's advice to the Governor-General to call a Federal House of Representatives election.
* State Governors are given a [[dormant commission]] to administer the Commonwealth if the Governor-General is unable to.
* Vice-regal officers act in a politically neutral way.

No convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]].

Ignoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010]], the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* The six members of the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that are chosen by the Parliaments of entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], should be chosen in a way as to establish the national balance, of "constituent peoples", in the Court (two [[Bosniaks]], two [[Croats|Croatian]]s and two [[Serb]]s), although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement.
* The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] should be of different nationality in every new term (establishing the "rotation"), although this is not formally regulated.
* The government of an [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] should inform the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|government of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] of its intention to establish special parallel relationships with neighboring states, including negotiations. Also, the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] should be notified of any such intent, especially if there is a document that should be signed between parties, although the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitution]] does not have this requirement (also for first example).

===Canada===
* Previously the Senate would not defeat a bill passed by the House of Commons, it was broken in 1989 when the Senate defeated a bill regulating abortions. It was broken again for a bill that would have ratified a [[free trade agreement]] between Canada and the United States.
* The Prime Minister will request the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] to call an election upon the defeat of the government in a confidence or money vote. This convention was broken in 1968 when the ruling [[minority government]] unexpectedly lost a money vote. All the parties in Parliament, who were not prepared for a snap election, agreed to pass a resolution retroactively declaring the lost money vote was not a matter of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGregor |first=Janyce |title=Feeling confident about the budget vote? |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=12 May 2013 |date=11 June 2012 |quote=In 1968, Lester Pearson was prime minister, presiding over a minority Liberal government. Pearson governed largely with the support of the NDP, but in February the Liberals unexpectedly lost a final Commons vote over an amendment to the Income Tax Act. A strict reading of parliamentary convention would have suggested that vote was enough to trigger an election, because the change constituted a "money bill." But the Liberals were in the process of selecting a new leader, and Pearson gambled that no one really wanted an election right away. Pearson went on television and told Canadians that his government would put a second vote before the House of Commons specifically asking whether or not his government continued to command the confidence of the House of Commons, rather than the merits or demerits of a tax change. His gamble worked: his party won the second, more specific vote and carried on governing. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417044908/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html |archivedate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Though it is mentioned in various constitutional documents, the precise nature of the office of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] operates mostly according to understood, uncodified British conventions.
* The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is, by statute (the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]''), composed of three justices from [[Quebec]] and six from anywhere in Canada (including Quebec).  This is because Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the common law system used elsewhere in Canada; it is necessary to have a panel of at least three judges to hear civil law cases.  By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate amongst themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.  The appointment of the most senior puisne justice to chief justice is a convention that has recently fallen into disuse. There is also an attempt to appoint at least one justice straight from legal practice without having previously been a judge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Commonwealth Realms===
* The [[Governor-General]] is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, is a resident of the country he or she will represent, and can be dismissed immediately on the advice of the Prime Minister (exceptions are [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], where the Governor-General is elected by Parliament and then formally appointed by the Queen, and the United Kingdom, which has no vice-regal office). However, in Canada, provincial lieutenant-governors are appointed on the advice of the federal prime minister, not the provincial premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=V.58| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=15 January 2009| ref=CITEREF_Victoria_1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will participate in the political process unless there is an extreme circumstance that merits the use of [[reserve powers]], or when the advice tendered is contrary to established convention.
* Neither the Monarch nor a Governor-General will make [[Partisan (political)|partisan speech]]es or state partisan opinions. This convention was broken in 1975 by [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], the [[Governor of Queensland]], who called for the defeat of the [[Whitlam Government]]. The Queen, on Whitlam's advice, revoked Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to act as [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] later refused the [[Premier of Queensland]]'s request that they advise the Queen to appoint Hannah to a second term as Governor (in 1975, Australian State Governors were still appointed on the advice of UK ministers)

===Denmark===
* The [[Danish Constitution]] makes reference to the King in great detail. Apart from the fact that this is understood to include a [[Queen regnant]] as well, references to the King acting in a political capacity are understood to mean the Prime Minister, as the Constitution stipulates that the King exercises his powers through the Cabinet.
* According to the Constitution, any public expenditure must be provided for in the annual [[money bill]] or provisional money bills. However, although not provided for in the Constitution, according to constitutional custom, the Parliamentary Budgetary Committee has the power to authorise provisional expenditure, regardless of the fact that such expenditure is not formally included in the budget (such grants are however then marked for adoption in the next forthcoming money bill).

===France===
* If the [[President of France|President]] of the Republic and the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] are [[Cohabitation (government)|not from the same party]], foreign affairs and defense are conducted by the President.
* If the president of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], the president of the [[French Senate|Senate]] or 60 deputies or 60 senators claim that a just-voted [[statute]] is unconstitutional, the President of the Republic does not sign the law and instead waits for a petition to be sent to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]].

===Lebanon===
* The Lebanese constitution states that the [[President of Lebanon]] is elected by a simple majority of the [[Parliament of Lebanon]].  However, due to the country's delicate ethnic balance, the Parliament's various factions usually try to agree on a consensus candidate.
* Under the unwritten [[National Pact]], the president must always be a [[Maronite Christian]]; the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon|prime minister]] a [[Sunni Muslim]]; the speaker of Parliament a [[Shia Muslim]]; and the deputy speaker [[Greek Orthodox]].

* At the federal level, the [[King of Malaysia|King]] acts on the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]'s advice, except on certain cases. At the state level, the respective ruler or governor acts on his Chief Minister's advice.
* At the federal level, the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] is the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] (House of Representatives) and therefore most likely to command the support of the [[Dewan Rakyat]]; and likewise a Chief Minister, the leader of the party with an absolute majority of seats in a State Legislature and therefore most likely to command the support of such State Legislature. 
* The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] should be a member of the [[Dewan Rakyat]].
* The [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]] chairs the Joint Session of [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], where the King addresses both [[Dewan Negara]] (Senate) and [[Dewan Rakyat]].

===New Zealand===
There is a convention that the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain [[confidence and supply]].{{clarify|date=August 2011}} By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:
*[[New Zealand general election, 1951|1951 general election]]: [[Sidney Holland]] called the election to get a mandate to face down a [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|dockworks dispute]]. The government was returned to power with an increased majority; by this time the dispute had been resolved.
*[[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]]: [[Robert Muldoon]]'s government held a narrow four-seat majority in Parliament. Muldoon hoped to strengthen his leadership, as two backbenchers ([[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]]) were threatening to rebel against the government in an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. However, Waring and Minogue had not threatened to block confidence and supply. The election was a decisive defeat for the government.
*[[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 general election]]: [[Helen Clark]] called the election after the collapse of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], her coalition partners. Some critics argued that the government could still maintain confidence and supply and therefore the early election was not necessary. The Labour Party remained in power with two different coalition partners.

===Norway===
Because of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian political system]] are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.
* Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must maintain the support of parliament (an absence of mistrust) but it need not have its express support.
* All new laws are passed and all new cabinets are therefore formed in a de jure fashion by the King, although not necessarily in a de facto sense.
* According to the written constitution, the cabinet (council of ministers) are appointed by the King. The appointment of new cabinets by the King is a formality, and the king has not directly exercised executive powers since 1905.

===Spain===
Much of Spain's political framework is codified in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]], the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the "arbitrator and moderator of the institutions" of government.

* The King nominates a candidate to stand for the [[Spanish Prime Minister|Presidency of the Government of Spain]], sometimes known in English as 'prime minister'. The nominee then stands before the Congress of Deputies and presents his political agenda for the upcoming legislative term, followed by a [[Indirect election|vote of confidence]] in the nominee and his agenda. The 1978 constitution allows the King to nominate anyone he sees fit to stand for the vote of confidence so long as the King has met with the political party leaders represented in the Congress beforehand. However, King Juan Carlos I has consistently nominated the political party leader who commands a plurality of seats in the Congress of Deputies.
* The Spanish public perception that the monarchy be politically non-partisan in its adherence to constitutional protocol and convention, yet while protecting the public expression of personal political views by members of the royal family. Expressions of personal political views expressed in public include when the Prince of Asturias and his sisters protested against terrorism following the 2004 Madrid bombings, or when the Queen gave controversial political viewpoints during an informal interview.
* Constitutionally, the King appoints the twenty members to the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain. However, when a vacancy is observed the King's appointment has been customarily on the advice of the government of the day. Additionally, the King appoints the President of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain.
* According to the 1978 constitution, grandee and nobility titles, and civil and military decorations, are awarded by the King as head of state. However, in most cases since 1978, the King's appointment of nobility titles have been countersigned by the President of the Government of Spain, with civil awards having been nominated by the President and military awards having been nominated by the military.

=== Switzerland ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Politics of Switzerland]] --&gt;
The following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of [[Switzerland]]. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of [[majority rule]] with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.
* The government is a body of equals composed in [[Concordance system|political proportion]] to the weight of the various factions in [[Parliament]]; this creates a permanent [[grand coalition]].
* Members of a collective body, including the [[Swiss Federal Council|federal government]], observe [[collegiality]] at all times, that is, they do not publicly criticise one another. They also publicly support all decisions of the collective, even against their own opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained at the federal level, at least after the 2003 elections to the [[Swiss Federal Council]].
* The [[President|presidency]] of a collective body, particularly a government, rotates yearly; the president is a [[primus inter pares]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of [[legal instrument]]s that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.

As part of this uncodified British [[constitution]], constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:

* The texts of most international treaties are laid before Parliament at least twenty one days before ratification (the '[[Ponsonby Rule]]' of 1924).
* The monarch will accept and act on the advice of their ministers, who are responsible to Parliament for that advice; the monarch does not ignore that advice, except when exercising [[Reserve powers]].
* The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) with an absolute majority of seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and therefore most likely to command the support of the House of Commons.
* All [[money bills]] must originate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].
* The monarch grants the [[Royal Assent]] to all legislation – sometimes characterised as all legislation passed in good faith. It is possible that ministers could advise against giving consent, as happens with the [[Crown dependencies]] (convention since the early 18th century – previously monarchs did refuse or withhold the Royal Assent).
* The Prime Minister should be a member of either House of Parliament (between the 18th century - 1963).
** In 1963 it was amended to the effect that no Prime Minister should come from the House of Lords. When the last Prime Minister peer, the Earl of Home, took office he renounced his peerage, and as Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became an MP.
** The Prime Minister can hold office temporarily whilst not a Member of Parliament, for example during a General Election or in the case of Douglas-Home, between resigning from the Lords and being elected to the Commons in a by-election.
* All Cabinet members must be members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], since the cabinet is a committee of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow cabinet members are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them "on Privy Council terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf Parliamentary briefing – the Privy Council], accessed 20 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* The House of Lords should not reject a budget passed by the House of Commons. This was broken controversially in 1909 by the House of Lords, which argued that the Convention was linked to another Convention that the Commons would not introduce a Bill that 'attacked' peers and their wealth. The Lords claimed that the Commons broke this Convention in [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s budget, justifying the Lords' rejection of the budget. The Commons disputed the existence of a linked convention. As a consequence, the Lords' powers over budgets were greatly lessened by the [[Parliament Act 1911]].
* During a [[Uk general election|General Election]], no major party shall put up an opponent against a [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker seeking re-election]]. This convention was not respected during the 1987 General Election, when both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] fielded candidates against the Conservative Speaker, [[Bernard Weatherill]], who was MP for [[Croydon North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon North East]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) does stand against the Speaker if he or she represents a [[Scottish Westminster constituencies|Scottish constituency]], as was the case with [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]], Speaker from 2000 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/flash_map/html/map05.stm BBC NEWS | Election 2005 | Election Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Westminster Parliament]] will only legislate on [[reserved matters]]. It will not legislate on non-reserved matters ('[[devolved]] matters') without first seeking the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] (since 1999, the [[Sewel motion|Sewel convention]], later renamed to [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s).
* The House of Lords shall not oppose legislation from the House of Commons that was a part of the government's [[manifesto]] (the [[Salisbury Convention]]).

=== United States ===
*The [[President of the United States]] will give his [[State of the Union address]] annually and in person, before a joint session of Congress. This practice was followed by George Washington and John Adams but abandoned by Thomas Jefferson and not resumed until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his State of the Union address in person.  The constitution requires the President give an update on the state of the union "from time to time", but no specifics are outlined. Speeches have been broadcast on radio since 1923 and 1947; the last State of the Union message delivered only in writing was in 1981.*
*Much of how the [[United States Cabinet]] operates is dictated by convention; its operations are only vaguely alluded to in the US constitution.
*While members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] are only required to live in the state they represent, it has generally been expected that they live in the district they represent as well, though there are some exceptions; [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] was elected in 2010 representing a district adjacent to the one he resided in.
*The [[President of the United States]] will obtain the [[Senatorial courtesy|consent of both Senators from a state]] before appointing a [[United States Attorney]], [[United States district court|federal district judge]], or [[federal marshal]] with jurisdiction in that state.
*Cabinet officials and other major executive officers resign and are replaced when a new President takes office, unless explicitly asked to stay on by the new President.
*The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] is always the Representative who leads the ruling party, even though the Constitution does not specify that the Speaker must be a member of the chamber.  Also by custom the Speaker does not vote (except to break a tie).
*The [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] will be the most senior Senator of the ruling party.
*Members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] are pledged to vote for a particular Presidential candidate, and are chosen by popular vote with the name of the candidate, and not necessarily the elector, on the ballot.
*Senate rules require a majority of 60 votes to invoke [[cloture]], that is, to break off debate on a bill and force a vote. The Senate could revise its rules at any time, but it doesn't, leaving the [[filibuster]] available as a tool for a large-enough minority to indefinitely block any measure it finds objectionable enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1675">{{for|other meanings|Contrast (disambiguation)}}

In [[literature]], an author uses '''contrast''' when he or she describes the difference(s) between two or more entities. For example, in the first four lines of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] ''[[Sonnet 130]]'', Shakespeare contrasts a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.

Contrast is the antonym of [[simile]]. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, [[John Donne]] and the [[metaphysical poetry|metaphysical poets]] developed the [[conceit]] as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In [[Renaissance]] poetry, and particularly in [[sonnet]]s, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of ''my love is unlike all other women'' or ''I am unlike her other loves''.

In the early 18th century, a theory of [[wit]] developed by English writers (particularly [[John Locke]]) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In [[lyric poetry]], the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.

'''Cultural bias''' is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]]. Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.

Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, [[linguistics|linguistic]] and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.

==Cultural bias by discipline==
=== Psychology ===
Cultural bias has no a priori definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Whites]]), ethnic (e.g., [[Latino]]s/Latinas, [[English people|Anglos]]), or national groups (e.g., U.S. [[Americans]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between‐group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of [[African American]] and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their [[White American]] counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across these groups. Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244|title=Cultural Bias in Psychological Testing|last=Helms|first=Janet|editor1-last=Weiner|editor1-first=I. B.|editor2-last=Craighead|editor2-first=W. E.|date=January 30, 2010|encyclopedia=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|publisher=Wiley Online Library, American Cancer Society|accessdate=April 19, 2018|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural bias in [[psychological testing]] refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. However, the limitations they put forth, due to their particular culture-friendliness, has been realized much later. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. The problem lies not with the test-taker, but with the test itself. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychologenie.com/understanding-cultural-bias-with-examples.|title=Understanding the Phenomena of Cultural Bias With Examples|last=PsycholoGenie|first=|date=|website=psychologenie.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Cultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guiso |first=Luigi |last2=Sapienza |first2=Paola |date=October 2008 |title=Cultural Bias in Economic Exchange? |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/cultural_biases.pdf |journal=Forthcoming: Quarterly Journal of Economics |access-date=April 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. This study suggests that low bilaterial trust between two countries will result in less trade, less [[portfolio investment]], and less [[direct investment]]. This effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust intensive.

===Anthropology===
The concept of [[culture theory]] in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.

===Sociology===
It is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias as it is dependent on the group's standing in society, where the [[social construction]]s affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the [[University of California]] by Jane R. Mercer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercer|first1=Jane R. |title=Test "validity", "bias", and "fairness": An analysis from the perspective of the sociology of knowledge|journal=Interchange|date=March 1978|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF01807733|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01807733.pdf|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how test "validity", "bias", and "fairness" in different cultural belief systems affect one's future in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as "the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group", which leads to a belief that "the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups". In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. This idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test will represent the ability of a population as intended and will not reflect the abilities of a group that is not represented.

===History===
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship, when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian's own era are [[anachronism|anachronistically]] used to report and assess events of the past. This tendency is sometimes known as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David H. |last=Fischer |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |title=Historians' Fallacies: toward a logic of historical thought |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1970 |isbn=0061315451 |pages=137–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural icon''' is an [[cultural artifact|artifact]] that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture. The process of identification is subjective, and "icons" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Kent|last2=Martinec|first2=Radan|date=2004-09-01|title=Consumer Perceptions of Iconicity and Indexicality and Their Influence on Assessments of Authentic Market Offerings|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/2/296/1824949/Consumer-Perceptions-of-Iconicity-and-Indexicality|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=296–312|doi=10.1086/422109|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motley|first=Carol M.|last2=Henderson|first2=Geraldine Rosa|date=2008-03-01|title=The global hip-hop Diaspora: Understanding the culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307001609|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Cross-Cultural Business Research|volume=61|issue=3|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[mass media|media]], many items and persons of [[popular culture]] have been called "iconic" despite their lack of durability; and the term "[[pop icon]]" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3713610.html Heard about the famous icon?

The values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an [[apple pie]] is a cultural icon of the [[United States]], but its significance varies among Americans.

National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/dec/09/smashing-statues-sweetest-revenge-protesters-lenin-kiev|publisher=Guardian|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|title=Why smashing statues can be the sweetest revenge}}&lt;/ref&gt; or burning the [[American flag]] to protest US actions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-film-protests-idUSBRE88D0O320120914|publisher=Reuters|date=September 14, 2012|first=ulf|last=Laessing|title=Anti-American fury sweeps Middle East over film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious icon]]s can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the [[Madonna_(art)|Madonna]] in societies with a strong Catholic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating Ourselves, African Americans and Hispanic Americans on popular culture and religious expression|editors=Anthony B Pinn and Benjamin Valentin|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Describing something as ''iconic'' or as an ''icon'' has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' calls "iconic" "a word that makes my flesh creep", a word "pressed into service to describe almost anything."&lt;ref name="LDP"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191891103.html Let's hear it for the Queen's English], ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Christian Examiner]]'' nominates "iconic" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 "iconic" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for "icon", including its use for ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html Modern word usage amazingly leaves us yearning for gay, old times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101358/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html |date=2010-12-25 }}, ''[[Christian Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cultural sensibility''''' refers to how sensibility ("openness to emotional impressions, susceptibility and sensitiveness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1995 | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | author=Thompson, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) relates to a person’s moral, emotional or aesthetic ideas or standards.

[[File:Aerial view of Caerleon Roman amphitheatre.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of a late second-century [[Roman amphitheater]] at [[Isca Augusta]]]]
'''''De Spectaculis''''', also known as '''''On the Spectacles''''' or '''''The Shows''''', is a surviving moral and ascetic treatise by [[Tertullian]]. Written somewhere between 197-202, the work looks at the moral legitimacy and consequences of [[Christianity|Christians]] attending the [[Roman circus|circus]], [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]], or amphitheatre.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian argues that human enjoyment can be an offence to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;De Spectaculis Reginald Melville Chase The Classical Journal, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Nov., 1927), pp. 107-120 Published by: The Classical Association of the Middle West and South Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3289360&lt;/ref&gt; His view of these public entertainments is that they are a misuse of God's creation and a perversion of the gifts God has given to man. He supports his claim by reminding the reader that these shows and spectacles derived from pagan ritual rites (the [[Liberalia]], the [[Consualia]], the [[Equiria]], the [[Bacchanalia]], etc.). This means that the events derive from idolatry. Of key concern was that the "show always leads to spiritual agitation". By attending and partaking in the event, man is subject to strong excitements, which are aroused due to natural lapses, which create passionate desire.  Additionally, Tertullian writes that that which is not permissible to say or do should not be permissible to see or hear.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (Essay 1, Section 15), uses Tertullian's words to highlight the resemblance of [[Christian worship]] to circus-going: "In place of athletes, we have our martyrs; if we crave blood, we have the blood of Christ..." To those addicted to the pleasure of pagan spectacles Tertullian tried to show that Christianity offers far superior spectacles. For this reason he spoke of the [[Second Coming]], the resurrection of the saints, [[New Jerusalem]], and of “what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived” ({{bibleref|1 Cor|2:9}}), but the spectacle on which he enlarged most was the [[Last Judgement]] and the ensuing punishment of the enemies of Christ:

{{quote|[T]hat last day of judgment, with its everlasting issues; that day unlooked for by the nations, the theme of their derision, when the world hoary with age, and all its many products, shall be consumed in one great flame! How vast a spectacle then bursts upon the eye! What there excites my admiration? what my derision? Which sight gives me joy? which rouses me to exultation?--as I see so many illustrious monarchs, whose reception into the heavens was publicly announced, groaning now in the lowest darkness with great Jove himself, and those, too, who bore witness of their exultation; governors of provinces, too, who persecuted the Christian name, in fires more fierce than those with which in the days of their pride they raged against the followers of Christ. What world's wise men besides, the very philosophers, in fact, who taught their followers that God had no concern in ought that is sublunary, and were wont to assure them that either they had no souls, or that they would never return to the bodies which at death they had left, now covered with shame before the poor deluded ones, as one fire consumes them! Poets also, trembling not before the judgment-seat of [[Rhadamanthus]] or [[Minos]], but of the unexpected Christ! I shall have a better opportunity then of hearing the tragedians, louder-voiced in their own calamity; of viewing the play-actors, much more "dissolute" in the dissolving flame; of looking upon the charioteer, all glowing in his chariot of fire; of beholding the wrestlers, not in their gymnasia, but tossing in the fiery billows … What quaestor or priest in his munificence will bestow on you the favour of seeing and exulting in such things as these? And yet even now we in a measure have them by faith in the picturings of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-09.htm#P1011_411386 |title=Tertullian, The Shows, Chapter XXX. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Such an expression of joy over the ruin of [[Damnation|the damned]] finds no match in the other works of [[Early Christianity|early Christians]]. However, it must be taken into account that in an earlier chapter of the treatise Tertullian wrote that “the innocent can find no pleasure in another’s sufferings: he rather mourns that a brother has sinned so heinously as to need a punishment so dreadful.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-09.htm#P966_393495 |title=Tertullian, The Shows, Chapter XIX. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is hard--if not impossible--to reconcile with the one quoted before and it is therefore debatable what Tertullian's real sentiments regarding the damned were.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Domestication theory''' is an approach in [[science and technology studies]] and [[media studies]] that describe the processes by which innovations, especially new [[technology]] is 'tamed' or appropriated by its users. First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.
The theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life.  It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.

One variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. 

The Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by [[Science and technology studies]], [[gender studies]] of household technology, sociology of [[everyday life]], consumption studies and [[innovation]] studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.

As a strand of the [[Social shaping of technology]] approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work  links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).

Domestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and [[ethnography]] to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.

The principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers.  However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much  more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as [[Technology acceptance model]]) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.

The '''Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup''' or '''Eight Immortals Indulged in Wine''' ({{zh|c=飲中八仙|p=yǐnzhōng bāxiān}}) were a group of [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars who are known for their love of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverages]]. They are not deified and ''[[Xian (Daoist)|xiān]]'' ("immortal; transcendent; fairy") is metaphorical. The term is used in a poem by [[Du Fu]], as well as in the [[biography]] of [[Li Bai]] in the [[New Book of Tang]].

They appeared in Du's poem in the following order:

'''Europalia''' is a major [[international]] [[arts festival]] held every two years to celebrate one invited country’s [[cultural heritage]]. Europalia was established in [[Brussels]] in 1969, and from the beginning Europalia was designed to be a [[multidisciplinary]] cultural festival.

Its name is a combination of two words: “[[Europe]]” and “[[Opalia]],” an [[ancient Roman]] [[harvest festival]] held in mid-December in honour of [[Ops]], earth-goddess and fertility deity. Her name lies at the root of the [[Latin]] word “Opus”, that denotes a work of art.

The main Europalia events traditionally take place in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] capital but many other cities across the country also host exhibitions and performances. For several years other European cities (in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]]) have been associated with Europalia and also offer activities on the festival programme.

From the beginning of October to January, the culture of the invited country is illustrated in a prestigious series of exhibitions – [[ancient art|ancient]], [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], [[photography]], [[craft]]s, mode and design – and also a variety of events : [[orchestra]]s, [[musical ensemble]]s and [[solo (music)|soloist]]s, [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[literature|literary]] and [[science|scientific]] colloquia, [[academic conference|conferences]], [[film|cinema]] retrospectives, [[folklore|folkloric]] and popular traditional performances, [[gastronomy]] combine with exhibitions to offer the most complete view possible of a country’s arts and culture. This is the highly original formula of Europalia.

Each festival develops a partnership, not only with the chosen country but also with prominent [[museum]]s, [[cultural center|cultural centres]] and [[performing arts center|performance halls]] in Belgium and neighbouring countries. The festival expenses are shared between Belgium and the invited country. Europalia is financially supported by Belgium’s national, regional and community governments and numerous private companies.

Europalia calls on the collaboration of the most renowned international specialists to help conceive the festival as well as to participate in [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquia]] and conferences. Europalia events are extensively covered by [[television]], [[radio]] and [[print media]], and attract a large European audience, eager to discover a country’s cultural treasures assembled exceptionally for more than three months in this important festival.

==Overview==
Each author has recorded the subjective experiences of various persons in violent environments and surroundings. These are the perspectives of the offenders, victims, noncombatants, soldiers, insurgents, black marketers, heroes, scavengers and researchers. Articles also show how anthropologists are often compelled to create innovative data gathering strategies when working in the midst of dangerous environments.

The '''''Handbook of Texas''''' is a comprehensive [[encyclopedia]] of [[Texas]] geography, history, and historical persons published by the [[Texas State Historical Association]] (TSHA).

==History==
The original ''Handbook'' was the brainchild of TSHA President [[Walter Prescott Webb]] of The University of Texas [[history]] department. It was published as a two-volume set in 1952, with a supplemental volume  published in 1976.

In 1996, the '''New Handbook of Texas''' was published, expanding the encyclopedia to six volumes and over 23,000 articles.

In 1999, the '''Handbook of Texas Online''' went live with the complete text of the print edition, all corrections incorporated into the handbook's second printing, and about 400 articles not included in the print edition due to space limitations. The handbook continues to be updated online, and contains over 25,000 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tshaonline.org/|title=The Handbook of Texas Online|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|isbn=0-87611-151-7|work=Handbook of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online version includes entries on general topics, such as "Texas since World War II", biographies such as notable Texans [[Samuel Houston]] and [[W. D. Twichell]], ranches such as the [[Matador Ranch|Matador]], and geographical entries such as "[[Waco]], Texas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=TEXAS SINCE WORLD WAR II|id=npt02|retrieved=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Houston, Samuel|id=fho73|

Many Texas scholars and professors, such as [[Robert A. Calvert]] and [[Art Martinez de Vara]], have contributed to the ''Handbook.''

An '''independent scientist''' (modern gender-neutral term historically also known as '''gentleman scientist''') is a [[private income|financially independent]] [[scientist]] who pursues [[science|scientific study]] without direct affiliation to a public institution such as a university or government-run [[research and development]] body. The expression "gentleman scientist" arose in post-[[Renaissance]] [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Segen (1992). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FbSlyyshjOoC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=dictionary+%22gentleman+scientist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=juVfcRDdrx&amp;sig=8VsuQLxjLd0kks-vQphH0W5ffOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Dictionary of Modern Medicine]''. p. 246. {{ISBN|1-85070-321-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became less common in the 20th century as government and private funding increased.

Most independent scientists have at some point in their career been affiliated with some academic institution, such as [[Charles Darwin]], who was affiliated with the [[Geological Society of London]].  

==History==
Self-funded scientists practiced more commonly [[History of science policy#Self-funded science|from the Renaissance until the late 19th century]], including the [[Victorian era]], especially in [[England]], before large-scale government and corporate funding was available.  Many early fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] were independent scientists.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Self-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted; however, it has the advantage of eliminating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing [[Grant (money)|grant]] requests to funding bodies. It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist. Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer.

Modern science requires competence and may require access to scientific equipment. However, independent scientists may have past careers as funded scientists, cooperate with funded colleagues, obtain partial equipment-only grants or choose directions where the most expensive resource required is the researcher's time. If the research succeeds, independent scientists may publish results in the same peer-reviewed journals as funded scientists do.

Scientists may choose to work on unusual projects with high risk of failure also when the grant system does not fund them. A scientist could be attributed the status of independent scientist if they work on such projects during a gap between two academic positions, for example.

==Modern-day independent scientists==
Modern-day independent scientists who fund their own research on an independent basis include, for example, [[Stephen Wolfram]] who funds his research through the sale of [[Mathematica]] software, [[Julian Barbour]], [[Aubrey de Grey]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Susan Blackmore]]&lt;ref name="Blackmore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Blackmore |authorlink=Susan Blackmore|date=Oct 24, 2008 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science |title=Solo Science: Tinkering Outside The Tower |publisher=More Intelligent Life |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name="Blackmore"/&gt; and [[John Wilkinson (scientist)|John Wilkinson]] who funds his research on "molecular synergism in nature" by running a regulatory scientific consultancy in natural products.

Peter Rich said of [[Peter D. Mitchell]]: "I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cohen (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell went on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1978. Chemist [[Luis Leloir]] funded the research institute he headed, the [[Leloir Institute|Institute for Biochemical Research]], in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Prizes in Chemistry |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are today several [[wikt:virtual|virtual]] research institutes for independent scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dance|first=Amber|date=2017-03-30|title=Flexible working: Solo scientist|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7647/full/nj7647-747a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7647|pages=747–749|doi=10.1038/nj7647-747a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5967">'''Individualistic culture''' is a society which is characterized by [[individualism]], which is the prioritization or emphasis, of the individual over the entire group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality. They see each other as only loosely linked, and value personal goals over group interests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures tend to have a more diverse population and are characterized with emphasis on personal achievements, and a rational assessment of both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of relationships with others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individualistic cultures have such unique aspects of communication as being a low power-distance culture and having a low-context communication style. Highly individualistic cultures include the U.S., Australia, Great Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication|last=Rothwell|first=J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low power distance==
Power distance is defined to be the degree to which unequal distribution of power is accepted in a culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low power distance cultures challenge authority, encourage a reduction of power differences between management and employees, and encourage the use of power legitimately. Low power distance is more likely to occur in an individualistic culture, because in a collectivist culture, people protect the well being of the group and established order&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so they would be less likely to challenge authority or people in power. Even though individualistic cultures are more likely to be low power distance, these cultures don't expect to completely eliminate power difference. People within this low power distance culture, however, are more likely to respond to such imbalances in power with more negative emotional responses than in the alternative, high power distance cultures. Low power distance cultures include Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Sweden. The U.S. ranks 38th on the scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Low-context communication style==
Individualistic cultures are also more likely to have a low-context communication style. This means that communication is precise, direct, and specific.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hidden Differences: Doing Business with the Japanese|last=Hall|first=Edward|publisher=Anchor Press/Doubleday|year=1987|isbn=0385238835|location=University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in high-context communication, reading between the lines is not necessary in low-context communication. This explicit communication is used in order to prevent any form of misunderstanding between cultures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ability to articulate the thoughts and opinions one holds as well as to express them eloquently are encouraged, as is persuasive speaking. Low-context communication is all content and no relationship dimension.

== Emotion display and display rules ==
Individualistic cultures tend to prioritize the individual person over the group,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture's Consequences|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|publisher=SAGE|year=2001|isbn=0803973241|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be seen in how the display rules vary from a collectivist culture compared to an individualistic culture. Display rules are the rules that exist in different cultures that determine how emotion should be displayed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul|date=1975|title=Facial Areas and Emotional Information|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=25|pages=21–29|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1975.tb00577.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an individualistic culture, self-expression is highly valued, making the display rules less strict and allowing people to display intense emotion such as: happiness, anger, love, etc. While in a collectivist culture, moderation and self-control is highly valued for the well being of the group, and collectivist cultures therefore tend to restrain from showing emotion in public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Conflict strategies ==
Conflict strategies are methods used to resolve different problems. There are different approaches to resolving conflict, and depending the culture a person is brought up in, the more likely it is for them to use a certain approach. Since individualistic culture sets greater value to personal achievement, contrary to collectivist cultures who value harmony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S|date=2006|title=The effects of national culture and face concerns on intention to apologize|url=|journal=Journal of Intercultural Communication Research|volume=3|pages=183–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is more likely for a person from an individualistic culture to use competition as their method of resolving conflict. When using competition as an approach to resolving conflict, a person is more confrontational and seeks to achieve his or her own goals with no regard of the goals of others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sillars|first=A.|date=1980|title=Attributions and communication in roommate conflicts|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=47|pages=180–200|doi=10.1080/03637758009376031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach a person seeks domination, which means to get others to do what the person wants instead of what they initially wanted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the contrary, a collectivist culture would more likely use a less confrontational approach such as accommodation to end the conflict with compromise so that each party is benefited.

An '''involuntary narrative''' occurs as a personal reading of symbolic content transmitted by media-saturated environments. Exposure to postmodern nonlinear narratives, performative and mediated audiovisual arts, predisposes the individual to originate layers of symbolic meaning that overlap with socially codified environments.
The '''involuntary narrative''' has neither been constructed by an author of media content, nor read as such by a reader/spectator.

Illusion and displacement are some of the effects resulting in an individual, when connections are drawn between a trigger in one sensory channel and a result in another, virtual and physical states and conditions of one and the same object, media or technology are perceived as a continuum.  
When a purposeful overlap of the physical and the virtual takes place, it could be called [[vireal]] (Gramelsberger, Klein).

The '''involuntary narrative,''' [[hypnagogia]] and the [[Dreamachine]], trigger what is already in the individual by referring to his or her own past history. The '''involuntary narrative''' is accidental and in that differs from both the hypnagogic state and the state induced by the Dreamachine.

Auditive and visual signals, as for example mobile phone ringtones, virtual identity thumbnails, alert sounds, signals and information screens in public transport, adverts displayed in LED screens, constitute stimuli to trigger the occurrence of an involuntary narrative.
Anamnesis, as used by Pascal Broccolichi in his work ''Lexicon:'' ”when a sound, or a sound context, recalls a situation or an environment that has been taken out of its chronology”.&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of “sound phenomena noted in various contexts with acoustic or psychoacoustic connotations”, published in: Palais de Tokyo/Magazine 09, Summer 2009, Spy Numbers, and available online at this address: http://www.pascalbroccolichi.com/index.php?/projets/lexicon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Influences==
As the density of visible and audible mass communication in the urban environment increased in the 20th century, historical predecessors of '''involuntary narratives''' emerged. The attempt to create parallel levels of meaning in the perception of the physically real is an objective these predecessors have in common.
Applying the [[cut-up technique]], invented in the 1960s by [[Bryon Gysin]], to text, [[William Burroughs]]&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, W. S. (1970). The Electronic Revolution. Ubuweb, 2005 edition. http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf (accessed 30-09-2010)&lt;/ref&gt; achieved results of new narratives (whose order/sequence had not been put together willingly) which would often yield surprising results, even giving account of future events that were later verified. 
The [[dérive]] (English: drift) developed in the 1950s by the [[Situationists]] is a technique to explore and navigate urban space without preformalized trajectories.
Misreadings of common everyday objects, as used in [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]], some of no symbolic content, some of highly symbolic content produce results similar to the ones described here, but are always authored.

[[File:Nomorekaroshi-shimbashiprotest-june-13-2018.jpg|thumb|A "No More Karōshi" protest in [[Tokyo]], 2018]]
{{nihongo|3='''''Karōshi'''''|2=過労死}}, which can be translated literally as "overwork death" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is occupational sudden mortality. The major medical causes of ''karōshi'' deaths are [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] due to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and a [[starvation diet]]. This phenomenon is also widespread in other parts of Asia as well.

==History==
The first case of ''karōshi'' was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the [[Freight transport|shipping]] department of [[Japan]]'s largest newspaper company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.workhealth.org/whatsnew/lpkarosh.html |title=Karoshi-Death from overwork: Occupational health consequences of the Japanese production management|date=February 4, 1997|journal=International Journal of Health Services|authors=Katsuo Nishiyama and Jeffrey V. Johnson|accessdate=June 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214232217/http://workhealth.org/whatsnew/lpkarosh.html |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was invented in 1978 to refer to an increasing number of people suffering from fatal strokes and heart attacks attributed to overwork. A book on the issue in 1982 brought the term into public usage.

It was not until the mid to late 1980s, during the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Bubble Economy]], when several high-ranking business [[corporate officer|executives]] who were still in their prime years suddenly died without any previous sign of illness, that the term emerged into Japanese public life. This new phenomenon was immediately seen as a new and serious menace for people in the work force. In 1987, as public concern increased, the [[Japanese Ministry of Labour]] began to publish statistics on ''karōshi''.

In 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week, which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour weekly working schedule. Realizing the seriousness and widespread nature of this emerging problem, a group of lawyers and doctors set up “karoshi hotlines” that are nationally available, dedicating to help those who seek consultation on karoshi related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Marioka, Koji. "Work Till You Drop.” New Labor Forum, vol. 13, no. 1 (spring 2004), pp. 80-
85, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40342456?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents. Accessed: 18 Jan. 2018.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's rise from the devastation of [[World War II]] to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new [[epidemic]]. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6–7 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally. It is common for the [[overtime]] to go unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-11suits.13624023.html Japanese salarymen fight back] ''The New York Times'' - Wednesday, June 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2009/gb2009015_807968.htm Recession Puts More Pressure on Japan's Workers] Business Week, January 5, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107010556/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2009/gb2009015_807968.htm |date=January 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[International Labour Organization]] article about ''karōshi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/publications/WCMS_211571/lang--en/index.htm|title=Case Study: Karoshi: Death from overwork|date=23 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following four typical cases of ''karōshi'' were mentioned:
# Mr. A worked at a major snack food processing company for as long as 110 hours a week (not a month) and died from a heart attack at the age of 34. His death was recognized as work-related by the Labour Standards Office.
# Mr. B, a [[bus driver]], whose death was also recognized as work-related, worked 3,000 hours a year. He did not have a day off in the 15 years before he had a stroke at the age of 37.
# Mr. C worked in a large printing company in [[Tokyo]] for 4,320 hours a year including [[Shift work|night work]] and died from a stroke at the age of 58. His widow received workers' compensation 14 years after her husband's death.
# Ms. D, a 22-year-old nurse, died from a heart attack after 34 hours of continuous duty five times a month.
As well as physical pressure, [[Stress (biology)|mental stress]] from the workplace can cause ''karōshi''. People who commit [[suicide]] due to mental stress are called "''karōjisatsu'' (過労自殺)." The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:
# All-night, late-night or holiday work, both long and excessive hours. During the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|long-term economic recession]] after the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1980s and 1990s, many companies reduced the number of employees. The total amount of work, however, did not decrease, forcing each employee to work harder.
# Stress accumulated due to frustration at not being able to achieve the goals set by the company. Even in economic recession, companies tended to demand excessive sales efforts from their employees and require them to achieve better results. This increased the psychological burden placed on the employees at work.
# [[Dismissal (employment)|Forced resignation, dismissal]], and [[bullying]]. For example, employees who worked for a company for many years and saw themselves as loyal to the company were suddenly asked to resign because of the need for staff cutbacks.
# Suffering of [[middle management]]. They were often in a position to [[Layoff|lay off]] workers and torn between implementing a corporate restructuring policy and protecting their staff.

==Karoshi Hotline==
In a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either passed away because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Kato, Tetsuro. “The Political Economy of Japanese 'Karoshi' (Death from Overwork).” Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies, vol. 26, no. 2 (December 1994), pp. 41-54. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294355?seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents.&lt;/ref&gt; This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overworking or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly by seeking help.

The Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year decreased, but still maintained an average of 400 calls per year.&lt;ref&gt;Karoshi Hotline: National Defense Counsel for Victims of KAROSHI. "Karoshi Hotline Results". http://karoshi.jp/english/results.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its availability is nationwide, ranging from Hokkaido(北海道) to Kanto(関東).&lt;ref&gt;Karoshi Hotline: National Defense Counsel for Victims of KAROSHI.

==Effects on society==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}

Suicide can be induced by overwork-related stresses or when businessmen are laid off from their jobs.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adelstein|first1=Jake|title=Killing Yourself To Make A Living: In Japan Financial Incentives Reward "Suicide"|url=http://www.japansubculture.com/killing-yourself-to-make-a-living-in-japan-financial-social-incentives-keep-suicide-rates-high/|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deceased person's relatives demand [[Damages|compensation]] payments when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"/&gt; They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order to receive the money.&lt;ref name="japansubculture.com"/&gt;

There is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of ''karōshi''. Young Japanese are choosing part-time work, contrary to their elder counterparts who work overtime. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for "hourly wages rather than regular salaries,"&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are called "[[freeter]]s." The number of freeters has increased throughout the years,&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Freeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as "part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed as part-time workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanai|title=Karoshi (Work to Death) in Japan|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeters are not in school, are aged 15–34, and if they are women, are unmarried. The movement of the freeters has its problems, however. Most freeters fail to launch successful careers, based on a few factors.

Due to their part-time work, their annual income is around 1 million [[Japanese yen|yen]], or around $8,500 USD. Also, economic growth in Japan is slow, making it difficult for freeters to switch to regular employment. Another problem is that freeters are given menial tasks, which makes it almost impossible to gain any real experience, which is necessary when converting to full-time employment. (Kanai, 2003) It may seem as if being a freeter is the answer to the overworked, near-''karōshi'' individual suffering from long work hours. Those who are being non-regular employees or freeters who are supposedly wanting to only work part-time are finding themselves working 60 hours a week or more. Since non-regular employees' wages are so low, it is necessary for them to work longer hours, negating the desire to be a freeter. Freeters are now facing the risk of ''karōshi'', just as regular workers have, due to their long hours.

There are other undesirable results, other than ''karōshi'', that arise from working long hours. A psychological trait known as [[Workaholic|workaholism]] has been shown to lead one to work long hours. (Spence &amp; Robbins, 1992) There are three defining factors of workaholism: high work involvement, being driven to or compelled to work by inner pressures, and low enjoyment of work. (Kanai, 1996). The last of these factors suggests a contradiction. However, Kanai argued that workaholism is not a psychological trait, but rather results from adaptation to that work demand overload. Individuals that overload on work are not doing so because they are workaholics, but that the demand of the workload brings out psychologically and behavioral characteristics similar to those with workaholism. Management welcomes hard work and rewards with promotions. Morioka (2005), suggests that in order to eliminate the harmful effects of workaholism, the workplace should be responsible for managing workload issues.

Overworking also has a negative effect on the family. Men who become too busy with their jobs think less about their family. High levels of family [[Depression (mood)|depression]] exist as a result. As the men focus on their jobs, they tend to develop negative feelings towards family. They take on less of a role in family life as they continue to overwork. The men see the family as something that is taking away from their work, which creates a resentment toward the family. As a result, avoidance of family time increases, even though it is their family that inspires them to work hard in the first place (Kanai, 2002). Kanai's findings suggest that excessive working hours are harmful to family life, not only in that are they spending less time with their families, but that they also develop hostility towards the family.

However, it could also be said that the men had taken on these jobs for the sake of providing for their family, but ultimately become less effective as a resource due to their exhaustion and complete focus on earning money. It is likely salarymen go into that lifestyle simply for the money, because the jobs pay well; if they work long hours, they can earn large sums of money and send it to their families to help provide for them, since in traditional Japanese families, the father is usually the main worker in the household. In an interview, a man had said that "the best thing about being born male was, 'having a family, and being able to support that family.' Conversely the worst thing was 'being unable to quit your job even if you want to' due to the same responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility men have to provide for the family correlates with their masculinity, so if a man gets laid off he may think that "their own ability is really poor, and would get quite depressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Romit|title=Salarymen doing straight: Heterosexual men and the dynamics of gender conformity|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressures are ones that society puts on them, since it is expected that the men work and provide for the family.

The Cabinet Office analyzes the Household Survey on the Quality of Life to examine how large of an impact overwork has on health issues, including karoshi. The study finds that a long weekly working schedule, which is defined as over 60 hours for men and over 45 hours for women, significantly increased the anxiety of employees who believe they will be suffering from health issues. In other words, regardless of whether employees had health issues, merely working for longer hours created anxiety towards perceived health issues. The 15-hour gap between men and women does not mean that women are less capable of dealing with stress, but is because of the traditional Japanese value that puts the burden of taking care of children and other mundane household tasks on women. Women thus have much larger range of responsibilities to be concerned with, in addition to their everyday jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamesaka, Akiko and Tamura, Teruyuki. “Work Hours and Anxiety Towards Karoshi”.

The [[Crisis hotline|suicide prevention hotline]] in Japan is often so busy, callers occasionally have to try between 30 and 40 times until they can get an answer.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAVING 10,000 - Winning a War on Suicide in Japan - 自殺者１万人を救う戦い - Japanese Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0SHLxc2d0|website=Youtube|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, roughly 30,000 people in Japan commit suicide.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; A potential reason why the number is so high could be the kind of camaraderie involved in the process of committing suicide, where people will spend time searching online to find other suicidal individuals and then "[[Suicide pact|make plans to die together]]."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==Government Policies==
To provide a strategic plan on how to decreases the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other disease caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from three different groups, the government, the labour unions and employers, and the employees. The government, as the policy maker, should promote shorter working hours, make health services readily accessible, encourage voluntary health examination and enhance the effectiveness of medical care. As the group that is more closely involved with the everyday health of employees, labour unions and employers should strive to implement and comply with government policies that focus on reducing work overtime and create a better work environment. The employees themselves should recognize their needs to take rests promptly and take preventative measures as needed.&lt;ref&gt;Araki, Shunichi, and Iwasaki, Kenji. “Death Due to Overwork (Karoshi): Causation, health service, and life expectancy of Japanese males.” Japan Medical Association Journal, vol. 48, no. 2, February, 2005, pg. 92-98. http://www.med.or.jp/english/pdf/ 2005_02/092_098.pdf. Accessed: 19 Jan, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher possibility of having work related illness.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Safety and Health Act (Act No. 57 of 1972) http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/ hourei/data/isha.pdf. Accessed: 22 Jan, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It might seem to be an odd decision, speaking from an economic standpoint, to use government policy to force companies to reduce work hours. It seems to be counterproductive of the profit maximizing nature of market economy. This counterintuitive intervention, according to Yoshio Higuchi, is attributed to the several factors unique to the Japanese society. Traditionally, Japanese workers are very loyal employees.&lt;ref name="esri.go.jp"&gt;Kamesaka, Akiko and Tamura, Teruyuki. “Work Hours and Anxiety Towards Karoshi”. Economic and Social Research Institute Discussion Papers, No. 325, March, 2017. http://www.esri.go.jp/jp/archive/e_dis/e_dis325/e_dis325-e.pdf. Accessed: 9 Feb. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common for someone to work for the same company from a freshly out of school graduate to a nearly retired man. The society also views those who constantly change jobs with skeptical eyes. Such discouragement directly caused the difficulty in moving into new jobs. Thus, companies usually have a much higher bargaining power when it comes to “exploiting” their employees. In order to cut costs, companies would usually demand their employees work for longer hours instead of hiring someone to take over part of the workload. Therefore, if the government does not intervene and mandate companies to reduce working time, no orders would be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="esri.go.jp"/&gt;

The current Labor Standards Act is not effective if the majority of the representative employees agree with working over 40 hours per week, despite clauses in the Act prohibits such overtime. A study by the Cabinet Office of the Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan (the Cabinet Office) pointed out that refusing to consent with the ILO's treaty on work time regulations could be a large contributing factor to the current state of the labor market.

==Salaryman==
{{Main|Salaryman}}

A Japanese businessman, also known as a [[salaryman]] (サラリーマン, "''sararīman''"), is often a victim of ''karōshi'' due to the strenuous work hours their job requires, in addition to the mandatory after-hours socializing and drinking that their jobs require.&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakamoto|first1=Kay|title=Why Drinking With Coworkers Is So Important In Japanese Work Culture|url=https://blog.gaijinpot.com/japanese-drinking-culture/|website=Gaijinpot|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these salarymen are invited to [[nomikai]], or "drinking parties," to build better connections between coworkers in the company.&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"/&gt; According to an article on Gaijinpot, "A common saying in Japan is, 'if you want to work your way up the corporate ladder you have to drink.' This was how many older generation workers established relationships and considered this the normal way of doing business."&lt;ref name="blog.gaijinpot.com"/&gt;

According to these values, a key to business success was a willingness to go out and participate in this mandatory socializing with coworkers. Since not everyone can keep up with the pace and immersion of salaryman life, stress-induced death became fairly common. Due to this high-stress nature of a salaryman's job, death by cardivascular diseases or mental disorders were some of the two biggest factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanai|first1=Atsuko|title="Karoshi (Work to Death)" in Japan|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=18 March 2008|volume=84|pages=209–216|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9701-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Japanese businessmen are under a lot of work-related pressures, ''karōshi'' suicides have increased, especially due to economic crises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondo|first1=Naoki|last2=Oh|first2=Juhwan|title=Suicide and karoshi (death from overwork) during the recent economic crises in Japan: the impacts, mechanisms and political responses|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|date=August 2010|volume=64|issue=8|pages=649|doi=10.1136/jech.2009.090787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those that were able to keep their jobs, after their company laid off multiple employees, experienced a large increase in work. "In 2000, 28% of regular Japanese employees worked 50 hours or more per week, compared to 16% to 21% in [[New Zealand]], [[United States|USA]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and less than 6% in 13 other industrialized nations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Businessmen in Japan have been overworked, but [[physician]]s specifically have been feeling great pressures of being overworked, while still facing a moral obligation to continue. Physicians work an average of 65 hours a week or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiyama|first1=T|last2=Yoshihara|first2=M|title=New occupational threats to Japanese physicians: karoshi (death due to overwork) and karojisatsu (suicide due to overwork)|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2008|volume=65|issue=6|page=428|doi=10.1136/oem.2007.037473}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They are reaching the limit in terms of the number of service hours they can provide without risking their own health.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiyama|first1=T|last2=Yoshihara|first2=M|title=New occupational threats to Japanese physicians: karoshi (death due to overwork) and karojisatsu (suicide due to overwork)|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2008|volume=65|issue=6|page=429|doi=10.1136/oem.2007.037473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government used to have restrictions on the number of physicians that could attend medical school, but now they have increased medical school enrollment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It takes years for physicians to become qualified, so it is critical that alternative measures come into play before ''karōshi'' takes a toll on physicians in Japan.

==Corporate response==
A number of companies have been making an effort to find a better work-life balance for their employees. [[Toyota Motor Company|Toyota]], for example, now generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. [[Nissan]] offers [[telecommuting]] for office workers to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents.&lt;ref name="BW"/&gt; Dozens of large corporations have also implemented "no overtime days", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. However, since their workload is too high, few workers can actually take advantage of this, and opt to stay in the office with the lights off or to simply take their work home, "cloaked overtime" called "''[[furoshiki]]''" (風呂敷) after the Japanese traditional wrapping cloth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 2007, [[Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation|Mitsubishi UFJ Trust &amp; Banking]], a division of Japan's largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company's 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;

In February 2017, [[Japanese government|Japanese Government]] launched a campaign called "[[Premium Friday]]" asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm [[Dentsu]] who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as [[Honda]], the drinks maker [[Suntory]] and the confectioner [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga]], have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the [[Nikkei Business Publications|Nikkei business]] newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of [[Premium Friday]] or had plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/premium-fridays-japan-gives-workers-break-go-shopping|title=Premium Fridays: Japan gives its workers a break – to go shopping|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-02-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with unpaid overtime in companies is that the overtime is simply not recorded in many cases. The amount of overtime is regulated by labor regulations, so, in order to not contradict labor regulations, workers are told not to record the overtime, since it would be considered an illegal action from the side of the company. The workers themselves often rationalize this by attributing the overwork to lacking skills from their side, describing a lack of familiarity with the work, "not being trained enough" as the cause for not being able to finish in a more timely manner. In general, overtime is something that is accepted as part of work, and protest against it is rare, due to concern for the reaction of colleagues, superiors and even family and friends.

"''Seken''" (世間), or the "public gaze" (others' opinions about one's behavior) is a strong cultural factor in this. It is safe to assume that most statistics of overtime in Japanese companies are not accurate, since overtime is not recorded in many occasions. It is not uncommon for many Japanese employees to work late hours until 2-3am, and being expected to be in the office again at 9am. In some cases (especially in subsidiaries of big listed companies that have to cope with the pressure of parent companies, who generate margins through exploitation of daughter companies) employees have been reported to have worked 300 hours of overtime in a single month. These statistics are in almost all cases not official, and most employees would always refrain from making such statements to authorities or the press, nor would they agree to be named.

==China==
In China, the analogous "death by overwork" concept is '''''guolaosi''''' (Traditional:過勞死 Simplified:过劳死), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Work Killing You? In China, Workers Die at Their Desks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-29/is-work-killing-you-in-china-workers-die-at-their-desks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building [[guanxi]]. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote “Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich,” about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the 'biggest boss in [[Chengdu]],' was in the hospital for 'excessive drinking.' This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, “I can't stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally 'depend on me to eat.'). I've got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osburg|first1=John|title=Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich|date=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
In South Korea, the term '''''gwarosa''''' (과로사) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 68.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vagabondjourney.com/south-korean-work-hours-highest-in-oecd/&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from gwarosa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2017/02/641_224791.html&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce many problems caused from overworking, the government enacted a law cutting the working hours from 68 to 52.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/01/south-korea-cuts-inhumanely-long-68-hour-working-week&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention==
The French-German [[Television channel|TV channel]] [[Arte]] showed a documentary called "Alt in Japan" (Old in Japan) on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, ''karōshi'' again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-07-10/business/17170864_1_toyota-city-heart-disease-camry|title=Man, 45, died of overwork, Japanese labor bureau says|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taiwan]]ese media have reported a case of ''karōshi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20100927/32843024/|title=月加班 百小時 29歲工程師過勞死 - 蘋果日報|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer had worked for Nanya Technology for 3 years from 2006 to 2009. It was found that he died in front of his computer which was surrounded by company documents. The prosecution found that the engineer had died of [[cardiogenic shock]]. The engineer's parents said that he had usually worked for 16–19 hours a day. [[CNN]] shows another reported case of ''karōshi'' in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="CNN: The Dangers of Overwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN: The Dangers of Overwork|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUPXuU2unRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short clip called "The Dangers of Overwork" shows a man who suffered a stroke and was left for three hours until taken to the hospital.&lt;ref name="CNN: The Dangers of Overwork"/&gt; It was made known that physicians are starting to make people more aware of these health deficits due to overworking. More people have been visiting their doctor, recognizing these signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name="CNN: The Dangers of Overwork"/&gt;

In [[cultural anthropology]], a '''leveling mechanism''' is a practice that acts to ensure [[social equality]], usually by shaming or humbling members of a group that attempt to put themselves above other members.&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/9780415485395/glossary.asp |title=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Issues - Student Resources Glossary|author=Eller, Jack David |publisher=[[Routledge]] |work=Cultural Anthropology: Global Forces, Local Lives |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One commonly given example of a leveling mechanism is the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] practice of "shaming the meat", particularly as illustrated by the Canadian anthropologist [[Richard Borshay Lee]] in his article "Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" (1969).&lt;ref name="christmas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |title=Eating Christmas in the Kalahari |publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]] |year=1969 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704230658/http://windward.hawaii.edu/facstaff/dagrossa-p/articles/EatingChristmas.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lee gave the !Kung an ox as a Christmas gift, the !Kung responded by insulting the gift, calling it a "bag of bones" and joking that they would have to eat the horns because there was no meat on it. Lee later asked a man named Tomazo why his gift was insulted in this way. He responded that it was because the gift was arrogant. Lee asked what he meant by this and was told:

{{quote|"Yes, when a young man kills much meat he comes to think of himself as a chief or a big man, and he thinks of the rest of us as his servants or inferiors. We can’t accept this. We refuse one who boasts, for someday his pride will make him kill somebody. So we always speak of his meat as worthless. This way we cool his heart and make him gentle."|Tomazo|"Eating Christmas in the Kalahari" &lt;ref name="christmas"/&gt;}}

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000).

==Africa==

===Angola===
*[[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba]]  valiantly fought and held off [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control of present-day [[Angola]] for over thirty years during the early 17th century.

===Benin history===

* The [[Dahomey Amazons]] (or ''N'Nonmiton'', meaning ''our mothers'' in the [[Fon language]]), were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment in [[Dahomey]], an African kingdom (c. 1600–1894) located in the area of the present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the semi-mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

===Berber history===
*[[Kahina]] or '''al-Kāhina''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a 7th-century female [[Berber people|Berber]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to Arab expansion in [[Northwest Africa]], the region then known as [[Numidia]], known as the [[Maghreb]] today. She was born in the early 7th century and died around the end of the 7th century probably in modern-day [[Algeria]].

===Burkina Faso===
*[[Yennenga]] was a legendary warrior woman skilled in spear and bow, considered by the [[Mossi people]] as the mother of their empire.

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The warrior goddess [[Sekhmet]], shown with her sun disk and cobra crown]]
*[[Ankt]] may have originated in [[Asia Minor]]. Within [[Egypt]] she was later syncretized as [[Neith]] (who by that time had developed aspects of a war goddess).
*[[Cleopatra VII]] was a [[Hellenistic]] co-ruler of Egypt with her father ([[Ptolemy XII of Egypt|Ptolemy XII Auletes]]) and later with her brothers/husbands [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt|Ptolemy XIII]] and [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]]. Her patron goddess was [[Isis]], and thus during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom.
*[[Sekhmet]] is a warrior goddess depicted as a [[lion]]ess, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians.

This Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appins.org/martin.htm "A Voyage to St. Kilda" in ''A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland''(1703)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313003106/http://www.appins.org/martin.htm |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

[[Nusaybah bint Ka’ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature.

He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

She is also known for her diplomatic and political skills and successful military campaigns. The capital of Madurai Kingdom during her times was Tiruchy.

===Rani Velu Nachiyar===
*Rani Velu Nachiyar (Tamil: இராணி வேலு நாச்சியார்) was an 18th-century Indian Queen from Sivaganga. Rani Velu Nachiyar was the first Queen to fight against the British in India, even preceding the famous Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi. She was the princess of Ramanathapuram and the daughter of Chellamuthu Sethupathy. She married the king of Siva Gangai and they had a daughter - Vellachi Nachiar. When her husband Muthuvaduganathaperiya Udaiyathevar was killed, she was drawn into battle. Her husband and his second wife were killed by a few British soldiers and the son of the Nawab of Arcot. She escaped with her daughter, lived under the protection of Hyder Ali at Virupachi near Dindigul for eight years. During this period, she formed an army and sought an alliance with Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali with the aim of attacking the British. In 1780, Rani Velu Nachiyar fought the British with military assistance from Gopala Nayaker and Hyder Ali and won the battle. When Velu Nachiyar finds the place where the British stock their ammunition, she builds the first human bomb. A faithful follower, Kuyili douses herself in oil, lights herself and walks into the storehouse. Rani Velu Nachiyar formed a woman's army named “udaiyaal” in honour of her adopted daughter — Udaiyaal, who died detonating a British arsenal. Nachiar was one of the few rulers who regained her kingdom and ruled it for 10 more years.

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

'''Monoculturalism''' is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/monoculturalism Monoculturalism], online Oxford dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Y. Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it may also involve the process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of [[cultural diversity]], is the opposite of [[multiculturalism]].
 
Rather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country's national culture via the exclusion of external influences. [[Japan]], [[China]], [[South Korea]], and [[North Korea]] are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. For instance, some European countries such as [[Finland]] are still effectively monocultural because of the people's shared culture and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|reason=There's no citation marked for this claim.|date=October 2017}}

== Ethnocentric monoculturalism ==
The idea of monoculturalism can be expanded to that of [[ethnocentrism]]. Ethnocentrism being the idea that one's ethnic background is superior to that of others. A feeling of superiority is one that can project mono-cultural ideals in an attempt to justify intrinsic ways of thinking. In nations with a majority of the population being native, ethnocentrism is blindly put upon those of other cultural backings. The idea of ethnocentrism being combined with monoculturalism yields many examples from history. Most obvious is the Holocaust, but further from that is any instance of genocide or simple racism. In defining genocide you can find the correlation it has with monoculturalism, and how it can be a resultant of mono-cultural, as well as, ethnocentric thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sue|first=Derald Wing|title=Whiteness and Ethnocentric Monoculturalism: Making the "Invisible" Visible|journal=American Psychologist|volume=November 2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instances ==

=== In genocide ===

In many of the [[genocide]]s practiced throughout history, some of them were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutu's and Tutsi's from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kenneth R. "Scourge of Racism: Genocide in Rwanda". ''Journal of Black Studies''. Vol. 39, No. 3 (Jan., 2009), pp. 471-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar example to that of the Rwandan Genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from England, in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn't involve many of Burma's Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them.&lt;ref&gt;"Tracking Genocide: Persecution of the Karen in Burma". ''Texas international law journal''. Volume: 48 Issue: 1 Page: 63 10/01/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the [[Karen people|Karen]], have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar [[world view]]s, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale.&lt;ref&gt;Marsella, Anthony (2005). [http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MarsellaHegemonicGlobalizationAustralianMosaic.pdf ""Hegemonic" Globalization and Cultural Diversity: The Risks of Global Monoculturalism"] (PDF). ''Australian Mosaic''. Issue 11 Number 13: 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.

'''Narrative history''' is the practice of writing [[history]] in a story-based form. It tends to entail history-writing based on reconstructing series of short-term events, and since the influential work of [[Leopold von Ranke]] on professionalising history-writing in the nineteenth century has been associated with [[empiricism]]. The term ''narrative history'' thus overlaps with the term ''histoire événementielle'' ('event-history') coined by [[Fernand Braudel]] in the early twentieth century, as he promoted forms of history-writing analysing much longer-term trends (what he called the ''[[longue durée]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory'', ed. by Michael Payne and Jessica Rae Barbera, 2nd edn (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), s.v. 'Braudel, Fernand' (p. 90).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though history is considered a social science, the story-based nature of history allows for the inclusion of a greater or lesser degree of narration in addition to an analytical or interpretative exposition of historical knowledge. It can be divided into two subgenres: the traditional narrative and the modern narrative.

'''Traditional narrative''' focuses on the chronological order of history. It is event driven and tends to center upon individuals, action, and intention. For example, in regard to the [[French Revolution]], a historian who works with the traditional narrative might be more interested in the revolution as a single entity (one revolution), centre it in [[Paris]], and rely heavily upon major figures such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]].

Conversely, '''modern narrative''' typically focuses on structures and general trends. A modern narrative would break from rigid chronology if the historian felt it explained the concept better. In terms of the French Revolution, a historian working with the modern narrative might show general traits that were shared by revolutionaries across [[France]] but would also illustrate regional variations from those general trends (many confluent revolutions). Also this type of historian might use different sociological factors to show why different types of people supported the general revolution.

Historians who use the modern narrative might say that the traditional narrative focuses too much on what happened and not enough on why and causation. Also, that this form of narrative reduces history into neat boxes and thereby does an injustice to history. [[J H Hexter]] characterized such historians as "lumpers". In an essay on [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], he remarked that "lumpers do not like accidents: they would prefer them vanish...The lumping historian wants to put all of the past into boxes..and then to tie all the boxes together into one nice shapely bundle."

Historians who use traditional narrative might say that the modern narrative overburdens the reader with trivial data that had no significant effect on the progression of history. They believe that the historian needs to stress what is consequential in history, as otherwise the reader might believe that minor trivial events were more important than they were.

'''Nazareth College''' is a [[coeducational]], [[Private colleges|private]], religiously independent college in [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors &lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/academics]&lt;/ref&gt;and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as "Naz" for short. 

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26937">{{short description|Narrative technique}}
'''Nonlinear narrative''', '''disjointed narrative''' or '''disrupted narrative''' is a [[narratology|narrative technique]], sometimes used in [[literature]], film, [[hypertext]] websites and other narratives, where events are portrayed, for example, out of [[chronological]] order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern of the events featured, such as parallel distinctive plot lines, dream immersions or narrating another story inside the main plot-line. It is often used to mimic the structure and recall of human [[memory]], but has been applied for other reasons as well.

== Literature ==
Beginning a narrative ''[[in medias res]]'' (Latin: "into the middle of things") began in ancient times and was established as a convention of [[epic poetry]] with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' in the 8th century BC. The technique of narrating most of the story in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] also dates back to the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', around the 5th century BC. Several medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tales such as "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]", "[[The City of Brass]]" and "[[The Three Apples]]" also had nonlinear narratives employing the ''in medias res'' and flashback techniques, inspired by Indian tales like [[Panchatantra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[modernist literature|modernist]] novelists [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[Marcel Proust]], and [[William Faulkner]] experimented with narrative chronology and abandoning linear order.&lt;ref&gt;Heise, Ursula K. (1997). ''Chronoschisms: Time, Narrative, and Postmodernism''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 77 {{ISBN|0-521-55544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Examples of nonlinear novels are:
* [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759–67)
* [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' (ca. 1833)
* [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847)
* [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'' (1915)
* [[Sadeq Hedayat]]'s ''[[The Blind Owl]]'' (1937)
* [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939)
* [[Brian O'Nolan|Flann O'Brien (pseudonym for Brian O'Nolan)]]'s ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' (1939)
* [[William S. Burroughs|William S. Burroughs']] ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959)
* [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961)
* [[Muriel Spark]]'s ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1961)
* [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969)
* [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]]'s ''[[Going After Cacciato]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maso|first=Carole|authorlink=Carole Maso|title=Ava: a novel|series=Fiction|publisher=[[Dalkey Archive Press]]|location=[[Normal, Illinois]]|isbn=1-56478-029-5|oclc=26763542|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić's]] ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' (1988)
* [[Irvine Welsh]]'s ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993)
* [[Carole Maso]]'s ''Ava: a novel'' (1993)
* [[Arundhati Roy]]'s [[The God of Small Things]] (1997) 
* [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]'s ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]] (2004)
* [[Erin Morgenstern]]'s [[The Night Circus]] (2011)
* [[Emily St. John Mandel]]'s ''[[Station Eleven]]'' (2014)
* [[Marc Anthony Richardson]]'s [[Marc Anthony Richardson|Year of the Rat]] (2016)

Several of Michael Moorcock's novels, particularly those in the Jerry Cornelius series, in particular ''[[The English Assassin: A Romance of Entropy]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Condition of Muzak]]'' (1977) are notable for extending the nonlinear narrative form in order to explore the complex nature of identity within a multiversal universe.

[[Scott McCloud]] argues in ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' that the narration of comics is nonlinear because it relies on the reader's choices and interactions.

== Film ==
{{See also|List of nonlinear narrative films}}
Defining nonlinear structure in film is, at times, difficult. Films may use extensive [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s or [[flashforward]]s within a linear storyline, while nonlinear films often contain linear sequences.&lt;ref name="Blum"&gt;Blum, Richard A. (2001). ''Television and Screen Writing: From Concept to Contract''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-240-80384-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Welles|Orson Welles']] ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)—influenced structurally by ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933)—and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950) use a non-chronological flashback narrative that is often labeled nonlinear.

=== Silent and early era ===
Experimentation with nonlinear structure in film dates back to the [[silent film]] era, including [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) and [[Abel Gance]]'s ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Debruge"&gt;Debruge, Peter (December 7, 2007).

Retrieved on February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonlinear film emerged from the French [[avant-garde]][5] in 1924 with [[René Clair]]’s ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'', Dadaïst film and then in 1929 with [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]]'s ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (English: ''An Andalusian Dog''). The [[surrealist]] film jumps into fantasy and juxtaposes images, granting the filmmakers an ability to create statements about the Church, art, and society that are left open to interpretation.&lt;ref name="DancygerRush"&gt;Dancyger, Ken &amp; Rush, Jeff.

The revolutionary Russian filmmakers [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] also experimented with the possibilities of nonlinearity. Eisenstein's ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) and Dovzhenko's ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'' (1930) hint at a nonlinear experience.&lt;ref name="Dancyger"&gt;[[Ken Dancyger|Dancyger, Ken]] (2002).

=== Post-World War II ===
[[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s works since 1959 were also important in the evolution of nonlinear film. Godard famously stated, "I agree that a film should have a beginning, a middle and an end but not necessarily in that order".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,402858,00.html Godard only knows...]".

''Writing Your Screenplay''. Allen &amp; Unwin. pp. 114-117. {{ISBN|1-74114-083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Resnais]] experimented with narrative and time in his films ''[[Hiroshima mon amour]]'' (1959), ''[[L'Année dernière à Marienbad]]'' (1961), and ''[[Muriel (film)|Muriel]]'' (1963). [[Federico Fellini]] defined his own nonlinear cinema with the films ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960), ''[[8½]]'' (1963), ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]'' (1969), and ''[[Roma (1972 film)|Roma]]'' (1972), as did [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] with his [[modernist]] films ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975) and ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983). [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s films, including  ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' (1968), ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971), ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973), ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976), and ''[[Bad Timing]]'' (1980) are characterized by a nonlinear approach.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.learning.channel4.co.uk/film/reviews/feature.jsp?id=159039 Nicolas Roeg on Don't Look Now]".

In the United States, [[Robert Altman]] carried the nonlinear motif in his films, including ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2003).

[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]. p. 195. {{ISBN|0-7425-3289-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woody Allen]] embraced the experimental nature of nonlinear narrative in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' (1980).

===1990s and 2000s===
In the 1990s, [[Quentin Tarantino]] influenced a tremendous increase in the popularity of nonlinear films with ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="DancygerRush"/&gt; Other important nonlinear films include [[Atom Egoyan]]'s ''[[Exotica (film)|Exotica]]'' (1994), [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), and Karen and [[Jill Sprecher]]'s ''[[Thirteen Conversations About One Thing]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="DancygerRush"/&gt; [[David Lynch]] experimented with nonlinear narrative and [[surrealism]] in ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006).

In the years leading into and the beginning of the 21st century, some filmmakers have returned to the use of nonlinear narrative repeatedly, including [[Steven Soderbergh]] in ''[[Schizopolis]]'' (1996), ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999), ''[[Full Frontal (film)|Full Frontal]]'' (2002), ''[[Solaris (2002 film)|Solaris]]'' (2002), and ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]'' (2008); and [[Christopher Nolan]] in ''[[Following]]'' (1998), ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), and ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' (2017). ''Memento'', with its fragmentation and [[reverse chronology]], has been described as characteristic of moving towards [[postmodernism]] in contemporary cinema. Another example would be [[Terrence Malick]]'s acclaimed ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'' (2011). The element of reverse chronology was explored further in [[Gaspar Noé]]'s 2002 film ''[[Irréversible]]''. Noé's 2009 film [[Enter the Void]] also used an uncommon narrative structure as a man recalls his life through flashbacks at the time of his death, induced by the use of [[psychedelic drugs]].&lt;ref name="Nelmes"&gt;Nelmes, Jill (2003). ''An Introduction to Film Studies''.[[Routledge]]. p. 87. {{ISBN|0-415-26268-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Linklater]] used nonlinear narrative in ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' (1991), ''[[Waking Life]]'' (2001), and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006); [[Gus Van Sant]] in ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' (2003), ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'' (2005), and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' (2007). [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]'s film ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' is an example of fragmented narrative structure. Hong Kong auteur [[Wong Kar-wai]] explored nonlinear storylines in the films ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1991), ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' (1994), ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994), ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), and ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004). [[Fernando Meirelles]] in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' and ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]''. All of [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]'s films to date (aside from ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'') feature nonlinear narratives. [[Charlie Kaufman]] is also known for his fondness of nonlinear story-telling as applied in ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'' and ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. [[Takashi Shimizu]]'s Japanese horror series,  ''[[Ju-on]]'', brought to America as ''[[The Grudge]]'', is also nonlinear in its storytelling (the only exception being ''[[The Grudge 3]]''). Director [[Martin Koolhoven]] has made more movies with a nonlinear narrative, but the most notorious one is probably his controversial western ''[[Brimstone (2016 film)|Brimstone]]'', which premiered in the 2016 [[Venice Film Festival]].

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}

=== United States ===

In [[American television]], there are several examples of series that make use of nonlinear narrative in different forms and for different purposes. Some notable examples are ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', and ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]''. Even though it is often found in [[drama]], some [[comedy]] shows use nonlinear narrative too, such as ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' and ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''. This kind of narrative is used in several ways. Some series only have certain nonlinear episodes, such as ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' and ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]''. Others use nonlinear storylines throughout the whole series, such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''. Other series use nonlinear narrative in the beginning of a season and then explore the past until they meet, such as ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' and ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]''.

==== The past in certain episodes ====

Some television series use nonlinear narrative in certain episodes to fully explore an important part of the main characters' past. An example is [[Showtime Network|Showtime]]'s [[horror fiction|horror]] [[drama]] ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which features one episode per season that is entirely devoted to exploring key moments in Vanessa Ives' ([[Eva Green]]) past. Another example is [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s drama ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'', whose ninth episode is set in the past and explores the lives of the main characters before the critical event that drives the story took place. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[sci-fi]] series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] original [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'' and the [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix original]] [[comedy]] ''[[Grace and Frankie]]'' use this technique only in certain episodes too.

==== The future or past throughout the series ====

There are certain television series that use nonlinear narrative to explore the past - or future - of one or various characters throughout its whole run. The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' made extensive use of nonlinear story telling, with each episode typically featuring a primary storyline on the island as well as a secondary storyline from another point in a character's life, either past or future. So does [[The CW]]'s series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' which, in every episode, features a storyline following the life of [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]) stranded in an island and a main storyline five years later in which he goes back home and decides to become a [[vigilante]]. Using a similar storytelling technique, [[Netflix]]'s [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|original series]] ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' explores the lives of the main characters in prison and also some important part of their past before they became [[inmate]]s. Another example is [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s [[Horror film|horror]]-[[drama]] series ''[[The Strain (TV series)|The Strain]]''.

==== As a narrative hook ====

Some television series use nonlinear narrative in the beginning of a season as a [[narrative hook]], showing an intense or shocking event, and then extensively explore the past and the reasons that lead that event to happen. A notable example is the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] [[drama]] series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which in the beginning of its [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|final season]] showed a neglected and lonesome [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]) and then explored what had happened to him. This technique was also used in ''Breaking Bad'''s [[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|Pilot]] and in its [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|second season]]. Using the same formula, [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s [[Emmy Award]] winning legal drama ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' starring [[Glenn Close]], begins each season with an intensely melodramatic event taking place and then traveling back six months earlier. Throughout the season, each episode shows events both in the past, present, and future that lead up to and follow said event. [[Netflix]]'s [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|original series]] ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[crime drama]] ''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'' use a similar storytelling technique.

==== To mimic human memory ====

Another reason why a television series uses nonlinear narrative is to better portray the way human memory recalls events. In its [[True Detective (season 1)|first season]], the [[HBO]] [[anthology]] series ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'' used nonlinear narrative depicting the events that the main characters described and in the way they remembered them. [[Showtime Network|Showtime]]'s [[Golden Globes|Golden Globe]] winning [[drama]] ''[[The Affair (TV series)|The Affair]]'' uses this narrative technique in the same way. However, by using [[unreliable narrator]]s, this show emphasizes how differently two people recall the same events.

==== Other examples ====

In its [[The Walking Dead (season 4)|fourth]] and [[The Walking Dead (season 5)|fifth season]], [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s post-apocalypctic [[drama]] ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' used nonlinear narrative extensively.

Even though it is not common, some comedy also shows use nonlinear narrative. An example is the [[sitcom]] ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' which, in its [[Arrested Development (season 4)|fourth season]], made heavy use of nonlinear narrative, devoting each episode to explore the story of each of its characters separately.

Other examples of nonlinear narrative in American television are: ''[[12 Monkeys (TV series)|12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[A to Z (TV series)|A to Z]]'', ''[[Alcatraz (TV series)|Alcatraz]]'', ''[[American Horror Story]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', ''[[Marvel's Daredevil|Daredevil]]'', ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[FlashForward]]'', ''[[Forever (2014 TV series)|Forever]]'', ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', ''[[Grounded for Life]]'', ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'', ''[[The Returned (U.S. TV series)|The Returned]]'', ''[[Revolution (TV series)|Revolution]]'', ''[[Sense8]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[Wayward Pines (TV series)|Wayward Pines]]''.

=== Japan ===

Japanese [[anime]] series sometimes present their plot in nonlinear order. In ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'', for example, the episodes were deliberately aired in non-chronological order. A more nonlinear example is ''[[Baccano!]]'', where every scene is displayed in non-chronological order, with most scenes taking place at various times during the early 1930s and some scenes taking place before (extending back to the 18th century) and after (extending forward to the 21st century). Other examples include ''[[Durarara!!]]'', ''[[Monogatari (series)#(anime)|Monogatari Series]]'', ''[[Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito]]'', ''[[Touka Gettan]]'', ''[[Rental Magica]]'', ''[[Ergo Proxy]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]],'' ''[[Axis Powers Hetalia]]'', ''[[Hidamari Sketch]]'', ''[[Mekakucity Actors]]'' and (partly) ''[[Boogiepop Phantom]]''.

== Video games ==
{{main|Nonlinear gameplay}}
{{see also|Interactive narrative|Multiple endings}}

Some video games mimic film non-linearity by presenting a single plot in a chronologically distorted way instead of letting the player determine the story flow themselves. The [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Tribes: Vengeance]]'' is an example of this; another is Sega's ''[[Sonic Adventure]]''.

A nonlinear plot structure may or may not be combined with branching:

Some games tell their nonlinear story without the player being able to change any (or very little) of the plot structure. For example, ''[[Uncharted 2]]'' begins ''[[in medias res]]'', with the lead character in the aftermath of an accident that the player only reaches several hours of gameplay later.

Indie game ''[[Fragments of Him]]'' also begins ''[[in medias res]]'' but, in addition to the nonlinear beginning, it later jumps between characters to build the story and character relationships in a nonlinear fashion, and a subtle branch means that players may see the stories in a different order if they walk into a different room at the beginning.

Indie developers [[Dennaton Games]] use non-linear passages of time in their game [[Hotline Miami 2]] in the same way [[Pulp Fiction]] is written. For example, some segments of the game take place before the events of the Prequel. It is used for dramatic effect in most cases, some characters have already had onscreen deaths but the player will not realise it until a later chapter of the character walking blindly to their already shown death.

Often game developers use the idea of [[Amnesia|character amnesia]] in games. It helps give the game a beginning because the audience only has the understanding that there is a history before the events of the game take place. Furthermore, by creating a nonlinear storyline the complexity of game play is greatly expanded. Nonlinear game play allows for greater replay value, allowing the player to put together different pieces of a potentially puzzling storyline. A fitting example of character amnesia is the 2005 video game ''[[Façade (interactive story)|Façade]]''. In ''Façade'' the player is put into a situation that lasts approximately 10 to 15 minutes in real time, yet the events recalled seem to have a basis in years of dramatic history.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Sherol.

Web. 17 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/2009/08/nonlinear-storytelling-in-games-deconstructing-the-varieties-of-nonlinear-experiences/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== HTML narratives ==
In contemporary society webpages or to be more correct, hypertext, have become affluent forms of narratives. Hypertexts have great potential to create non-linear forms of narratives. They allow for individuals to navigate within the story through links, images, audio and video. An established hypertext narrative is Public Secret.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Sharon. "Public Secrets." Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular. Web. 18 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/4/publicsecrets/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Public Secret illustrates the reality of being incarcerated in California's Criminal Justice System. It brings to light the way inmates are treated. This functions as a non-linear narrative because it allows for its audience to witness through text and audio the reality of being a female inmate. However, there is no exact beginning or end as there are in comic books or video games. This website consists of multiple subtopics that do not force the audience to make their next selection based on what their previous experiences are.

The '''Pasporta Servo''' ({{lang-en|'''Passport Service'''}}) is a  [[hospitality service]] for [[Esperanto]] speakers. It is maintained by the [[World Esperanto Youth Organization]] (TEJO), which publishes an annual online and print directory of people within the [[Esperanto culture]] who are willing to host other Esperanto speakers in their [[residence]]s for free for up to 3 nights. The platform is a [[gift economy]]; hosts are not allowed to charge for [[lodging]].

Free lodging via Pasporta Servo is one of the benefits of learning [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=One of the Perks of Speaking Esperanto?

==History==
In 1966, psychologist [[Rubén Feldman González]] started the ''Programo Pasporto'', a hospitality service for Esperanto speakers, in [[Argentina]]. In 1974, under the guidance of [[Jeanne-Marie Cash]] in [[France]], the Pasporta Servo directory in its current form was first published, listing 40 hosts. Both founders are still hosts in the Pasporta Servo.

In August 2008, TEJO launched Pasporta Servo 2.0, an online version of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liberafolio.org/arkivo/www.liberafolio.org/2008/tejokomitato2008/ | title=TEJO reformas Pasportan Servon | work=[[Libera Folio]] | date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pluriculturalism''' is an approach to the self and others as complex rich beings which act and react from the perspective of multiple identifications. In this case, identity or identities are the by-products of experiences in different cultures.  As an effect, multiple identifications create a unique personality instead of or more than a static identity.&lt;ref name=Scribd&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/48131676/pluriculturalism-2 pluriculturalism (2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification.&lt;ref name=UGR&gt;Trujillo Sáez, Fernando. [http://www.ugr.es/~ftsaez/aspectos/LEA.pdf Culture Awareness and the development of the pluricultural competence], page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The term '''pluricultural competence''' is a consequence of the idea of [[plurilingualism]].&lt;ref name=COE&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/SourcePublications/CompetencePlurilingue09web_en.pdf 5.1.

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

{{Violence against women}}
'''''Raptio''''' (in [[Archaic English|archaic]] or [[literary English]] rendered as '''''rape''''') is a [[Latin]] term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. [[kidnapping]] for [[marriage]] or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The equivalent term '''''Frauenraub''''', originally from [[German language|German]], is used in English in the field of [[art history]].

[[Bride kidnapping]] is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.

{{Wiktionary|rape}}

==Terminology==
The English word ''rape'' retains the Latin meaning in [[literary language]], but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of "sexual violation". The word is akin to ''rapine'', ''[[rapture]]'', ''[[wikt:raptor|raptor]]'', ''rapacious'' and ''ravish'', and referred to the more general violations, such as [[looting]], destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during [[war]], e.g. the [[Rape of Nanking]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the definition "the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force" besides the more general "the act of taking anything by force" (marked as ''obsolete'') and the more specific "violation or ravishing of a woman".

English ''rape'' was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an [[Old French]] legal term for "to seize", in turn from [[Latin]] ''rapere'' "seize, carry off by force, abduct". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as "[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).

Though the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word "rape" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', the title means "the theft of a lock [of hair]", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the word with its old meaning of "seizing and taking away" in his ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]] ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' has [[The Fantasticks#Controversy|a controversial song]] ("It Depends on What You Pay") about "an old-fashioned rape". Compare also the adjective "rapacious" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of rape}}

The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the [[nubile]] females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122819/http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduction of women is a common practice in [[tribal warfare|warfare]] among [[tribal societies]], along with [[cattle raiding]]. In [[historical human migrations]], the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s compared to [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s. 
[[Image:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Rape of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], Rome, 1637-38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
The [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] is an important part of the [[Founding of Rome|foundation legends]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (8th century BC). [[Romulus]] had established the settlement on the [[Palatine Hill]] with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the [[Sabines]], without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. [[Livy]] claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, "and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html Livy: The Rape of the Sabines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311040505/http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer [[Saki]] in ''The Schartz-Metterklume Method''.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as the main plot of the movie [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'']].

In [[Sanskrit literature]], the practice is known as ''[[Rakshasa]] Vivaha'' ("devil marriage"), mentioned e.g. by [[Kautilya]]. It is one of the eight forms of [[Hindu marriage]], the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives ([[Manu Smrti]] 3.33).

In the 3rd century, [[Gothic Christianity]] appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the [[Goths]] in [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]]: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor [[Decius]], and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf, ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen'' (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam]] is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law]] ([[Sura 4]]:25).

Mutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the [[Balkans under Ottoman rule]], and is a frequent theme in the [[Hajduk]] songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. Simiczijev, ''Pieśń hajducka Słowian południowych'' ("the Hajduk songs of the South Slavs") 1985; review by Christo Vasilev, Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">'''Ritualcide''' is the systematic destruction or alteration of traditional ritual practices and their sequencing. Rituals have a prescribed form, source, and sequence that include sacred objects, places, times and seasons, music, dance, texts, songs and words, and mediators (such as monks, spirit mediums, religious leaders, and traditional healers). Ritualcide is not necessarily linked to [[genocide]], but ''genocidal priming''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=Alex|title=Why did they kill? : Cambodia in the shadow of genocide|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520241794|edition=2nd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may gain a handhold when regimes tamper with collective tradition and leave inhabitants vulnerable and/or susceptible to spirit-based harm and angst. Herein ancestral pathways for intimate connection are often disrupted.

The term ''ritualcide'' was coined by Peg LeVine in ''Love and Dread in Cambodia: Weddings, Births and Ritual Harm Under the Khmer Rouge,'' which emerged from an eight-year ethnographic study into ''Khmer Rouge weddings'' and Cambodian ritual history before, during and after Democratic Kampuchea. The definition was expanded in 2015 when LeVine continued research at the [[USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education|Shoah Foundation]], Center for Advanced Genocide Research. In October, 2016, ritualcide was introduced at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in conjunction with Khmer Rouge activity between 1975 and 1979; when LeVine gave expert witness, she suggested it was a "crime against culture". She has shown how ritual loss complicates the aftermath of trauma for the living and the dead, and ruptures the cosmological order that binds ancestors. Also, without access to reliable, traditional ritual sources, collective fear and vulnerability increase for survivors. In genocide and [[Holocaust]] studies, ritual restoration holds relevance for recovery by survivors and ancestors, and their collective sense of protection and cultural continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeVine|first1=Peg|title=Love and dread in Cambodia : weddings, births, and ritual harm under the Khmer Rouge|date=2010|publisher=NUS Press|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9971-69-472-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scrupulosity''' is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scrupulosity: A cognitive–behavioral analysis and implications for treatment|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914000116?via=sd|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Deacon B, Nelson EA |title=On the nature and treatment of scrupulosity |journal=Pragmatic Case Stud Psychother |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=39–53 |year=2008 |url=http://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/932/2329 |format=PDF |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v4i2.932}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this categorization is empirically disputable.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

The term is derived from the Latin ''scrupulum'', a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Miller-Hedges"&gt;{{vcite journal |author = Miller CH, Hedges DW|title = Scrupulosity disorder: an overview and introductory analysis|journal = J Anxiety Disord|volume = 22|issue = 6|pages = 1042–58|year = 2008|pmid = 18226490|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.11.004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scrupulosity was formerly called ''scruples'' in religious contexts, but the word ''[[Scruples (disambiguation)|scruples]]'' now commonly refers to a troubling of the [[conscience]] rather than to the disorder.

As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.4 Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/o-cpd.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "scrupulousness", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrupulous |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrupulous |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:JohnMooreBpOfEly.jpg|thumb|alt=Mezzotint portrait of a seated man in flowing vestments and long wavy hair. He is about 50 years old and with receding hairline and a calm expression on his roundish face. His left hand holds the armrest of his chair, and his right holds a fold of one of his robes on his chest.|[[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]] (shown {{circa|1691–1703}}) was the first to describe the disorder, calling it "religious melancholy".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor/&gt;]]

Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term ''scruples'' in a religious context, e.g. by [[Roman Catholic]]s, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi JW |date=1995 |title=The Doubting Disease: Help for Scrupulosity and Religious Compulsions |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-3553-1 |ref=Doubting }} Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Taylor CZ |title=Religious addiction: obsession with spirituality |journal=Pastoral Psych |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1023/A:1014074130084 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], wrote "After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws&amp;nbsp;... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned&amp;nbsp;... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy."&lt;ref name=van-Megen&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Obsessive compulsive disorder and religion: a reconnaissance |author=van Megen HJGM, den Boer-Wolters D, Verhagen PJ |pages=271–82 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]], the [[Redemptorists]]' founder, wrote of it as "groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Rose S |date=2007 |title=St. Ignatius Loyola And The Early Jesuits |isbn=1-4086-2255-6 |chapter=Manresa—the spiritual exercises—1523 |pages=45–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Alphonsus de Liguori |editor=Jones FM, editor and translator |date=1999 |title=Selected Writings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |chapter=Peace for scrupulous souls |pages=209–18 |isbn=0-8091-3771-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing "One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Monahan J |date=2003 |title=Thérèse of Lisieux |page=45 |isbn=0-8091-6710-7 |publisher=Paulist Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word ''enim'' ("for") during the [[Eucharist]] was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Aho JA |date=2005 |title=Confession and Bookkeeping: the Religious, Moral, and Rhetorical Roots of Modern Accounting |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |chapter=Martin Luther and scrupulosity |pages=95–8 |isbn=0-7914-6545-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and [[John Bunyan]] are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Cefalu P |title=The doubting disease: religious scrupulosity and obsessive–compulsive disorder in historical context |journal=J Med Humanit  |year=2010 |pmid=20127153 |doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], who called it "religious melancholy" and said it made people "fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |chapter=Religious experience and psychopathology |author=López-Ibor JJ Jr, López-Ibor Alcocer MI |pages=211–33 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor [[R.P. Duguet]], and other religious authorities and figures attempted to develop solutions and coping mechanisms;&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; the monthly newsletter ''[[Scrupulous Anonymous]]'', published by the followers of Liguori, has been used as an adjunct to therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi |title=[[#Doubting|The Doubting Disease]] |chapter=Getting help for scruples and OCD |pages=103–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Christian spiritual advisors in the U.S. and Britain became worried that scrupulosity was not only a sin in itself, but also led to sin, by attacking the virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25&amp;nbsp;per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.&lt;ref name=Bourke/&gt;

Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Bourke J |title=Divine madness: the dilemma of religious scruples in twentieth-century America and Britain |journal=J Soc Hist |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |date=2009 |doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This part needs more work.--&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.&lt;ref name=Huppert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Huppert JD, Siev J, Kushner ES |title=When religion and obsessive–compulsive disorder collide: treating scrupulosity in Ultra-Orthodox Jews |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=925–41 |date=2007 |pmid=17828763 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person [[Intrusive thought#Blasphemous religious thoughts|obsessed by blasphemous thoughts]] while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{vcite book |editor=Abramowitz JS, McKay D, Taylor S |title=Clinical Handbook of Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder and Related Problems |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8697-X |chapter=Scrupulosity |author=Abramowitz JS |pages=156–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 9781609180171|language = en|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. [[Cognitive therapy]] may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Although [[serotonergic]] medications are often used to treat OCD,&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |editor=McKay D, Storch EA, editors |date=2009 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Children: Treating Complex and Refractory Cases |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8261-1686-8 |author=McKay D, Storch EA, Nelson B, Morales M, Moretz MW |chapter=Obsessive–compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: treating difficult cases |pages=81–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The [[prevalence]] of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Available data suggest that the [[prevalence]] of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce.&lt;ref name=Huppert/&gt; There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=van-Megen/&gt;

== History and influence ==
Before [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] published the list in his weekly newspaper ''[[Young India]]'' on October 22, 1925,&lt;ref name=yi1925_10_22&gt;''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' (electronic edition), Vol. 33, pp. 133-134. {{ISBN|8123007353}}, {{ISBN|9788123007359}} {{OCLC|655798065}}&lt;/ref&gt; an almost identical list had been published six months earlier in England in a sermon at Westminster Abbey by Fredrick Lewis Donaldson.&lt;ref name="What are the Seven Social Sins?"&gt;[http://images.gr-assets.com/quotes/1435957881p8/32234.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;
Gandhi wrote that a correspondent whom he called a "fair friend" had sent the list: "The... fair friend wants readers of ''Young India'' to know, if they do not already, the following seven social sins,"&lt;ref name=yi1925_10_22/&gt; (the list was then provided). After the list, Gandhi wrote that "Naturally, the friend does not want the readers to know these things merely through the intellect but to know them through the heart so as to avoid them."&lt;ref name=yi1925_10_22/&gt; This was the entirety of Gandhi's commentary on the list when he first published it.

In the decades since its first publication, the list has been widely cited and discussed.

Some books have focused on the seven sins or been structured around them:

== Politics without principle ==
{{cleanup section|date=December 2011}}

Regarding "politics without principle", Gandhi said{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} having politics without truth(s) to justly dictate the action creates chaos, which ultimately leads to violence.  Gandhi called these missteps "passive violence," ‘which fuels the active violence of crime, rebellion, and war.’ He said, "We could work 'til doomsday to achieve peace and would get nowhere as long as we ignore passive violence in our world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meadows|first=Donella|title=Gandhi's Seven Blunders -- and then Some|url=http://www.sustainer.org/dhm_archive/index.php?display_article=vn552blundersed|work=The Donella Meadows Archive|accessdate=27 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704034811/http://www.sustainer.org/dhm_archive/index.php?display_article=vn552blundersed|archivedate=4 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politics]] is literally defined as, "The struggle in any group for power that will give one or more persons the ability to make decisions for the larger group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick H.|title=Essentials of Comparative Politics|year=2009|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohandas Gandhi defined [[principle]] as, "the expression of perfection, and as imperfect beings like us cannot practice perfection, we devise every moment limits of its compromise in practice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandhi|first=Mohandas|title=Inspired Words by Mohandas Gandhi|url=http://i-qte.com/mahatma-gandhi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different types of regimes in the world whose politics differ. Based on Gandhi’s Blunder '''Politics without Principle''', a [[regime]] type might be more of a root of violence than another because one regime has more '''principle''' than the other. Regimes have different types of fighting and aggression tactics, each desiring different outcomes.

This difference affects the actions taken by political heads in countries across the globe. Gandhi wrote, "An unjust law is itself a species of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandhi|first=Mohandas|url=http://quotationsbook.com/quote/22622/#axzz1QnsQmkyB|accessdate=27 June 2011|title=Quote - An unjust law is itself a species of violence. Arrest for its breach is more so...|work=Quotations Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggression of one country on another may be rooted in the government's creation of an unjust law. For example, a war of [[irredentism]] fought for one state to reclaim territory that was lost due to a law promoting [[ethnic cleansing]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Principle in one country could easily be a crime in another. This difference leads one to believe that the root of violence is inevitably present somewhere in the world. “Politics without Principle” will inevitably take place throughout time.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

: "I object to violence because when it appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandhi|first=Mohandas|url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/i_object_to_violence_because_when_it_appears_to/14281.html|accessdate=30 June 2011|title=Mahatma Gandhi quotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list grew from Gandhi's search for the roots of violence. He called these "acts of passive violence". Preventing these is the best way to prevent oneself or one's society from reaching a point of violence, according to Gandhi.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

To this list, Arun Gandhi added an eighth blunder, "rights without responsibilities".&lt;ref name="Arun Gandhi's article"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050308215331/http://www.gandhiinstitute.org/Library/LibraryItem.cfm?LibraryID=780 Arun Gandhi's article]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arun Gandhi, the idea behind the first blunder originates from the feudal practice of [[Zamindari]]. He also suggests that the first and the second blunders are interrelated.

{{Sociology}}
A '''society''' is a [[Social group|group]] of individuals involved in persistent [[Social relation|social interaction]], or a large [[social group]] sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same [[Politics|political]] authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships ([[social relation]]s) between individuals who share a distinctive [[culture]] and [[institutions]]; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. In the [[social science]]s, a larger society often exhibits [[social stratification|stratification]] or [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] patterns in subgroups.

Insofar as it is [[collaborative]], a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a [[subculture]], a term used extensively within [[criminology]].

More broadly, and especially within [[Structuralism|structuralist thought]], a society may be illustrated as an [[economic]], social, [[Industry|industrial]] or [[culture|cultural]] [[infrastructure]], made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than "other people" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.

==Etymology and usage==

{{wide image|Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 1.jpg|700px|A half-section of the 12th-century [[South Tang Dynasty]] version of ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'', original by [[Gu Hongzhong]]. The painting portrays servants, musicians, monks, children, guests, and hosts all in a single social environment. It serves as an in-depth look into the Chinese social structure of the time.}}

The term "society" came from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Wikt:societas|societas]]'', which in turn was derived from the noun ''socius'' ("[[comrade]], friend, ally"; adjectival form ''socialis'') used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil. Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: "society in general", "society at large", etc.), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be "antisocial". However, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] economist, [[Adam Smith]] taught instead that a society "may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its [[utility]] without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other."&lt;ref name=Briggs9/&gt;

Used in the sense of an [[Voluntary association|association]], a society is a body of individuals outlined by the bounds of functional [[interdependence]], possibly comprising characteristics such as [[national identity|national]] or [[cultural identity]], [[social solidarity]], [[language]], or [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]].

==Conceptions==
Society, in general, addresses the fact that an individual has rather limited means as an [[autonomy|autonomous unit]]. The [[great apes]] have always been more (''[[Bonobo]]'', ''[[Human being|Homo]]'', ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'') or less (''[[Gorilla]]'', ''[[Orangutan|Pongo]]'') [[social animal]]s, so [[Robinson Crusoe]]-like situations are either fictions or unusual [[corner case]]s to the ubiquity of social context for humans, who fall between [[presocial]] and [[eusociality|eusocial]] in the spectrum of [[primate#Social systems|animal ethology]].

[[Cultural relativism]] as a widespread approach or ethic has largely replaced notions of "primitive", better/worse, or "progress" in relation to cultures (including their material culture/technology and social organization).

According to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], one critical novelty in society, in contrast to humanity's closest biological relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos), is the parental role assumed by the males, which supposedly would be absent in our nearest relatives for whom paternity is not generally determinable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|publisher=''New Left Review''|author=Jack Goody|title=The Labyrinth of Kinship|accessdate=24 July 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004209/http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In political science ===
Societies may also be structured [[politics|politically]]. In order of increasing size and complexity, there are [[band society|bands]], [[tribe]]s, [[chiefdom]]s, and [[State (polity)|state]] societies. These structures may have varying degrees of [[political power]], depending on the [[culture|cultural]], [[geography|geographical]], and [[history|historical]] environments that these societies must contend with. Thus, a more isolated society with the same level of technology and culture as other societies is more likely to survive than one in closer proximity to others that may encroach on their resources. A society that is unable to offer an effective response to other societies it competes with will usually be subsumed into the culture of the competing society.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Peter L. Berger]] defines society as "...a human product, and nothing but a human product, that yet continuously acts upon its producers."  According to him, society was created by humans but this creation turns back and creates or molds humans every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Scared Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion|last = Berger|first = Peter L.|publisher = Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|year = 1967|isbn = |location = Garden City, NYC|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right|''Canis lupus'' [[Ethology|social ethology]]]]

Sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (e.g. fishing societies or maritime societies).&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, G. 1974. ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology.''&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the system earlier developed by anthropologists Morton H. Fried, a conflict theorist, and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, who have produced a system of classification for societies in all human cultures based on the evolution of [[social inequality]] and the role of the [[State (polity)|state]]. This system of classification contains four categories:
* [[Hunter-gatherer]] bands (categorization of duties and responsibilities).
* [[Tribe|Tribal]] societies in which there are some limited instances of [[social rank]] and prestige.
* [[Social stratification|Stratified]] structures led by [[tribal chief|chieftains]].
* [[Civilization]]s, with complex social hierarchies and organized, [[government|institutional governments]].

In addition to this there are:
* [[All humanity|Humanity]], humankind, upon which rest all the elements of society, including society's beliefs.
* [[Sociology of the Internet|Virtual society]], a society based on online identity, which is evolving in the information age.

Over time, some [[cultures]] have progressed toward more complex forms of [[organization]] and control. This [[cultural evolution]] has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes settled around seasonal food stocks to become [[Neolithic Revolution|agrarian villages]]. Villages grew to become towns and cities. Cities turned into [[city-state]]s and [[nation-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Effland, R. 1998. [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html The Cultural Evolution of Civilizations] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515120848/http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/glues/model_complex.html |date=15 May 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies distribute largess at the behest of some individual or some larger group of people. This type of generosity can be seen in all known cultures; typically, prestige accrues to the generous individual or group. Conversely, members of a society may also shun or [[scapegoat]] members of the society who violate its [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Mechanisms such as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|gift-giving]], [[joking relationship]]s and [[scapegoating]], which may be seen in various types of human groupings, tend to be [[institution]]alized within a society. Social evolution as a phenomenon carries with it certain elements that could be detrimental to the population it serves.

Some societies bestow status on an individual or group of people when that individual or group performs an admired or desired action. This type of [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] is bestowed in the form of a name, title, manner of dress, or monetary reward. In many societies, adult male or female status is subject to a ritual or process of this type. Altruistic action in the interests of the larger group is seen in virtually all societies. The phenomena of community action, shunning, scapegoating, generosity, shared risk, and reward are common to many forms of society.

==Types==
Societies are [[social groups]] that differ according to [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], the ways that humans use technology to provide needs for themselves. Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history, anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige, or power. Virtually all societies have developed some degree of inequality among their people through the process of social stratification, the division of members of a society into levels with unequal wealth, prestige, or power. Sociologists place societies in three broad categories: [[pre-industrial]], [[industrial society|industrial]], and [[postindustrial]].

===Pre-industrial===
{{Main article|Pre-industrial society}}

In a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal [[Manual labour|labor]], is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, agricultural, and feudal.

==== Hunting and gathering ====
{{Main article|Hunter-gatherer society}}
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] in Botswana start a fire by hand.]]
The main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent [[villages]] or create a wide variety of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and usually only form small groups such as [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s. However, some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources (such as people of [[Tlingit people|tlingit]]) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies. They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100. Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal, and decisions are reached through general agreement. The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands. [[Leadership]] is personal—charismatic—and used for special purposes only in tribal society. There are no political offices containing real power, and a [[Tribal chief|chief]] is merely a person of influence, a sort of adviser; therefore, tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental. The family forms the main [[social unit]], with most members being related by birth or marriage. This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions, including [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and [[education]].

==== Pastoral ====
{{Main article|Pastoral society}}

[[Pastoralism]] is a slightly more efficient form of subsistence. Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Because their food supply is far more reliable, pastoral societies can support larger populations. Since there are food surpluses, fewer people are needed to produce food. As a result, the division of labor (the specialization by individuals or groups in the performance of specific economic activities) becomes more complex. For example, some people become craftworkers, producing [[tools]], [[weapons]], and [[jewelry]]. The production of goods encourages trade. This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do. These families often gain power through their increased [[wealth]]. The passing on of property from one generation to another helps to centralize wealth and power. Over time emerge hereditary chieftainships, the typical form of [[government]] in pastoral societies.

==== Horticultural ====
{{Main article|Horticulturalist society}}

Fruits and vegetables grown in garden plots that have been cleared from the jungle or forest provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a level of [[technology]] and complexity similar to pastoral societies. Some horticultural groups use the slash-and-burn method to raise crops. The wild vegetation is cut and burned, and ashes are used as fertilizers. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a fairly long period of time. This allows them to build semipermanent or permanent villages. The size of a village's population depends on the amount of land available for farming; thus villages can range from as few as 30 people to as many as 2000.

As with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, [[shamans]] (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows people to create a wide variety of artifacts. As in pastoral societies, surplus food can lead to inequalities in wealth and power within horticultural political systems, developed because of the settled nature of horticultural life.

==== Agrarian ====
{{Main article|Agrarian society}}
[[File:Detail of Les tres riches heures - March.jpg|thumb|Ploughing with oxen in the 15th century]]
Agrarian societies use agricultural [[technological]] advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Sociologists use the phrase [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]] to refer to the technological changes that occurred as long as 8,500 years ago that led to cultivating crops and raising farm animals. Increases in food supplies then led to larger populations than in earlier communities. This meant a greater surplus, which resulted in towns that became centers of trade supporting various rulers, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious leaders who did not have to worry about locating nourishment.

Greater degrees of social stratification appeared in agrarian societies. For example, women previously had higher social status because they shared labor more equally with men. In hunting and gathering societies, women even gathered more food than men. However, as food stores improved and women took on lesser roles in providing food for the family, they increasingly became subordinate to men. As villages and towns expanded into neighboring areas, conflicts with other communities inevitably occurred. Farmers provided warriors with food in [[Trade|exchange]] for protection against invasion by enemies. A system of rulers with high social status also appeared. This nobility organized warriors to protect the society from invasion. In this way, the nobility managed to extract goods from “lesser” members of society.

[[File:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Cleric, knight and peasant; an example of feudal societies]]

==== Feudal ====
{{Main article|Feudal society}}

[[Feudalism]] was a form of society based on ownership of land. Unlike today's farmers, vassals under feudalism were bound to cultivating their lord's land. In exchange for military protection, the lords exploited the peasants into providing food, crops, crafts, homage, and other services to the landowner. The [[estates of the realm]] system of feudalism was often multigenerational; the families of peasants may have cultivated their lord's land for generations.

===Industrial===
{{main article|Industrial societies}}

Between the 15th and 16th centuries, a new economic system emerged that began to replace feudalism. [[Capitalism]] is marked by open competition in a free market, in which the means of production are privately owned. Europe's exploration of the Americas served as one impetus for the development of capitalism. The introduction of foreign metals, silks, and spices stimulated great commercial activity in European societies.

Industrial societies rely heavily on machines powered by fuels for the production of goods. This produced further dramatic increases in efficiency. The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before. Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured goods. This larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.

Once again, the population boomed. Increased productivity made more goods available to everyone. However, inequality became even greater than before. The breakup of agricultural-based feudal societies caused many people to leave the land and seek employment in cities. This created a great surplus of labor and gave capitalists plenty of laborers who could be hired for extremely low wages.

===Post-industrial===
{{main article|Post-industrial society}}
Post-industrial societies are societies dominated by information, services, and high technology more than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies are now seeing a shift toward an increase in service sectors over manufacturing and production. The United States is the first country to have over half of its work force employed in service industries. Service industries include government, research, education, health, sales, law, and banking.

==Contemporary usage==
The term "society" is currently used to cover both a number of political and scientific connotations as well as a variety of associations.

===Western===
{{Main article|Western world}}
The development of the [[Western world]] has brought with it the emerging concepts of [[Western culture]], politics, and ideas, often referred to simply as "Western society". Geographically, it covers at the very least the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It sometimes also includes Eastern Europe, South America, and Israel.

The cultures and lifestyles of all of these stem from Western Europe. They all enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, allow freedom of religion, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favor capitalism and international trade, are heavily influenced by [[Judeo-Christian values]], and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/Products/title.aspx?pid=355705 John P McKay, Bennett D Hill, John Buckler, Clare Haru Crowston and Merry E Wiesner-Hanks: ''Western Society: A Brief History''.

{{Main article|Information society}}
Although the concept of [[information society]] has been under discussion since the 1930s, in the modern world it is almost always applied to the manner in which information technologies have impacted society and culture. It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~tisj/ ''The Information Society''.

One of the [[European Union]]'s areas of interest is the information society. Here policies are directed towards promoting an open and competitive [[digital economy]], research into [[information and communication technologies]], as well as their application to improve [[social inclusion]], [[public services]], and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/tl/policy/index_en.htm Information Society Policies at a Glance.

The [[International Telecommunications Union]]'s [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Geneva and Tunis (2003 and 2005) has led to a number of policy and application areas where action is envisaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/implementation/index.html WSIS Implementation by Action Line.

===Knowledge===
{{Main article|Knowledge society}}
[[File:Seoul-Cyworld control room.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Seoul [[Cyworld]] control room]]
As access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society. An analysis by the Irish government stated, "The capacity to manipulate, store and transmit large quantities of information cheaply has increased at a staggering rate over recent years. The digitisation of information and the associated pervasiveness of the Internet are facilitating a new intensity in the application of knowledge to economic activity, to the extent that it has become the predominant factor in the creation of wealth. As much as 70 to 80 percent of economic growth is now said to be due to new and better knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf ''Building the Knowledge Society.

People of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions, beliefs, or values are sometimes also said to form a society (such as Judeo-Christian, Eastern, and Western). When used in this context, the term is employed as a means of contrasting two or more "societies" whose members represent alternative conflicting and competing worldviews.

Some [[academic]], professional, and [[scientific societies|scientific]] [[Voluntary association|associations]] describe themselves as ''societies'' (for example, the [[American Mathematical Society]], the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], or the [[Royal Society]]).

In some countries, e.g. the United States, France, and Latin America, the term "society' is used in [[commerce]] to denote a partnership between [[investor]]s or the start of a [[business]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], partnerships are not called societies, but [[cooperative|co-operatives]] or [[Mutual organization|mutuals]] are often known as societies (such as [[friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[building society|building societies]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8508">'''T.J. Demos''' is an [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Cultural criticism|cultural critic]] who writes on [[contemporary art]] and [[visual culture]], particularly in relation to [[globalization]], [[politics]], [[Human migration|migration]] and [[ecology]]. Currently a Professor in the Department of History of Art and Visual Culture (HAVC) at UC Santa Cruz, and the founding director of the Center for Creative Ecologies, he is the author of several books, including ''Decolonizing Nature: Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology'' (Sternberg Press, 2016),
''The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary during Global Crisis'' (Duke University Press, 2013), and ''Return to the Postcolony: Spectres of Colonialism in Contemporary Art'' (Sternberg Press, 2013).  Previous to his current appointment, Demos taught at University College London between 2005-2015. 

Demos has also curated a number of art exhibitions, including ''Rights of Nature: Art and Ecology in the Americas''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/art/rights-nature/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 and ''Uneven Geographies: Art and Globalisation''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/art/uneven-geographies/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, both at Nottingham Contemporary (both co-curated with Alex Farqharson); ''Specters: A Cinema of Haunting''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/activities/spectres-cinema/&lt;/ref&gt; at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2014; and ''Zones of Conflict'', at Pratt Manhattan Gallery in New York in 2008.

==Education and career==

Demos received his PhD in 2000 from Columbia University. His first book, which emerged from his doctoral thesis, was ''The Exiles of Marcel Duchamp'' (MIT Press, 2007). It situates Duchamp’s mixed-media projects, such as ''La Boîte-en-valise'', and his installations, including the 1938 Surrealist exhibition in Paris, in the context of the early twentieth century’s world wars and nationalist formations. The text argues that Duchamp’s practice brought about an aesthetic negotiation of the experiences of geopolitical dislocation.

==Writing==

Demos’ work focuses on the intersection of contemporary art and politics (particularly in the areas of photography and moving-image art), and considers the ways that art is capable of inventing creative and critical approaches that analyze, defy, and provide alternatives to reigning political, social, and economic forms of neoliberal globalization. His recent writing investigates contemporary art’s relation to environmental crisis, and he recently guest-edited a special issue of the journal ''Third Text'' on "Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology" (no. 120, January 2013), and has written several essays on the subject, such as “The Post-Natural Condition” in ''Artforum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Post-Natural Condition|url=http://tomorrowmorning.net/texts/demos_artafternature_artforum.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary during Global Crisis''===
This book looks at contemporary artists who have turned to documentary practice in order to investigate the mobile lives of migrants, refugees, stateless persons, and the politically dispossessed. His analysis considers the work of artists from Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and North Africa, which portrays the frequently negative conditions of neoliberal globalization, and which connects viewers to the lived experiences of economic and political crisis. The text includes close readings of works by Steve McQueen, The Otolith Group, Emily Jacir, Hito Steyerl Ahlam Shibli, Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, Ursula Biemann, Lamia Joreige, Rabih Mroué, Walid Raad, Yto Barrada, Ayreen Anastas and Rene Gabri, Goldin+Senneby. It argues that these artists propose innovative ways to approach a politics of social justice and equality, and historical consciousness, even while operating in an aesthetic domain that is post-representational and deterritorialized.

===''Return to the Postcolony: Specters of Colonialism in Contemporary Art''===
This text examines the video and photographic projects by Sven Augustijnen, Vincent Meessen, Zarina Bhimji, Renzo Martens, and Pieter Hugo. The book traces the work of these artists who have each travelled to former European colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years in order to investigate past and present traumas and injustices, resulting in projects that were also made around the time of the 50th anniversary of the independence of numerous African countries. Addressing the larger context of failed states, increasing socio-political and economic inequality, and the continuing US-led military campaigns for security, resources, and economic supremacy worldwide, the book contends that artists today are critically investigating the aesthetics and image systems of neoliberalism and global crisis. Arguing that the past colonial experience continues to haunt those living in the present, but lies repressed, the book considers these artists’ voyages as constituting a “reverse migration,” a return to the African postcolony, “which drives an ethico-political as well as an aesthetic set of imperatives: to learn to live with ghosts, but to do so more justly.” (back cover).

===''Dara Birnbaum: Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman''===
Demos reads Birnbaum's video art in relation to media theory, postmodernist appropriation aesthetics, and the politics of feminism, and considers the pioneering attempts of the artist to develop the transformative capabilities of the medium of video.

===''The Exiles of Marcel Duchamp''===
Demos' text analyses the artist’s installations and conceptual mixed-media pieces – such as his La Boîte-en-valise, which Duchamp called his “portable museum.” The book places these project in relation to the aesthetic and geopolitical dislocations of early twentieth-century nationalisms and world war.

== Recognition ==
In 2014, Demos was awarded the prestigious [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/2014awards|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=14 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116070852/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/2014awards|archivedate=16 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribes are divided into [[clan]]s, with their own customs and [[cultural values]] that differentiate them from activities that occur in 'real life' contexts. People feel more inclined to share and defend their [[idea]]s on [[social network]]s than they would dare to say to someone face to face. For example, it would be ridiculous to '[[Poke (Facebook)|poke]]' someone in real life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning with 'e's: Global digital tribe|url = http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/global-digital-tribe.html|website = steve-wheeler.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "[[tribe]]" originated around the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states and the early formation of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin]] term "tribus" has since been transformed to mean "''A group of persons forming a [[community]] and claiming descent from a common [[ancestor]]''" (Oxford English Dictionary, IX, 1933, p.&amp;nbsp;339, as cited in Fried, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;7). As years passed by, the range of meanings have grown greater, for example, "''Any of various systems of [[social organization]] comprising several local [[village]]s, [[Tribe (Native American)|band]]s, [[districts]], lineages, or other groups and sharing a common [[Ancestor|ancestry]], [[language]], [[culture]], and [[name]]''" (Morris, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;1369). Morris (1980) also notes that a [[tribe]] is a "''group of persons with a common occupation, interest, or [[habit]],''" and "''a large family.''"&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Vestiges of ancient tribe communities were preserved in both large gatherings (like [[football]] matches) and in small ones (like [[Church (building)|church]] [[Community|communities]]). Even though nowadays the range of groups referred to as tribal is truly enormous, it wasn't until the [[industrial society]] eroded the tribal gatherings of more primitive societies and redefined [[community]]. However, the existence of [[social media]] as we know it today is due to the [[post-industrial society]] that has seen the rapid growth of [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[Internet|the Internet]]. People now can [[Collaboration|collaborate]], [[Communication|communicate]], celebrate, commemorate, give their advice and share their ideas around these virtual clans that have once again redefined the [[Social behavior|social behaviour]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The first attempt of such social [[Community|communities]] dates back to at least 2003, when [[tribe.net]] was launched.

=== tribe.net starting point ===
Tribe Networks is the driving force behind [[tribe.net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = tribe.net|url = http://www.tribe.com/|website = tribe.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[website]] similar to other [[Social networking websites|social networking]] sites. Users can create their own profiles and join networks, called 'tribes', based on common interests. Moreover, members can post job offers and event recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why did tribe.net (Mark Pincus) not work out? - Quora|url = https://www.quora.com/Why-did-tribe.net-(Mark-Pincus)-not-work-out|website = www.quora.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribe serves 50 metropolitan [[market (place)|market]]s, its largest being the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New York City]]. The firm was found in July 2003 by [[Mark Pincus]], Paul Martino and Valerie Syme, with the goal of connecting local people for what Pincus described as "''an online cocktail party where people are getting leads through their friends. So people are there to have fun and connect and meet new people.''" Soon the site caught the attention of [[Knight Ridder]], The Washington Post Company and blue chip venture firm Mayfield, which both totally invested around $6.3 million in [[venture capital]]. After three months of activity, Tribe brought together 48,000 registered users and 6,900 distinct tribes, earning revenue from job postings and class fields.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Vault Guide to the Top Internet Industry Employers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPjwN9_FmkYC|publisher = Vault Inc.|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9781581313840|first = Laurie|last = Pasiuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribes from a technical perspective ==
Not only do [[Twitter]] tribes have mutual interests,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The rise of the Twitter tribes|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/02/twitter-tribes-lady-gaga-rihanna|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Michael|last = Cragg}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also share potentially [[subconscious]] [[language]] features as found in the 2013 study by researchers from [[Royal Holloway University of London]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Dr. John Bryden from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway states that it is possible to anticipate which community somebody is likely to belong to,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which Twitter tribe are you? Researchers discover new wave of online communities which even have their own languages|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2293912/Twitters-online-tribes-revealed-Users-forming-distinct-communities-languages-study-shows.html|website = Mail Online|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 80 percent accuracy. This research shows that people try to join [[Society|societies]] based on the same interests and [[Hobby|hobbies]]. In order to achieve this, publicly available messages were sent via Twitter to record conversations between two or more participants. As a result, each community can be characterised by their most used words. This approach can enrich new communities detection based on word analysis in order to automatically classify people inside [[social network]]s. The methods of identification of tribes relied heavily on [[algorithm]]s and techniques from [[statistical physics]], [[computational biology]] and [[network science]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter|url = http://www.epjdatascience.com/content/2/1/3|journal = EPJ Data Science|date = 2013-02-25|issn = 2193-1127|pages = 3|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1140/epjds15|first = John|last = Bryden|first2 = Sebastian|last2 = Funk|first3 = Vincent AA|last3 = Jansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter users forming tribes with own language, tweet analysis shows|url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/twitter-users-tribes-language-analysis-tweets|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-31|first = Jason|last = Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = People with same interests or occupation form 'tribes' on Twitter {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url = http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-people-with-same-interests-or-occupation-form-tribes-on-twitter-1811627|website = dna|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ickn.org/documents/Tribefinder_COINs18.pdf|title=Identifying Tribes on Twitter through Shared Context|last=Gloor|first=P.|last2=Fronzetti Colladon|first2=A.|date=|website=ICKN Intelligent Collaborative Knowledge Networks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11|last3=de Oliveira|first3=J.|last4=Rovelli|first4=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is taken by Tribefinder.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system is able to identify tribal affiliations of [[Twitter]] users using [[deep learning]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The system establishes to which tribes individuals belong through the analysis of their tweets and the comparison of their [[vocabulary]]. These tribal vocabularies are previously generated based on the vocabulary of tribal influencers and leaders using keywords expressing concepts, ideas and beliefs. 

The final step to make the system learn on how to associate random individuals with specific tribes consists of the analysis of the language these influential tribal leaders use through deep learning. In so doing, classifiers are created using embedding and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] (long short-term memory) models. Specifically, these classifiers work by collecting the Twitter feeds of all the users from the tribes that Tribefinder is training on. On these, [[embedding]] is applied to map words into vectors, which are then used as input for the following LSTM models. Tribefinder analyzes the individual’s word usage in their tweets and then assigns the corresponding alternative realities, lifestyle, and recreation tribal affiliation based on the similarities with the specific tribal vocabularies. 

== An in-depth look into the research ==
The research had four main stages on which it focused: background, results, conclusions and methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Background ===
The [[language]] is a system of [[communication]] consisting of [[phoneme|sounds]], words, and [[grammar]], or the system of [[communication]] used by people in a particular [[country]] or type of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = language Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/language|website = dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is perhaps the most important characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M.A, Jansen, V.A.A., and Plotkin, J.B 2000. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v404/n6777/abs/404495a0.html] Nature, 404, pp.495-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has a wide range of social implications that can be associated with [[Social group|social or cultural groups]]. People usually group in communities with the same interests. This will result in a variation of the words they use because of the differentiation of terms from each domain. Therefore, the [[Hypothesis of a theorem|hypothesis]] of this study would be that this variation should closely match the community structure of the [[Social network|network]]. To test this theory, around 250,000 users from the [[List of social networking websites|social networking]] and [[microblogging]] site Twitter were monitored in order to analyse whether the groups identified had the same language features or not. As Twitter uses unstructured data and users can send messages to any other users, the study had to be based on complex algorithms. These algorithms had to determine the word frequency inside messages between people and make a link to the groups they usually visited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Results and discussion ===
[[File:Word usage based tribes on Twitter, Bryden et al.png|thumb|517x517px|Communication between and within tribes of [[Twitter]] users [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] based on word usage. '''Tribes''' tend to communicate more within than between themselves.]]
The problem of detecting the community features is one of the main issues in the study of networking systems. [[Social network]]s naturally tend to divide themselves into communities or [[modules]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modularity and community structure in networks|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2006-06-06|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1482622|pmid = 16723398|pages = 8577–8582|volume = 103|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0601602103|first = M. E. J.|last = Newman|arxiv = physics/0602124|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.8577N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some world networks are too big so they must be simplified before information can be extracted.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = mapequation.org - publications|url = http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html|website = www.mapequation.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an effective way of dealing with this drawback for smaller communities is by using ''[[Modularity (programming)|modularity]]'' [[algorithm]]s in order to partition users into even smaller [[Social group|groups]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For larger ones, a more efficient algorithm called 'map equation' decomposes a [[Network topology|network]] into [[Modularity|modules]] by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each community was therefore characterised according to the words they used the most, based on a ranking algorithm. To determine the significance of word usage differences, word endings and word lengths were also measured and showed that the [[pattern]] found was the correct one. Moreover, these studies also helped in predicting community membership of users, by comparing their own word frequencies with community word usage. This helped in forecasting which community a certain user is going to access based on the words that they are using.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Proportion of users whose community is correctly predicted.png|thumb|The proportion of users whose topological community association is correctly predicted by the study.|700x700px|none]]

=== Conclusions ===
[[File:An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.png|thumb|An illustration of the method for predicting which community a user is embedded in.|333x333px]]
The aim of this research was to study the bond between community structure in a social network environment and language use within the community . The striking pattern that was found suggests that people from different clans tend to use different words based on their own interests and hobbies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This study can show how people make friends based on the same [[vocabulary]] range that they use.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Even though this approach didn't manage to cover all people inside Twitter, it has several advantages over ordinary surveys that cover a smaller scale of groups: it is systematic, it is non-intrusive and it easily produces large volumes of rich [[data]]. Moreover, other cultural characteristics can be found out when extending this study. For example, whether individuals that belong to multiple communities use different word sets in each of them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methods ===
A process called [[Snowball sampling|snowball-sampling]] helped forming the sample [[Network topology|network]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network Twitter - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds15/fulltext.html|doi = 10.1140/epjds15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each user's [[Twitter|tweets]] and messages were recorded and any new users referenced were added to a list from where they were picked to be sampled. Messages that were copies have been ignored. In order to find out the words that characterise each clan, the fraction of people that use a certain word was compared with the fraction of people that use that word globally. The difference between communities has also been measured by comparing the relative word usage frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Last but not least, individual word usage was compared with each community word usage to pick the best matching clan for individual users.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Different language misspellings within tribes ==
[[Word]]s, and the way we [[Spelling|spell]] them are in a continuous change, as we find new ways to communicate. Despite the fact that traditional [[Dictionary|dictionaries]] don't take into account the changes, online ones have adopted many of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Misspellings show language's evolution, but does that mean they're OK for journalists to use? {{!}} Poynter.|url = http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/161298/misspellings-show-languages-evolution-but-does-that-mean-theyre-ok-for-journalists-to-use/|website = www.poynter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting fact outlined in the research above is that communities tend to use their own misspelt words. According to Professor Vincent Jansen from [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway]] communities would misspell words in different ways, just as people have different regional [[Diacritic|accents]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, [[Justin Bieber]] fans tend to end words in ''"ee"'' as in ''"pleasee"'', while school teachers tend to use long words. Moreover, the largest group found in the study was composed of [[African American]]s who were using the words ''"[[nigga]]"'', ''"poppin"'', and ''"chillin"''. Members of this community also had the common habit of shortening the ends of the words, replacing ''"ing"'' with ''"in"'' and ''"er"'' with ''"a"''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== The campfire ==
Each tribe has an [[Electronic trading platform|online-platform]] (such as [[Flickr]] or [[Tumblr]]), called campfire around which they gather. These campfires tend to enable one or more of the following three tribal activities:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* [[Cooperation]] (e.g. [[Wikipedia]])
* [[Communication]] (e.g. [[Social network]]s)
* [[Cognition]] (e.g. [[Blogs]])
However, some brands are building their own tribes around [[Platforms (computing)|platforms]] outside of these.

== Cooperation ==
[[Cooperation]] is the action of working together to the same end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cooperation - definition of cooperation in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cooperation|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. [[Collaborative software|Groupware]] systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal [[communication]] predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. [[Collaboration]] and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Software Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_SklFgSidxQC|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2009-03-31|isbn = 9781605660615|first = Tiako, Pierre|last = F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is groupware? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchdomino.techtarget.com/definition/groupware|website = SearchDomino|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupware can be split into three categories: '''communication''', '''collaboration''' and '''coordination''', depending on the level of cooperation and technology involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Groupware: Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.
[[File:Wikipedia-logo-v2-en.svg|thumb|The logo of Wikipedia]]

=== Wikipedia ===
[[Wikipedia]] is a [[Collaborative real-time editor|collaborative software]] because anyone can edit it. You can edit articles, view past revisions and discuss through a forum the current state of each article. Due to the fact that anyone can change it and find [[information]] very quickly, it has become one of the 10 most accessed sites on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Advantages ====
Wikipedia has many advantages over other encyclopedias:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using the Web to Get Stuff Done: What is Wikipedia?|url = http://www.gcflearnfree.org/using-the-web-to-get-stuff-done/what-is-wikipedia|website = GCFLearnFree.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Advantages and Disadvantages Of Using Wikipedia For Research  - Youth Village|url = http://www.youthvillage.co.za/2014/10/advantages-disadvantages-using-wikipedia-research/|website = Youth Village|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It's free and open for anyone on the Internet;
* All past edits and chats from the forum are public and everyone can see them;
* Updates happen frequently;
* It contains millions of articles;
* Easy to use and learn;

==== Disadvantages ====
However, there are also some drawbacks:&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Information can be inaccurate;
* It is open to [[Spamming|spam]] and [[vandalism]];
* Some articles can contain omissions and be hard to understand;
* It can be too open sometimes (for [[Confidentiality|confidential]] documentation);
* It requires Internet connectivity.

== Communication ==
[[Communication]] is the act or an instance of communicating; the imparting or exchange of [[information]], [[idea]]s, or [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "communication" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/communication|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication has drastically changed over time and [[social network]]s have changed the way people [[Communication|communicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.solari.net/documents/position-papers/Solari-Social-Media-and-Communication.pdf|title = Social Media and Its Effect on Communication|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://www.solari.net/|publisher = Solari Communication|last = Maggiani|first = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though people]can interact with each other 24/7, there is a new wave of barriers and [[threat]]s. In the [[workplace]] environment, electronic Communication has overtaken face-to-face and voice-to-voice Communication by far. This major shift has been done in advantage of [[Millennials|Generation Y]], who prefer [[instant messaging]] than talking directly to someone. It is often said that it could become an ironic twist, but [[social media]] has the real potential of making us less social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Social Media Sabotaging Real Communication?|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/susantardanico/2012/04/30/is-social-media-sabotaging-real-communication/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are studies that confirm that people are becoming more social, but the style in which they interact with each other has changed a lot. One of the major drawbacks of social networks is [[privacy]], as people tend to trust others more rapidly and send more open [[message]]s about themselves. As a result, personal information can be easily exposed to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media and Interpersonal Communication|url = http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/051313p10.shtml|website = www.socialworktoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] are two of the biggest social networks in the world.

=== Facebook ===
{{essay|section|date=December 2015}}
[[Facebook]] is currently the largest social network in the world with more than 1 billion people using this website. This actually means that one in seven people on Earth use Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From relationships to revolutions: seven ways Facebook has changed the world|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-01|first = Jessica|last = Elgot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook users share their stories, images and videos in order to celebrate and commemorate events together. They can also play [[social network game|social games]] and like other Facebook pages.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Moreover, there is also a section called {{'}}''News Feed''{{'}} where users can see social information from their [[Friendship|friends]] or from the pages that they liked or shared. Each user has their own profile page that is called 'wall', where they can post all the above-mentioned materials (their friends can do this as well).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=etd_mas_theses|title = The Virtual Campfire: An Ethnography of Online Social Networking|date = May 2008|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/|publisher = Wesleyan University|last = Ryan|first = Jennifer Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of Facebook is that you can make new friends, as well as find old [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintances]] and restart [[Socialization|socialising]] with them. One of the most useful feature of Facebook is the existence of [[Social group|groups]]. Users with the same interests can create a new group or take part in already existing ones to debate information and exchange their ideas. However, there are also groups that are created to declare an affiliation, such as an obsession for different subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Group Dilemma|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/the-group-dilemma/2249512130|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] is another social network that allows users to send and read short messages called 'tweets'. Even though messages can contain only 140 characters, this is the perfect length for sending status updates to followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New user FAQs|url = https://support.twitter.com/articles/13920|website = Twitter Help Center|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of Twitter is that people can gain followers quickly and share ideas and [[links (web browser)|links]] very fast. There are [[Social network|network]]s of influential people who can be connected via Twitter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Twitter: Top 5 Ways to Find Your Tribe|url = http://www.thebookdesigner.com/2012/01/twitter-top-5-ways-to-find-your-tribe/|website = The Book Designer|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Twitter, tribes manifest themselves as followers of either a person, a company or an institution. As a result, it can be used as a [[marketing]] tool to make someone's [[product (business)|product]] visible, on condition that a big tribe of followers is created. In order to do this, the right community must be built, as finding the right people can be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Build Your Twitter Tribe|url = http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-build-your-twitter-tribe/|website = Social Media Examiner|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some steps that users could take into account in order to make connections and therefore make people follow them: search using Twitter search, follow the followers of other users, look at Twitter Lists, use #[[Hashtag]]s and find [[Third-party developer|third-party]] programs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Cognition ==
[[Cognition]] is the mental action or process of acquiring [[knowledge]] and understanding through [[thought]], [[experience]] and [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cognition - definition of cognition in English from the Oxford dictionary|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cognition|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; People like to share their ideas and gather together via [[blog]]s. A blog is an online [[Diary|journal]] where people express themselves and want to get their voice heard. People tend to frequent blog communities due to the fact that they offer specific information in which the reader is interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|url = http://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|website = Blog Basics|publisher = https://www.google.com/+Blogbasics|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[business]] blogs that can be used to share information within a company. These can be used as a flexible medium, where employees can be informed about topics that can range from the use of new [[technology]] to the company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Help - IBM Connections|url = https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/help/index.jsp?topic=%252Fcom.ibm.lotus.connections.blogs.help%252Fc_welcome_blogs.html|website = www.ibm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On blogs, people tend to gather in tribes or [[clan]]s if they find information that can satisfy their interests. In order to accomplish this goal, bloggers title their postings in such way that they can catch people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medical Web Design {{!}} Medical Marketing {{!}} Medical Web Development|url = http://www.mednet-tech.com/newsletter/blogs/what-are-blogs|website = www.mednet-tech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest advantage of blogs is that bloggers tend to help each other when someone feels at a loss due to the fact that some bonds might have been created inside the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blog Tip Friday: Create your blogging tribe|url = http://www.honestmom.com/2013/04/05/blog-tip-friday-create-your-blogging-tribe/|website = Honest Mom|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Find a Tribe-Kirsten Oliphant|last = says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
As [[Seth Godin]] states, "''The Internet eliminated geography''".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People join tribes or clans because they find and share the same ideas and interests with other people.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The main disadvantage of old tribes is that they couldn't influence group behaviour. On the other hand, new tribes are self-sustaining and can survive without a leader, they are not necessarily dialogue based and they are long lasting. As it has been demonstrated within this article, tribes have influenced the way languages, organisations and cultures work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They have redefined old concepts with the help of social media and have changed the way people will interact in the future.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Turkology''' (or '''Turcology''') is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and [[ethnology]] of people speaking [[Turkic languages]] and [[Turkic peoples]] in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the [[Sakha people|Sakha]] in East [[Siberia]] to the [[Balkan]] Turks and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] in [[Moldova]].

==History==
Ethnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] in the ''Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk'' (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German  ''Codex Cumanicus'', ''Armenian-Kipchak'', and ''Russian-Kipchak'' dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around [[Byzantium|Byzantine]]/[[Greece|Greek]] historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers.  In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Turkish language]], and the Turkic languages of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski|F. Mesgnien-Meninski]]'s 4-volume ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium'' published in 1680.

P. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his ''Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects'' (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's ''Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language'' (1839), O. N. Betlingk ''Grammar of the Yakut language'' (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age [[Old Turkic script|Orkhon]] inscriptions by [[V. Thomsen]] and [[W. W. Radloff]] (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of ''Türkische Bibliothek'' (1905–27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by ''Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte'' (1921–26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.

===Persecution in Soviet Russia===

On 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting "ancientization" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the [[intelligentsia]], massive creation of replacement "scientists", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in [[Middle Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the [[Bolshevik]]'s assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|wiped out]].

On the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word "Türk" by a wealth of euphemisms: "nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was "writing into a drawer", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for "correct" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. [[Lev Gumilev|L.N.Gumilev]] and [[Olzhas Suleimenov|O.Suleimenov]] inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.

With the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Vortextuality''' is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the [[blogosphere]].

In his book, ''Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Whannel, G|year=2002|title=Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh4THME06t0C&amp;pg=PT213|isbn=0-415-17038-9|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explained this term, noting:"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a "vortex" effect".

The vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid.  Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else.  They are drawn in, as if by a vortex."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whannel gives the example of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]], journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the [[election of Barack Obama]] and the [[death of Michael Jackson]].&lt;!-- NOT PUBLISHED YET &lt;ref name=cp65&gt;Whannel, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">The term '''white savior''', sometimes combined with [[savior complex]] to write '''white savior complex''', refers to a [[white people|white person]] who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts perceived to be self-serving. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]" (1899) by [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="zane"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zane | first=Damian | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36132482 | title=Barbie challenges the 'white saviour complex' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=May 1, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer [[Teju Cole]] combined the term and "industrial complex" (derived from [[military-industrial complex]] and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin "White Savior Industrial Complex".

==Association with Africa==
{{see also|Aid}}
Africa has a [[slavery in Africa|history of slavery]] and [[Colonisation of Africa|of colonization]]. Damian Zane of [[BBC News]] said due to the history, Africans find the "white savior" attitude to help them "deeply patronising and offensive". Zane said, "Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help."&lt;ref name="zane" /&gt; Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said, "Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent."&lt;ref name="shringarpure"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shringarpure | first=Bhakti | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/digital-saviour-saving-lives-internet-age-save-darfur | title=The rise of the digital saviour: can Facebook likes change the world? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 18, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Karen Attiah]] said the white savior framework in Africa "follows the venerable tradition" of the novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) by [[Joseph Conrad]] and that the tradition included the film ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'' (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' (2012), and the writings of journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]].&lt;ref name="attiah"&gt;{{cite news | last=Attiah | first=Karen | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/06/louise-linton-just-wrote-the-perfect-white-savior-in-africa-story/ | title=Louise Linton just wrote the perfect White-Savior-in-Africa story | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor and producer [[Louise Linton]] wrote a memoir about her [[gap year]] in [[Zambia]], ''In Congo's Shadow'', and wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', "How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare", to promote the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Linton | first=Louise | authorlink=Louise Linton | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | title=How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701064204/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | archivedate=July 1, 2016 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=July 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Schaub of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "The reaction to Linton's article was swift and negative, accusing her of using clichés and misrepresentations... Several people have described Linton's memoir as a 'white savior' fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Schaub | first=Michael | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-louise-linton-memoir-20160706-snap-htmlstory.html |title=Controversial Africa memoir draws fire for Louise Linton, actress, self-published author and Trump dining companion | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zambians and other Africans negatively criticized the article on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shearlaw | first=Maeve | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/zambians-hit-back-at-white-saviour-gap-yah-memoir | title=Briton's African gap year memoir sparks angry Twitter response | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=July 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attiah said the popular [[Instagram]] account "BarbieSavior" was inspired by the backlash to Linton's words.&lt;ref name="attiah" /&gt; [[Special Broadcasting Service]]'s Amal Awad said the Instagram account was parodied "a reckless trend" of [[voluntourism]] (volunteering and touring) in which "'white saviours' use the less fortunate like props in their social media profiles". Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Awad | first=Amal | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/04/28/when-saviour-becomes-story | title=When the saviour becomes the story | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] | date=April 28, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', were critical of the "white savior complex" in the 2014 documentary ''[[Virunga (film)|Virunga]]'', which features the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park]] and the conservation work of its [[park ranger]]s. They said, "The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baaz | first1=Maria Eriksson | last2=Gondola | first2=Didier | last3=Marijnen | first3=Esther | last4=Verweijen | first4=Judith | url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-03-05/virungas-white-savior-complex | title=Virunga's White Savior Complex | work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in film==
{{main|White savior narrative in film}}
In film, the white savior is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing.&lt;ref name="temple1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2263_reg.html | title=Matthew W. Hughey: The White Savior Film | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trope reflects how media represents [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people.&lt;ref name="temple2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/authors/2263_qa.html | title=Interview with Matthew W. Hughey | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. ''Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness'' labels the stories as fantasies that "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic". Types of stories include white travels to "exotic" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the [[Southern United States|American South]], or white protagonists having "racially diverse" helpers.&lt;ref name="vera"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Vera | first1=Hernán | last2=Gordon | first2=Andrew M. | year=2003 | chapter=The Beautiful White American: Sincere Fictions of the Savior | title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | isbn=978-1-4616-4286-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in television==

Stephanie Greco Larson, writing in ''Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment'', said ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978–1986) and ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' (1983–1987) were "shows in which white families adopt black children" and represented versions of "the white man's burden theme on television".&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Stephanie Greco | year=2006 | chapter=African Americans in Film and Television Entertainment | title=Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment | series=Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics | publisher=Rowmn &amp; Littlefield | isbn=978-0-8476-9453-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin R. Means Coleman said, "In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Robin R. Means | year=2003 | chapter=Black Sitcom Portrayals | editor1-last=Dines | editor1-first=Gail | editor2-last=Humez | editor2-first=Jean M. | title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader | edition=2nd | publisher=SAGE | isbn=978-0-7619-2261-2 | page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian [[Donald Bogle]] said, "The millionaire Drummond becomes a ''great white father figure'', able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match." Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a "white savior" type who uses "his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode "Burial Ground". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping "ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their ''Last of the Dogmen''-like secret existence intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tahmahkera | first=Dustin | year=2014 | chapter=Settler Self-Determination | title=Tribal Television: Viewing Native People in Sitcoms | publisher=UNC Press Books | isbn=978-1-4696-1869-2 | pages=96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson said, "Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: ''[[Room 222]]'' (1969–1974), ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' (1975–1979), ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'' (1978–1981), and ''[[Boston Public]]'' (2000–2004). Larson said while ''Room 222'' and ''Boston Public'' also had black teachers that "challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers."&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

The TV series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2017–) features [[Finn Jones]] as the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of ''The Nerds of Color'' pop culture blog, "If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Victor | first=Daniel | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/television/iron-fist-actor-at-center-of-whitewashing-debate-asks-fans-to-wait-and-see.html | title='Iron Fist' Actor, at Center of Whitewashing Debate, Asks Fans to Wait and See | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 8, 2017 | accessdate=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="White Savior Industrial Complex"==
[[File:Teju Cole.jpg|right|thumbnail|Writer Teju Cole, who coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex"]]
Writer [[Teju Cole]] coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex" following the release of the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on [[Twitter]]. He later wrote an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cole | first=Teju | authorlink=Teju Cole | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-white-savior-industrial-complex/254843/ | title=The White-Savior Industrial Complex | journal=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 21, 2012 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote frame|
# From Sachs to Kristof to Invisible Children to TED, the fastest growth industry in the US is the White Savior Industrial Complex.
# The white savior supports brutal policies in the morning, founds charities in the afternoon, and receives awards in the evening.
# The banality of evil transmutes into the banality of sentimentality. The world is nothing but a problem to be solved by enthusiasm.
# This world exists simply to satisfy the needs--including, importantly, the sentimental needs--of white people and Oprah.
# The White Savior Industrial Complex is not about justice. It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.
# Feverish worry over that awful African warlord. But close to 1.5 million Iraqis died from an American war of choice. Worry about that.
# I deeply respect American sentimentality, the way one respects a wounded hippo. You must keep an eye on it, for you know it is deadly.

Cole's response became a [[viral phenomenon]], and ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the ''Kony 2012'' political campaign, "With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital."&lt;ref name="shringarpure" /&gt; Heather Laine Talley, writing in ''Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance'', said of the response to Cole coining the term, "The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist." Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, "Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Talley | first=Heather Laine | year=2014 | title=Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-8411-2 | pages=128–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Engles, writing in ''Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education'', concurred with Cole's assessment, "The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Engles | first=Tim | year=2016 | chapter=Racialized Slacktivism | editor1-last=Kennedy | editor1-first=Tammie M. | editor2-last=Middleton | editor2-first=Irene Joyce | editor3-last=Ratcliffe | editor3-first=Krista | title=Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education | publisher=SIU Press | isbn=978-0-8093-3546-6 | page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In news and political media==
{{expand-section|date=January 2018}}
The removal of [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the "white savior complex". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/assed-baig/malala-yousafzai-white-saviour_b_3592165.html|title=Malala Yousafzai and the White Saviour Complex|date=15 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bennorton.com/malala-yousafzai-spivak-abu-lughod-and-the-white-savior-complex/|title=Malala Yousafzai, Spivak, Abu-Lughod, &amp; the White Savior Complex|date=12 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Zimbabwe]], and began his career as a theatre director in Scotland in the late 1970s, before establishing the [[Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh|Assembly Rooms]] as a [[fringe theatre]] venue in 1981, leasing it from [[Edinburgh Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19810717&amp;id=XO5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kacMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2563,3217771&amp;hl=en|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The venue has been referred to as the "National Theatre of the Fringe".&lt;ref name=WOS/&gt;

Burdett-Coutts came to operate the venue after he was too late to find anywhere else to stage the play he intended to bring to the Fringe, [[The Madman and the Nun]]. He was working at the [[Old Vic]] at the time. The Assembly Rooms on [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] had previously been home to the Festival Club, but they had vacated the building after finding it unprofitable to operate. This left it available for Burdett-Coutts, and gave him space to host other shows.&lt;ref name=Venables170606/&gt;

Burdett-Coutts fought for the Assembly Rooms to remain a venue only building, against Edinburgh Council's plan to turn the ground floor space into shops and a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/william-burdett-coutts-don-t-bring-curtain-down-on-assembly-as-we-know-it-1-1313744|title=William Burdett-Coutts: Don't bring curtain down on Assembly as we know it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Wonders of the world map.jpg|270px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Map of the Wonders of the World {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:traveler/Wonders_of_the_World|interactive map]])}}]] 
Various lists of the '''Wonders of the World''' have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures.

The [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of [[classical antiquity]]; it was based on guidebooks popular among [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] sightseers and only includes works located around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] rim and in [[Mesopotamia]]. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anon. |year=1993|title=The Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia|edition=First |publisher=Oxford: Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many similar lists have been made.

The historian [[Herodotus]] (484 – ca. 425 BC) and the scholar [[Callimachus]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (ca. 305–240 BC), at the [[Musaeum|Museum of Alexandria]], made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings have not survived, except as references.

The classic seven wonders were:

* [[Colossus of Rhodes]]
* [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]
* [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]
* [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]
* [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]
* [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]
* [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus

The only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza.

==Lists from other eras==

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind, and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages. However, it is unlikely that these lists originated in the [[Middle Ages]], because the word "[[middle Ages|medieval]]" was not invented until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century. ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' refers to them as "later list[s]",&lt;ref name="brewers" /&gt; suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known.&lt;ref name="carrington"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hereward Carrington (1880–1958) |title=The Seven Wonders of the World: ancient, medieval and modern", reprinted in the ''Carington Collection'' (2003) |isbn= 0-7661-4378-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btDWYgEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+carrington+collection&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h2QIU7X9H-S9ygOs64HwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Carrington Collection|publisher=|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent lists==

Following in the tradition of the classical list, modern people and organisations have made their own lists of wonderful things ancient and modern. Some of the most notable lists are presented below.

===American Society of Civil Engineers===
In 1994, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] compiled a list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World, paying tribute to the "greatest civil engineering achievements of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/Content.aspx?id=2147487305 |title=American Society of Civil Engineers Seven Wonders |website=ASCE.org |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802060056/http://www.asce.org/Content.aspx?id=2147487305 |archivedate=August  2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402072318/http://www.asce.org/history/seven_wonders.cfm |title=Seven Wonders of the Modern World|website=ASCE.org|author=American Society of Civil Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven Natural Wonders of the World===

Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over how large the list should be. One of the many existing lists was compiled by [[CNN]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/9711/natural.wonders/ |title=Natural Wonders |work=CNN |date=November 11, 1997 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721011803/http://www.cnn.com/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/9711/natural.wonders/ |archivedate=July 21, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven Wonders of the Underwater World===

The Seven Underwater Wonders of the World was a list drawn up by CEDAM International, an American-based non-profit group for divers, dedicated to ocean preservation and research.

In 1989 CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists, including Dr. Eugenie Clark, to pick underwater areas which they considered to be worthy of protection. The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington DC by actor [[Lloyd Bridges]], star of TV's ''[[Sea Hunt]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wonderclub.com/WorldWonders/UnderWaterWonders.html/ |title=Underwater Wonders of the World |publisher=Wonderclub |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613234745/http://wonderclub.com/WorldWonders/UnderWaterWonders.html# |archive-date=June 13, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
