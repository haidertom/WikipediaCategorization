It is used to determine the qualification for the [[BWF World Championships|World Championships]] and [[Badminton at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]],&lt;ref name="ranking law"&gt;{{cite web|title=5.3.3.1 World Ranking System |url=http://system.bwf.website/documents/folder_1_81/folder_1_82/New-Regulations-2018/5.3.3.1%20World%20Ranking%20System.pdf |website=Bwfbadminton.org |publisher=Badminton World Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[BWF World Tour]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BWF World Tour |url=http://bwfcorporate.com/events/bwf-world-tour/ |publisher=BWF Corporate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seedings of draws at all BWF-sanctioned tournaments are conducted using the BWF World Ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Competition Regulations|url=http://bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=524457&amp;dl=1|website=Bwfbadminton.org|publisher=Badminton World Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Players under 19 years of age are eligible to rank in the [[BWF World Junior Ranking]], which were introduced in January 2011. The following lists are the rankings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Junior ranking|url=http://bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=16443|website=Bwfbadminton.org|publisher=Badminton World Federation|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130125839/http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=16443|archive-date=2010-11-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ranking points are awarded based on the level and progress of the tournament from each player/pair. Ranking points calculated are based on the tournaments each players/pairs participate in from the last 52 weeks. If a player or pair has participated in ten or fewer World Ranking tournaments, then the ranking is worked out by adding together the points won at tournaments in the last 52 weeks. If a player or pair has participated in 11 or more World Ranking tournaments, only the 10 highest points scored in the tournaments during the 52-week period count towards their ranking. The highest possible ranking points are 116,000.&lt;ref name="ranking law" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Ranking System"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Ranking|url=http://bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=15370|website=Bwfbadminton.org|publisher=Badminton World Federation|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814200157/http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=15370|archive-date=2010-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.badmintonmonthly.com/best-badminton-players/| title= Best Badminton Players }} Thursday, September 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===''DCP1''===

The first edition of ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', commonly referred to as ''DCP1'', was published in 1993.&lt;ref name=pubdates/&gt; ''DCP1'' is cited in the 1993 [[World Development Report]].

''DCP1'' is organized into five parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries |editor1-last=Jamison |editor1-first=Dean T. |editor2-last=Mosley |editor2-first=W. Henry |editor3-last=Measham |editor3-first=Anthony R. |editor4-last=Bobadilla |editor4-first=José Luis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Introduction
* The Unfinished Agenda, I · Infectious Disease
* The Unfinished Agenda, II · Reproductive Health and Malnutrition
* Emerging Problems
* Conclusion

Each part has chapters within it; there are 29 chapters in all. The report spans more than 700 pages and has as contributors 79 authors in addition to the four editors.

===''DCP2''===

The second edition of ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', commonly referred to as ''DCP2'' and sometimes referred to as "the DCP2 Report", was published in 2006.&lt;ref name=pubdates/&gt; ''DCP2'' is organized into 73 chapters, and is a 1400-page report by more than 350 specialists around the world with the goal of providing policy recommendations to reduce global disease burdens.&lt;ref name=dcp2report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123153101/http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (2nd Edition)|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is in English, but translations for some of the chapters to [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are available. The report has been released under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons attribution license (CC-BY)]] and a copy of ''DCP2'' can be downloaded from the [[World Bank]]'s Open Knowledge Repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/7242|title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, Second Edition|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project (mirrored on the World Bank website)|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of the report can also be read online on the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11728/|title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project (mirrored on the NCBI website)|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to ''DCP1'', ''DCP2'' is more systematic in its coverage.&lt;ref name=dcp2_fm/&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

===''DCP3''===

For third edition, the name of the report was shortened to ''Disease Control Priorities''. The third edition is commonly referred to as ''DCP3'', and is under preparation and is expected to be published over the time period 2015–2016. It has nine separate volumes. The final and summary volume will be published in 2016. Separate volumes on [[cancer]] and [[surgery]] will be published earlier. [[Toby Ord]] of [[Giving What We Can]] is on the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-05-13/toby-ord-and-dcp3|title = Toby Ord and DCP3|last = Hutchinson|first = Michelle|date = May 13, 2014|accessdate = May 14, 2014|publisher = [[Giving What We Can]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2016, four of nine volumes of ''DCP3'' have been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcp-3.org/news/press-releasedisease-control-priorities-3rd-edition-releases-fourth-volume-mental-neurological |date=April 11, 2016 |title=PRESS RELEASE: Disease Control Priorities, 3rd Edition Releases Fourth Volume: Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders |publisher=DCPP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31700">The '''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems''' (EOLSS) is an [[encyclopedia]] on the science of [[sustainable development]] and conservation of [[life support system]]s on [[earth]]. The extensive publication is published under the patronage of [[UNESCO]].

==Overview==
In 1996, international [[scientists]], [[engineers]], and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mexico City]], [[Beijing]] and the [[Bahamas]] to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the [[biosphere]] in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]; [[Mathematical sciences]]; [[Biological]], [[physiological]] and [[health sciences]]; [[Biotechnology]]; [[Land use]], [[land cover]] and [[soil sciences]]; [[Tropical]] biology and conservation management; [[Social sciences]] and [[humanities]]; [[Physical sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Control systems]], [[robotics]] and [[automation]]; [[Chemical sciences]] engineering and technology resources; [[Water Science|Water sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Energy|Energy sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Environmental and [[ecological |ecological sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; [[Human resources]] policy, development and management; [[Natural resources]] policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); [[Desalination]] and water resources.

The way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as [[crowdsourcing]], where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of [[peer review]] and the joint [[Paris]]-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in [[Oxford]] as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as [[book]]s, [[e-books]] or scholarly [[subscription]]s.

The web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the [[United States]] and [[India]]. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the [[European Union]] who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eolss.net EOLSS, official website], retrieved on 2004-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Av0Yq6cVk EOLSS], Introduction on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]].

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed divides]] of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&amp;nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "continent" implies [[physical geography]], the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The border does not follow political boundaries, with [[Turkey]], [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] being [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]].

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]] of which the [[Russian Federation]] is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

Europe, in particular [[ancient Greece]], was the birthplace of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&amp;pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ...

[[Renaissance humanism]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]], [[Renaissance art|art]] and [[Renaissance science|science]] led to the [[modern era]]. Since the [[Age of Discovery]] started by [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers [[European colonialism|controlled]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]] and the majority of Asia.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded, following a speech by Sir [[Winston Churchill]], with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Vatican City]]. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states. The [[European Anthem]] is "[[Ode to Joy (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]", and states celebrate peace and unity on [[Europe Day]].

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') is the name of either a [[Phoenicia]]n princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), "wide, broad"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') "eye, face, countenance",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect". ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and the poetry devoted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second part compare also the divine attributes of [[Athena#Cult and attributes|"grey-eyed" Athena]] (γλαυκῶπις, ''glaukōpis'') or [[Hera|ox-eyed Hera]] (βοῶπις, ''boōpis'').

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for "west", this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening, west",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' "[sun] rise", "east", hence [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Barry: "L’Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant". In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=451 |isbn=978-0-19-815221-7 |oclc= |doi=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to these hypotheses there is also a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;regʷos'', meaning "darkness", which also produced Greek ''[[Erebus]]''.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' ("land of the [[Franks]]") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name="davison"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether countries are considered in Europe or Asia can vary in sources, for example in the classification of the [[CIA World Factbook]] or that of the [[BBC]]. Note also that certain countries in Europe, such as France, have [[List of countries spanning more than one continent#Non-contiguous|territories lying geographically outside Europe]], but which are nevertheless considered integral parts of that country.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'''Key:''' &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt;: [[transcontinental country|states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia]];

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]]. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. [[Cyprus]] is closest to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. [[Malta]] was considered an island of [[Northwest Africa]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

===History of the concept===

====Early history====
[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|A medieval [[T and O map]] from 1472 showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]] — Asia to Sem ([[Shem]]), Europe to Iafeth ([[Japheth]]), and Africa to Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]])]]
The first recorded usage of ''Eurṓpē'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]]. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern [[Rioni River]]) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The geographical system of Herodotus examined and explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244 p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the [[Nile]] and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]], rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 4:45&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer [[Strabo]] at the River Don.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geography 11.1''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]]'' described the continents as the lands given by [[Noah]] to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], separating it from [[Northwest Africa]], to the Don, separating it from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and the Jewish antiquities of Flavius Josephus|first= Thomas W.|last= Franxman|publisher=Pontificium Institutum Biblicum|year= 1979|isbn=978-88-7653-335-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention received by the [[Middle Ages]] and surviving into modern usage is that of the [[Roman era]] used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;I. G. Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738 p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;
who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.

The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]].

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern [[Iberia]], the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', 1993, ""Culture and Society in the First Europe", pp185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: ''Europa'' often{{dubious|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--inflated from "once or twice"--&gt; figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Cantor, 1993:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern definitions====

The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [[Muscovy]] began to include Northern Asia.

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was adopted by the Russian Empire, and introduced the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Europe: A History |page=8 |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|author1=Davies|first1=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108153922/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=8 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.
Cited as de facto convention by Baron von Haxthausen, ''Transcaucasia'' (1854); review [https://books.google.com/books?id=SN0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 Dublin University Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Moores, R.W. Fairbridge, ''Encyclopedia of European and Asian regional geology'', Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-412-74040-4}}, p. 34: "most Soviet geographers took the watershed of the Main Range of the Greater Caucasus as the boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the standard convention in the later 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Borza"&gt;{{Citation | last = Borza | first = E.N. | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]).

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name="mieawl"/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1.

Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]], also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name="natgeo 135"&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [[Asia Minor]].

This territory, under the Arabic name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance.

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name="natgeo 143"&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 162"&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "[[Holy Roman Emperor]]" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 166"&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and causing a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.{{sfn|Bulliet|Crossley|Headrick|Hirsch|2011|page=250}}{{sfn|Brown|Anatolios|Palmer|2009|page=66}} Further East, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Medieval demography}}
The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting in Messina - British Library Royal MS 16 G vi f350r (detail).jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|[[Tancred of Sicily]] and [[Philip II of France]], during the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192)]]

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 186"&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 192"&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 199"&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|Morisson|2007|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] and was weakened considerably by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="DuikerSpielvogel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [[Florence]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a [[Renaissance humanism|new humanism]] was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and Arabic knowledge from [[Monasticism|monastic]] libraries, often translated from Arabic into [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Weiss|Weiss, Roberto]] (1969) ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', {{ISBN|1-59740-150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jacob Burckhardt]]|origyear=1878|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2074 |title=The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=translation by S.G.C Middlemore|year=1990|isbn=978-0-14-044534-3|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [[Renaissance art|art]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], and the [[History of science in the Renaissance|sciences]], under the joint patronage of [[Royal family|royalty]], the nobility, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and an emerging merchant class.&lt;ref name="natgeo 254"&gt;National Geographic, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', {{ISBN|0-395-88947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons in Italy, including the [[Medici]] family of Florentine bankers and the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], funded prolific [[quattrocento]] and [[cinquecento]] artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 292"&gt;National Geographic, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=High Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.&lt;ref name="natgeo 193"&gt;National Geographic, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=John Morris Roberts|title=Penguin History of Europe|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 296"&gt;National Geographic, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish expedition led by [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the [[New World]] in 1492, the Portuguese sailor [[Vasco da Gama]] opened the ocean route to the [[Orient|East]] in 1498 and the Spanish explorer [[Sebastian Elcano]] made the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing huge global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref name="natgeo 338"&gt;National Geographic, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia.

The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the works]] of German theologian [[Martin Luther]], an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.&lt;ref name="natgeo 256"&gt;National Geographic, 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics History of Europe – Demographics].

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804) and [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the [[Balkans]], which ended with the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912-1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=3044&amp;HistoryID=ac79], ''Ottoman Empire – 19th century'', Historyworld&lt;/ref&gt; Formal recognition of the ''de facto'' independent principalities of [[Montenegro]], [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Romania]] ensued at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.

Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918.

Russia was plunged into the [[Russian Revolution]], which threw down the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist monarchy]] and replaced it with the [[communist]] [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 480"&gt;National Geographic, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The [[Treaty of Versailles]], which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions.&lt;ref name="natgeo 443"&gt;''National Geographic'', 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the [[Russian Civil War]] (including the postwar [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]]) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mark Harrison| title = Accounting for War: Soviet Production, Employment, and the Defence Burden, 1940–1945| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yJcD7_Q_rQ8C&amp;pg=PA167| date = 18 July 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89424-1| page = 167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932–1933, under [[Stalin]]'s leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933|second Soviet famine]] which caused millions of deaths;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179818.stm Legacy of famine divides Ukraine]".

The [[social revolution]]s sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following [[The Great War]]: in 1919, with the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany, and the [[First Austrian Republic]]; in 1922, with [[Mussolini]]'s one party [[Fascism|fascist]] government in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and in [[Ataturk]]'s [[Turkish Republic]], adopting the Western alphabet, and state [[secularism]].
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [[Fascism|fascist movements]] developed throughout Europe placing [[Adolf Hitler]] in power of what became [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|publisher=Vintage|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-73005-7|title=The Age of Extremes: A history of the world, 1914–1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 438"&gt;''National Geographic'', 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

With tensions mounting between Germany and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] over the future of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 465"&gt;National Geographic, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A. J. P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=978-0-684-82947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik]] and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany [[Battle of France|attacked France]] through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.&lt;ref name="natgeo 510"&gt;''National Geographic'', 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 532"&gt;''National Geographic'', 532.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.&lt;ref name="natgeo 511"&gt;''National Geographic'', 511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 519"&gt;''National Geographic'', 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which involved the largest [[Battle of Prokhorovka|tank battle]] in history, was the last major German offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally [[Battle of Berlin|fell in 1945]], ending World War II in Europe.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[Iron Curtain]]". The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 530"&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Schuman Declaration]] led to the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. It began the [[European integration|integration process]] of the [[European Union]] ([[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950, at the [[French Foreign Ministry]]).]]

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"/&gt; In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name="natgeo 536"&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name="natgeo 537"&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name="natgeo 535"&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom, in a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|non-binding referendum]] on EU membership voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cuper |first = Simon |date = 23 May 2014 |title = Why Europe works |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/51dd9432-db03-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0.html |publisher = [[Financial Times|ft.com]] |accessdate = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]]. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |website=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight%2Fclimates%2Feuropean_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is {{convert|16|°C}}, while it is only {{convert|12|°C}} in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{convert|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost {{convert|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt; Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a temperate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is {{convert|9.05|C|F}}. However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of {{convert|-6.5|C|F}}, giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe|Geological history of Europe}}
[[File:Mount Elbrus May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Russia]] is the highest mountain in Europe.]]

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo–Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Flora===

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S., Thomas, C. and Bale, J. (1997), Nettle-feeding nymphalid butterflies: temperature, development and distribution. Ecological Entomology, 22: 390–398. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00082.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:39:06|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

{{Supranational European Bodies|size=300px|align=right}}

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [[parliamentary democracy]], in most cases in the form of [[Republic]]; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [[Monarchies in Europe|Monarchy]]. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies&lt;ref&gt;not counting the microstate of [[Vatican City]]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]].

[[European integration]] is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [[Council of Europe]] since the end of [[World War II]]
The [[European Union]] has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [[Schengen Area]] and 19 of the monetary union [[Eurozone]]. Among the smaller European organizations are the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes Åland (a [[region of Finland]]), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three [[Crown dependencies]], and two [[British Overseas Territories]]. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three [[countries of the United Kingdom]] with devolved powers and the two [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as [[Heligoland]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are also not included for this reason.

{{Main|Economy of Europe|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)}}

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128110049/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174617/http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 19 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is [[Moldova]] with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2|title=The World Bank DataBank |website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Some data refers to IMF staff estimates but some are actual figures for the year 2017, made in 12 April 2017.

===Economic history===
;Industrial growth (1760–1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172857/http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism |date=17 May 2014 }}. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

;Cold War (1945–1991)
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19540-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name="loc-cs"&gt;"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State Office of the historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

;Reunification (1991–present)
[[File:Carte zone euro.svg|thumb| [[Eurozone]] (blue colour)]]
With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepropheticyears.com/reasons/The%20rise%20of%20the...oman%20empire.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}{{Better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

In 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to {{UN_Population|source}}, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. This number includes Asian Russia (Siberia, about 36 million people) but excludes the European part of Turkey, Cyprus and the Transcaucasian countries.
A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name="World Population Growth, 1950–2050"&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Most of Europe is in a mode of [[Sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.
The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the [[microstate]] of [[Monaco]].

===Ethnic groups===
{{main|Ethnic groups in Europe}}

Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Pan, Beate Sibylle Pfeil, ''Minderheitenrechte in Europa.

According to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653&amp;nbsp;million people (medium variant, 556 to 777&amp;nbsp;million in low and high variants, respectively).&lt;ref name="UNPP 2006" /&gt; Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to [[Human overpopulation|fertility rates]].

Today, [[European diaspora|large populations of European descent]] are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]) and some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}

Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edl.ecml.at/LanguageFun/LanguageFacts/tabid/1859/Default.aspx Language facts – European day of languages], Council of Europe. Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; mostly falling within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and parts of Russia. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]). [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]) are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]], and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], most notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]].

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
{{further|European folklore|European art}}
"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|its culture]].
The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [[Christendom]] (or more specifically [[Latin Christendom]]), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [[Islamic conquests|against Islam]], as in the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilarie Belloc]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]], [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin (Romance)]] and [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]], but with several components not part of either of these group (notably [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Celtic Europe|Celtic]]).
Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andreas M.

The largest religion in Europe is [[Christianity]], with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves [[Christian]]s,&lt;ref name="Christianity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-regions/#europe|title=Regional Distribution of Christians: Christianity in Europe|date=18 December 2011|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and various [[Protestant]] denominations. Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Reformed faith]]. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like [[Anabaptists]] were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the [[United States]] such as [[Pentecostalism]], [[Adventism]], [[Methodism]], [[Baptists]] and various [[Evangelical Protestants]]; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most popular religion is [[Islam]] (6%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-muslim/ |title=The Global Religious Landscape: Muslims |accessdate=18 December 2012 |website=pewforum|date=2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[TRNC|North Cyprus]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Idel-Ural|Volga-Ural region]]). Other religions, including Judaism, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's [[Republic of Kalmykia]]). The 20th century saw the revival of [[Neopaganism]] through movements such as [[Wicca]] and [[Druidry]].

Europe has become a relatively [[secular]] continent, with an increasing number and proportion of [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[atheism|atheist]] and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] people, who make up about 18.2% of Europe's population,&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently the largest secular population in the [[Western religion|Western world]].

Global HealthShare® initiative (GHS) is a program launched in June 2010 by the [[University of California, Davis]] Center of Excellence for [[Nutritional genomics|Nutritional Genomics]]. The program plans to share resources to improve the health in [[developing countries]]. Alliances with other research institutions, humanitarian organizations and private companies around the world have been made to meet this goal.

The organization will use a multidisciplinary approach against [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[Infectious disease|infectious]] disease, breaking down their efforts into two main research "cores": the Nutrition Core and Mucosal Immunity Core. The former focuses on fighting [[malnutrition]] and the latter on developing new ways to deliver [[vaccines]] more effectively to developing countries. The program differentiates itself from others like it by focusing on the delivery of the beneficial product to the end-user rather than the academic research process.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

V. | editor4-last = Spier | editor4-first = F.  | publisher = Uchitel Publishing | pages = 274–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

'''Globalization of sports''' refers to the process of expansion of the idea of [[sport]] across the world and phenomena is how that are associated with it.The field of sports in the 20th-21st century was naturally influenced by the process of globalisation.[[Globalization]] not only impacts the way in which sports are conducted and organised but also how they are perceived and what they mean in today's world.

== Origins ==
The roots of modern sports can be found in the mid-nineteenth century in Great Britain and the United States where first professional sports were organised in mining and industrial towns and cities. Back then, sport competition was conducted mostly on local and national level. First signs of globalization in that matter appeared because of the global hegemonic position that Great Britain had in the nineteenth century. Due to the British influence, popularity of such sports as [[football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] or [[cricket]] grew rapidly throughout the world, very often replacing traditional local games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1930 world cup teams.png|thumb|right|Teams of the FIFA World Cup 1930]]

Another step in the globalization of sports was taken with the establishment of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1894 and the revival of the [[1896_Summer_Olympics|Olympics Games in 1896]]. The first modern Olympics Games were organised in its ancient birthplace of Athens and attracted athletes from fourteen nations. Despite that most of the participants were European, the Olympics Games of 1896 initiated regularly held international sport competition that soon spread on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOC|url=https://www.olympic.org/athens-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 in Paris, the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football (FIFA)]] was founded by representatives of France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Shortly after, other European associations joined and by 1909 FIFA was consisted only from nations of the “old continent”. This state of affairs did not last long and South Africa was the first country from overseas that joined the Federation followed by Argentina and Chile (1912) and the United States (1913). This allowed FIFA to start its global activities and in 1930 the first FIFA World Cup was organised. The tournament which was hosted in Uruguay was announced as a great success despite that only four European teams were able to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile other international sport federations started appearing and after the World War II, when the United States rose as a global power, “American” sports like [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] began getting more popularity around the world. [[FIVB|International Volleyball Federation (FIVB)]] organised their first World Championship in 1949 while [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation (FIBA)]] hosted theirs in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, globalization of sports was fueled by the expansion of technology and the introduction of commercial aspects to sports. On one hand newspaper, radio and especially television exposed sports to the wider international audience (first FIFA World Cup was televised in 1956 and first Summer Olympics in 1960), on the other commercial advertising allowed to profit from them.

Since the end of the world it was said that twentieth century the globalization of sports rapidly accelerated by bringing television and corporate sponsorship. It led to the commercialization of sport and gave birth to the sport industry. Therefore, in the context of globalization, sport in the contemporary world can be characterised by the following tendencies:
[[File:London NBA 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Jersey Nets]] during [[NBA Global Games]] in London in 2008]]

* Increased involvement of global telecommunication companies allows international sport organizations and federations such as the International Olympic Committee or International Federation of Association Football to generate enormous revenues by selling television rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=George|title=Sport and Globalization|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1999/OREXXVI29/OREXXVI29q.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased involvement of transnational companies (even those not connected to the sports industry) leads to a new trend of “naming” in which sponsor’s name or label is associated with stadium, sports arena, team or sports contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreff|first1=Wladimir|title=Globalization of the Sports Economy|journal=Rivista di Diritto ed Economia dello Sport|volume=4|issue=3|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involvement of those companies leads to the professionalization of sports that allows formerly amateur athletes to earn money. In the same time, at the highest level, we can observe enormous growth of income among athletes.

* Promotion of national leagues or team in markets overseas is more and more popular. During pre-season top-tier teams travel to different parts of the world no longer solely to prepare themselves for the upcoming season but rather to promote their team, league, merchandise and sponsors - European football teams organize matches and tournaments in the North America and Asia, while American basketball teams travel to Europe and Asia.

* Future expansion of regional tournaments, leagues and competitions to new geographic areas becomes a new possibility. Even though some games of the regular season of the [[NBA|National Basketball Association (NBA)]] were already organized outside of the United States and Canada, there are further plans of establishing a team based in London or even adding several European teams to the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA eyes European expansion|url=http://m.rte.ie/amp/228197/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the president of the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)]] suggested that [[UEFA Champions League]] final could be played outside of Europe - for example in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uefa president open to Champions League final being held outside Europe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/uefa-president-champions-league-final-outside-europe|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased diversity in athletes’ origins participating in national professional leagues around the world as well as the number of countries participating in sports events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Globalization of sports has also a negative impact that can be visible in the following issues:
[[File:Poland vs Albania (3187519345).jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian player [[Roger Guerreiro]] (in red in the foreground) playing for [[Polish national football team|Polish national football team]]]]

* Because of globalization and commercialization, the value of a certain sport is very often determined by the size of available audience for media, advertisers and sponsors. It undermines basic principles of sport and may eventually lead to a decrease in the diversity in sport and sporting heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Even though migration and movement of athletes can be seen as something positive there are some controversies around it. First of all, rich countries are able to drain talent from poorer countries negatively influencing their sport system. That happened in the case of the massive exodus of Kenyan athletes who were lured by opportunities offered by Qatar and Bahrain. Secondly, globalization led to a trend of recruiting athletes from other countries in order to compete in international sport events. In that case citizenship and affiliation are easily exchanged for the right sport skills and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Lucie|title=Globalization of Sport: An Inconvenient Truth|journal=Journal of Sport Management|date=2009|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Globalization of sports creates also possibilities for different kinds of criminal activity. Match fixing and referee corruption are a rising threat because of the growth of international betting and gambling on sports events. Alleged corruption of officials of the most important international sport organizations and associations (like FIFA) may lead to controversies associated with organization of sport events. In the same time, those big sport institutions may be used as tools for money laundering. Another issue that shows the dark side of globalization of sports is the use of [[Doping in sport|banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreff|first1=Wladimir|title=Globalization of the Sports Economy|journal=Rivista di Diritto ed Economia dello Sport|volume=4|issue=3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Depression''' was a severe worldwide [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning [[Great Depression in the United States|in the United States]]. The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Garraty, ''The Great Depression'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''The New York Times'', March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world's economy can decline.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Eichengreen, ''Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, and the Uses-and Misuses-of History'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the [[stock market crash]] of October 29, 1929 (known as [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide [[Gross domestic product|gross domestic product (GDP)]] fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lowenstein, "History Repeating," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-hall-of-mirrors-by-barry-eichengreen-1421192283 ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, ''Great Depression'' (1986) ch1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both [[developed country|rich]] and [[developing country|poor]]. [[Personal income]], tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.&lt;ref name="Frank_Bernanke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Robert H.|last2=Bernanke|first2=Ben S.|title= Principles of Macroeconomics|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2007|edition=3rd|page=98|isbn= 0-07-319397-6|volume=|url=|accessdate=|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities around the world were hit]] hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%.&lt;ref name="USBLS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/|title= Commodity Data|publisher=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cochrane, Willard W.|authorlink=Willard Cochrane |title=Farm Prices, Myth and Reality|year=1958|page=15|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[League of Nations]]|title=World Economic Survey 1932–33| page=43|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector industries]] such as mining and logging suffered the most.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Depression Decade''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1929 wall street crash graph.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.8|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Industrial]], 1928–30]]

Economic historians usually attribute the start of the Great Depression to the sudden devastating collapse of U.S. stock market prices on October 29, 1929, known as [[Black Tuesday]]. However,&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/243118/Great-Depression Great Depression], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; some dispute this conclusion and see the stock crash as a symptom, rather than a cause, of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="Frank_Bernanke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The Great Depression|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 optimism persisted for some time. [[John D. Rockefeller]] said "These are days when many are discouraged. In the 93 years of my life, depressions have come and gone. Prosperity has always returned and will again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture18.html |title=Crashing Hopes: The Great Depression |accessdate=2008-03-13 |last=Schultz |first=Stanley K. |year=1999 |work=American History 102: Civil War to the Present |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323120342/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture18.html |archivedate=2008-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April. This was still almost 30% below the peak of September 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_98/vronsky060698.html |title=1998/99 Prognosis Based Upon 1929 Market Autopsy |publisher=Gold Eagle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075810/http://www.gold-eagle.com/editorials_98/vronsky060698.html |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, government and business spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by 10%. In addition, beginning in the mid-1930s, a [[Dust Bowl|severe drought]] ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U.S.&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1930, interest rates had dropped to low levels, but expected [[deflation]] and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment were depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Hamilton|title=Monetary Factors in the Great Depression|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–169|year=1987|doi= 10.1016/0304-3932(87)90045-6|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1930, automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a [[deflationary spiral]] started in 1931. Farmers faced a worse outlook; declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook. At its peak, the Great Depression saw nearly 10% of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/DustBowl/TheGreatDepression.aspx|title=The Great Depression|website=drought.unl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first; then, internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies, such as the 1930 U.S. [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] and retaliatory tariffs in other countries, exacerbated the collapse in global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard|first1=Clay Hanes (editor)|title=Historic Events for Students: The Great Depression|date=July 2002|publisher=Gale|isbn=978-0787657017|edition=Volume I}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, the economic decline had pushed world trade to one-third of its level just four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/854609153|title=Worlds together, worlds apart : a history of the world from the beginnings of humankind to the present|last=L.|first=Tignor, Robert|isbn=9780393922073|edition=Fourth|location=New York|oclc=854609153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two classical competing theories of the Great Depression are the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] (demand-driven) and the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] explanation. There are also various [[Heterodox economics|heterodox theories]] that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large-scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.

Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;Robert Whaples, ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'', ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 150 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR], or [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of [[Milton Friedman]] and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

There is consensus that the [[Federal Reserve System]] should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse. If they had done this, the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'', ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 143 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR], or [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream explanations===

====Keynesian====
British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' that lower [[aggregate expenditure]]s in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average. In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment.

Keynes' basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] to pick up the slack by increasing [[government spending]] and/or cutting taxes.

As the Depression wore on, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tried [[public works]], [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]], and other devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. According to the Keynesians, this improved the economy, but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| authorlink=Lawrence Klein|first=Lawrence R.|last=Klein|title=The Keynesian Revolution|year=1947| pages=56–58, 169, 177–79|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}; {{Cite book|first=Theodore|last=Rosenof|title=Economics in the Long Run: New Deal Theorists and Their Legacies, 1933–1993|year=1997|location=Chapel Hill|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-2315-5|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monetarist====

[[File:American union bank.gif|thumb|Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a [[bank run]] early in the Great Depression]]

Monetarists follow the explanation given by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J. Schwartz]]. They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly [[Contractionary monetary policy|monetary contraction]] of 35%, which they called "The [[Great Contraction]]." This caused a price drop of 33% ([[deflation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-g4AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA11#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Pin%20the%20blame%20squarely%20on%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%22 ''Reflections on the Great Depression''], Edward Elgar Publishing, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling, the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Bernanke|year=2000|title=Essays on the Great Depression|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c2OSWhLjzJkC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;vq=Schwartz&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22poor%20policy-making%22|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=7|isbn=0-691-01698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was endorsed by [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Fed Governor]] [[Ben Bernanke]] in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement:

{{cquote|Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.&lt;ref&gt;Ben S. Bernanke (8 Nov 2002), [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm FederalReserve.gov: Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Bernanke}}

The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the [[New York Bank of United States]] – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought [[government bond]]s on the [[open market]] to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 |title=Who Was Milton Friedman? |website=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date= 15 Feb 2007|author=Paul Krugman|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410200144/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With significantly less money to go around, businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Edward Griffin|title=The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve|url=https://ia601603.us.archive.org/28/items/TheCreatureFromJekyllIslandByG.EdwardGriffin/The-Creature-from-Jekyll-Island-by-G.-Edward-Griffin_text.pdf|year=1998|edition=3d|page=503|isbn= 978-0-912986-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the [[gold standard]]. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the [[Federal Reserve Act]], which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;Frank Freidel (1973), [https://archive.org/details/franklindrooseve04fran ''Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal''], ch. 19, Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; A "promise of gold" is not as good as "gold in the hand", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 6102]] making the private ownership of [[gold certificate]]s, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.&lt;ref name="text"/&gt;

====Common position====
From the point of view of today's mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates [[money supply]] and/or [[aggregate demand]] on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression [[central bank]]s should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.

The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy.

====Modern non-monetary explanations====
The monetary explanation has two weaknesses. First it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"/&gt; Second it is not able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.

=====Debt deflation=====

[[File:U.S. Public and Private Debt as a % of GDP.jpg|thumb]]
[[Irving Fisher]] argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing over-indebtedness.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Irving|date= October 1933|title=The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions|journal=Econometrica|volume=1| pages=337–357|doi=10.2307/1907327|issue=4|publisher=The Econometric Society|ref=harv|jstor=1907327}}&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off
# A fall in the level of asset prices
# A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses, precipitating bankruptcies
# A fall in profits
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment
# [[Pessimism]] and loss of confidence
# Hoarding of money
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt;

During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.&lt;ref name="Margin Requirements"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortune|first=Peter|date=Sep–Oct 2000|title= Margin Requirements, Margin Loans, and Margin Rates: Practice and Principles – analysis of history of margin credit regulations – Statistical Data Included|journal=New England Economic Review|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3937/is_2000_Sept-Oct/ai_80855422/pg_5|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120527091755/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3937/is_2000_Sept-Oct/ai_80855422/pg_5|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2012-05-27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers [[Margin call|called in these loans]], which could not be paid back.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/money_08.html|title=Bank Failures|publisher=Living History Farm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090219185825/http://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/money_08.html|archive-date=2009-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits ''en masse'', triggering multiple [[bank run]]s. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"/&gt;

Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the [[Emergency Banking Act|March Bank Holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;"Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States", 352&lt;/ref&gt; Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, [[Investment|capital investment]] and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"/&gt; Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious cycle]] developed and the downward spiral accelerated.

The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt; This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.

Fisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.

Building on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, [[Ben Bernanke]] developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered [[aggregate demand]], a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernanke83"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernanke|first=Ben S|date=June 1983|title=Non-Monetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression|journal=The American Economic Review|publisher=The American Economic Association|volume=73|issue=3|pages=257–276|ref=harv|jstor=1808111|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/dpaterson/econ532/10twenties/bernanke.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishkin78"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0022050700087167|last=Mishkin|first= Fredric|date=December 1978|title=The Household Balance and the Great Depression|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=38|issue=4|pages=918–37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Expectations hypothesis=====
Since economic mainstream turned to the [[new neoclassical synthesis]], expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models. According to [[Peter Temin]], Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and [[Christina Romer]], the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turn around. Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With these positive expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30% lower in 1937 than in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1476 ''Great Expectations and the End of the Depression''], American Economic Review 2008, 98:4, 1476–1516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Romer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/business/how-the-fiscal-stimulus-helped-and-could-have-done-more.html "The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable"], ''The New York Times'', October 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, ''Lessons from the Great Depression'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|9780262261197}}, pp. 87–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recession of 1937–38]], which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 would be first steps to a restoration of the pre-March 1933 policy regime.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29730131 Great Expectations and the End of the Depression], The American Economic Review, Vol. 98, No. 4 (Sep., 2008), S. 1476–1516, p. 1480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterodox theories===

====Austrian School====
Two prominent theorists in the [[Austrian School]] on the Great Depression include Austrian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] and American economist [[Murray Rothbard]], who wrote ''[[America's Great Depression]]'' (1963). In their view, much like the monetarists, the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] (of which was created in 1913) shoulders much of the blame; however unlike the [[Monetarism|Monetarists]], they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the [[money supply]] in the 1920s, of which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.&lt;ref name="America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163"&gt;Murray Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2000), pp. 159–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and [[capital goods]]. Therefore, by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction.&lt;ref name="America's Great Depression, pp. 159-163" /&gt; In February 1929 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions would lead to a crisis starting in the [[Stock market|stock]] and [[Credit market|credit]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur, ''The Cave and the Light: Plato versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization'', p. 548 (Kindle location 10208).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rothbard, the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'', pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]], after 1970 [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;For Hayek's view, see Diego Pizano, ''Conversations with Great Economists: Friedrich A. Hayek, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, Leonid V. Kantorovich, Joan Robinson, Paul A.Samuelson, Jan Tinbergen'' (Jorge Pinto Books, 2009). For Rothbard's view, see Murray Rothbard, ''A History of Money and Banking in the United States'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute), pp. 293–294.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Depression (in 1932&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in 1934)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hayek had criticized both the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] and the [[Bank of England]] for not taking a more contractionary stance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[John Cunningham Wood]], Robert D. Wood, ''Friedrich A. Hayek'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, {{ISBN|9780415310574}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Sennholz]], another prominent [[Austrian Economist|Austrian economist]], argued that most [[Austrian business cycle theory|boom and busts]] that plagued the American economy, such as those in [[Panic of 1819|1819–20]], [[Depression of 1837|1839–43]], [[Panic of 1857|1857–60]], [[Long Depression|1873–78]], [[Depression of 1893|1893–97]], and [[Depression of 1920–21|1920–21]], were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit, which was soon followed by the inevitable bust. The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge Administration]]. The passing of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], the passage of [[The Federal Reserve Act]], rising government deficits, the passage of the [[Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act]], and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], exacerbated and prolonged the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-great-depression/|title=The Great Depression|accessdate=October 23, 2016|work=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|first=Hans|last=Sennholz|date=October 1, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote in the 1930s: "Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not a real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/causes-economic-crisis-and-other-essays-and-after-great-depression|title=The Causes of the Economic Crisis, and Other Essays Before and After the Great Depression|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|first=Ludwig|last=Mises}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/buying-bad-debt-to-return-bank-solvency-2011-2?op=1|title=Buying Bad Debt to Return Bank Solvency|accessdate=October 24, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Bill|last=Bonner|date=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inequality====
[[File:Tenantless farm Texas panhandle 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Mechanised agriculture|Power farming]] displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area. [[Childress County, Texas]], 1938]]

Two economists of the 1920s, [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]], popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers, including Herbert Hoover, [[Henry A. Wallace]], [[Paul Douglas]], and [[Marriner Eccles]]. It held the economy produced more than it consumed, because the consumers did not have enough income. Thus the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics. Interpretations of the Great Depression|journal=Discussion paper no. 2002–14|url= http://www.vwa.unisg.ch/RePEc/usg/dp2002/dp0214allgoewer_ganz.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, the [[root cause]] of the Great Depression was a global over-investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses, such as farms. The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers' pockets. That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintaining the industrial base, and re-inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into [[consumer spending]]. The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed. Foster and Catchings recommended&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Plenty'' (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; federal and state governments to start large construction projects, a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt.

====Productivity shock====
{{quote|It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity, output and employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929.

The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with [[electrification]], [[mass production]] and motorized farm machinery, and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Worsening of global depression==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
The gold standard was the primary transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates. Under the gold standard's [[price–specie flow mechanism]], countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline ([[deflation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, Gianni Toniolo, ''The World Economy between the Wars'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9780198042013}}, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Elgar publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-84376-335-2}}, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also consensus that protectionist policies such as the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] helped to worsen the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples: ''Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions.'' In: ''Journal of Economic History.'' Band 55, Nr. 1 (März 1995), S. 139–154, hier S. 151 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold standard===

Some economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the [[Gold Standard]], it was suspending gold convertibility (or devaluing the currency in gold terms) that did the most to make recovery possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919–1939|authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first=Barry|last=Eichengreen|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1992|isbn= 0-19-506431-3|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression. The UK was the first to do so. Facing [[speculative attack]]s on the [[Pound sterling|pound]] and depleting [[Official gold reserves|gold reserves]], in September 1931 the [[Bank of England]] ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets.

The UK, Japan, and the Scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the U.S., remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called "gold bloc", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935–36.

According to later analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, The UK and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a [[silver standard]], almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries, including [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between national economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernanke|first=Ben|date=March 2, 2004|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

===Breakdown of international trade===
Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade. In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] at least worsened the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions", ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (Mar., 1995), pp. 139–54 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians and economists partly blame the American Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act (enacted June 17, 1930) for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depress.htm |title=The World in Depression |publisher=[[Mount Holyoke College]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310145946/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depress.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average ''[[ad valorem]]'' rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921–25 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931–35. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber.

Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: "imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls". These restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations, causing a major deduction during the depression. Not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries condensed "trade and exchange restrictions only marginally":&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"&gt;EICHENGREEN, B., &amp; IRWIN, D. A. (2010). The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression: Who Succumbed and Why?. Journal of Economic History, 70(4), 871–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Countries that remained on the gold standard, keeping currencies fixed, were more likely to restrict foreign trade." These countries "resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the [[balance of payments]] and limit gold losses." They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*Countries that abandoned the gold standard, allowed their currencies to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciate]] which caused their balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*"The length and depth of a country’s economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the [[gold standard]]. Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries. In contrast, countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps."&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;

====Effect of tariffs====

The consensus view among economists and economic historians is that the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=144|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

In the popular view, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was a leading cause of the depression.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/protectionism-and-the-great-depression/ Protectionism and the Great Depression],'' [[Paul Krugman]], ''[[New York Times]],'' November 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eichenirwin"&gt;''[http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3280 The protectionist temptation: Lessons from the Great Depression for today],'' VOX, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas Irwin, 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, many economists hold the opinion that the tariff act did not greatly worsen the depression.

===German banking crisis of 1931 and British crisis===
{{Split section|European banking crisis of 1931|date=September 2017}}
The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the [[Creditanstalt|Credit Anstalt]] in Vienna in May.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 379–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William Ashworth 1962 pp 237-244"&gt;William Ashworth, ''A short history of the international economy since 1850'' (2nd ed 1962) pp 237–244.&lt;/ref&gt; This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil. With the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.&lt;ref name="Isabel Schnabel 1931"&gt;Isabel Schnabel, "The German twin crisis of 1931." ''Journal of Economic History'' 64#3 (2004): 822–871.&lt;/ref&gt; Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a [[Hoover Moratorium|moratorium on Payment of war reparations]]. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium, was agreed to in July 1931. International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process; it's nothing. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary. The crisis continued to get worse in Germany, bringing political upheaval that finally led to the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|coming to power of Hitler's Nazi regime]] in January 1933.&lt;ref name="V. Hodson, 1938 pp. 64-76"&gt;H. V. Hodson, ''Slump and Recovery, 1929–1937'' (London, 1938), pp. 64–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day.&lt;ref name="David Williams 1963"&gt;David Williams, "London and the 1931 financial crisis." ''Economic History Review'' 15.3 (1963): 513–528.&lt;/ref&gt; Credits of £25 millions each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National government]]." The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the [[gold standard]], and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 386–412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Oxborrow 1976 pp 67-73"&gt;Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, ''Interwar Britain : a social and economic history'' (1976) pp 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turning point and recovery==
[[File:GDP depression.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The overall course of the Depression in the United States, as reflected in per-capita GDP (average income per person) shown in constant year 2000 dollars, plus some of the key events of the period.

In most countries of the world, recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933.&lt;ref name= Britannica/&gt; In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; but the U.S. did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933.

There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of [[reflation]] and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B.

According to [[Christina Romer]], the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to [[Executive Order 6102|devaluation of the U.S. dollar]] and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina D.|date=December 1992|title=What Ended the Great Depression|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf|dead-url=yes|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=52|issue=4|pages=757–784|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117093624/http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf|archive-date=January 17, 2013|quote=monetary development were crucial to the recovery implies that self-correction played little role in the growth of real output|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book, ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna J.

===Role of women and household economics===
Women's primary role were as housewives; without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. Birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Woytinsky and E.S. ''World population and production: trends and outlook'' (1953) p 148&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.&lt;ref&gt;Denyse Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1999), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Stephenson|title=Women in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rqOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=3–5|isbn=9781317876076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan K.

Bean, "'To help keep the home going': female labour supply in interwar London." ''Economic History Review'' (2015) 68#2 pp 441–470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural and small-town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. McCleary, "'I Was Really Proud of Them': Canned Raspberries and Home Production During the Farm Depression." ''Augusta Historical Bulletin'' (2010), Issue 46, pp 14–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In American cities, African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promoted collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Tari Klassen, "How Depression-Era Quiltmakers Constructed Domestic Space: An Interracial Processual Study," ''Midwestern Folklore: Journal of the Hoosier Folklore Society'' (2008) 34#2  pp 17–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the [[Sunday roast]] into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (1999), pp. 70, 108, 136–38, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a nationwide campaign to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Metzler, "Woman's Place in Japan's Great Depression: Reflections on the Moral Economy of Deflation." ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2004) 30#2 pp 315–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Reagin, "Marktordnung and Autarkic Housekeeping: Housewives and Private Consumption under the Four-Year Plan, 1936–1939," ''German History'' (2001) 19#2 pp 162–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and recovery===
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|A female factory worker in 1942, [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces.]]
The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II. Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery. It did help in reducing unemployment.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;Referring to the effect of World War II spending on the economy, economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] said, "One could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas." {{cite video|people=[[Daniel Yergin]], William Cran (writers / producer)|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/story/ch_menu.html|title= Commanding Heights, see chapter 6 video or transcript|medium=TV documentary|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|location=U.S.|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina D.|authorlink=Christina Romer|title=What Ended the Great Depression?|journal=Journal of Economic History|year=1992|volume=52|issue=4|pages=757–784| doi=10.1017/S002205070001189X|quote=fiscal policy was of little consequence even as late as 1942, suggests an interesting twist on the usual view that World War II caused, or at least accelerated, the recovery from the Great Depression.|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgs|first=Robert|date=1992-03-01|title=Wartime Prosperity?

The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 1937–39. By 1937, unemployment in Britain had fallen to 1.5 million. The [[mobilization]] of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment.&lt;ref name="Great Depression and World War II"&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/wwii/jb_wwii_subj.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered into the war in 1941, it finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U.S. unemployment rate down below 10%.&lt;ref name="Depression &amp; World War II"&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/wwii Depression &amp; WWII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625204217/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/wwii |date=2009-06-25 }}. Americaslibrary.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., massive war spending doubled economic growth rates, either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression. Businessmen ignored the mounting [[national debt]] and heavy new taxes, redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the right. Many of the countries in Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw them overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule, [[Nazi Germany#Nazi seizure of power|most famously in Germany]] in 1933.

[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|Unemployed men march in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.]]

Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the [[Dust Bowl]], Canadian industrial production had fallen to only 58% of the 1929 level by 1932, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which fell to only 83% of the 1929 level. Total [[Measures of national income and output|national income]] fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation apart from the United States. Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/English/economy/1929_39depression.html 1929–1939 – The Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127051620/https://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/1929_39depression.html |date=2009-01-27 }}, Source: Bank of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{Main|Great Depression in Chile}}
The [[League of Nations]] labeled [[Chile]] the country hardest hit by the Great Depression because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, which were in low demand. Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930, when GDP dropped 14%, mining income declined 27%, and export earnings fell 28%. By 1932, GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929, exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures.

Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression, many national leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks. After six years of government [[Austerity|austerity measures]], which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's creditworthiness, Chileans elected to office during the 1938–58 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention.

Prompted in part by the devastating [[1939 Chillán earthquake]], the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] government of [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] created the Production Development Corporation (Corporación de Fomento de la Producción, [[CORFO]]) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of [[import substitution industrialization]]. Consequently, as in other Latin American countries, [[protectionism]] became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy.

===China===
{{Main|Nanjing Decade}}
China was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the [[Silver standard]]. However, the U.S. silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China and the British colony of Hong Kong, which followed suit in this regard in September 1935, would be the last to abandon the silver standard. In addition, the [[Nationalist Government]] also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On November 3, 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (fapi) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government.

===European African colonies===
The sharp fall in commodity prices, and the steep decline in exports, hurt the economies of the European colonies in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Latham and John Heaton, ''The Depression and the Developing World, 1914-1939'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, "Mutation de l'impérialisme colonial français dans les années 30." ''African Economic History'' (1977): 103-152. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3601244 online in French]&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural sector was especially hard hit. For example, [[sisal]] had recently become a major export crop in Kenya and Tanganyika. During the depression it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa. Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Westcott, "The East African sisal industry, 1929–1949: the marketing of a colonial commodity during depression and war." ''Journal of African History'' 25.4 (1984): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants, labourers, colonial auxiliaries, and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Olubomehin, "Road Transportation and the Economy of South-Western Nigeria, 1920-1939."

The depression severely hurt the export-based [[Belgian Congo]] economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products. For example, the price of peanuts fell from 125 to 25 centimes. In some areas, as in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] mining region, employment declined by 70%. In the country as a whole, the wage labour force decreased by 72.000 and many men returned to their villages. In Leopoldville, the population decreased by 33%, because of this labour migration.&lt;ref&gt;R. Anstey, ''King Leopold's Legacy: The Congo under Belgian Rule 1908–1960'' (1966), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political protests were not common. However, there was a growing demand that the paternalistic claims be honored by colonial governments to respond vigorously. The theme was that economic reforms were more urgently needed than political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Ochonu, "Critical convergence: the Great Depression and the meshing of Nigerian and British anti-colonial polemic." ''Canadian Journal of African Studies/La Revue canadienne des études africaines'' 43.2 (2009): 245-281.&lt;/ref&gt; French West Africa launched an extensive program of educational reform centered around "rural schools" designed to modernize agriculture and stem the flow of under-employed farm workers to cites where unemployment was high. Students were trained in traditional arts, crafts, and farming techniques and were then expected to return to their own villages and towns.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gamble, "Les paysans de l'empire: écoles rurales et imaginaire colonial en Afrique occidentale française dans les années 1930. ''Cahiers d'Études Africaines'' (2009) 49#3 pp 775-803.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Main|Great Depression in France}}
The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries, hitting hard around 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laufenburger, "France and the Depression," ''International Affairs'' (1936) 15#2 pp. 202–224 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2601740 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dormois, ''The French Economy in the Twentieth Century'' (2004) p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, "The French Depression in the 1930s," ''Review of Economic Dynamics'' (2002) 5:73–99 doi:10.1006/redy.2001.0143&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the depression had drastic effects on the local economy, and partly explains the [[February 6, 1934 riots]] and even more the formation of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], led by [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO socialist leader]] [[Léon Blum]], which won the elections in 1936. Ultra-nationalist groups also saw increased popularity, although democracy prevailed into [[World War II]].

France's relatively high degree of self-sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in nations like Germany.

===Germany===
{{Main|Weimar Republic}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-11-19-12, Adolf Hitler bei Ortsgruppenfeier der NSDAP Rosenheim.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] speaking in 1935]]
The Great Depression hit Germany hard. The impact of the [[Wall Street Crash]] forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]]. The financial crisis escalated out of control and mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the [[Credit Anstalt]] in Vienna in May.&lt;ref name="William Ashworth 1962 pp 237-244"/&gt; This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.&lt;ref name="Isabel Schnabel 1931"/&gt; Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down and the moratorium, was agreed to in July 1931. An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures became more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary.&lt;ref name="V. Hodson, 1938 pp. 64-76"/&gt;

In 1932, 90% of German reparation payments were cancelled. (In the 1950s, Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts.) Widespread unemployment reached 25% as every sector was hurt. The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany's growing crisis, as they were afraid that a high-spending policy could lead to a return of the [[hyperinflation]] that had affected Germany in 1923. Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] was hit hard by the depression, as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/depression/about.htm About the Great Depression], University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate reached nearly 30% in 1932, bolstering support for the Nazi (NSDAP) and Communist (KPD) parties, causing the collapse of the politically centrist Social Democratic Party. Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932, and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election, it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the [[German election, July 1932|general election in July 1932]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/de/de_economic.html Germany – Economic], Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/runs.htm|title=The History Place – Rise of Hitler: Hitler Runs for President|website=www.historyplace.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler followed an [[autarky]] economic policy, creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America. By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions, plus public works spending, unemployment fell significantly by 1935. Large-scale military spending played a major role in the recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Tooze]], ''The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
{{Main|Economic history of Greece and the Greek world}}
The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The [[Bank of Greece]] tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.

Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939, Greek Industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part "built on sand" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The dictatorial regime of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War.

===Iceland===
Icelandic post-World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression. The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted. The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million in 1932, and was not to rise again to the pre-1930 level until after 1939.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Iceland|last=Karlsson|first=Gunnar|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=308–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government interference in the economy increased: "Imports were regulated, trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state-owned banks, and loan capital was largely distributed by state-regulated funds".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], which cut Iceland's exports of saltfish by half, the Depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II (when prices for fish exports soared).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===India===
{{Main|Great Depression in India}}
How much India was affected has been hotly debated. Historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed long-term industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Colonial Economy in the Great Depression, Madras (1929&amp;ndash;1937)|first=K. A. |last=Manikumar|year=2003|ref=Manikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from two sectors—jute and coal—the economy was little affected. However, there were major negative impacts on the jute industry, as world demand fell and prices plunged.&lt;ref&gt;Samita Sen, "Labour, Organization and Gender: The Jute Industry in India in the 1930s," in Helmut Konrad and Wolfgang Maderthaner, eds. ''Routes Into the Abyss: Coping with Crises in the 1930s'' (2013) pp 152-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise conditions were fairly stable. Local markets in agriculture and small-scale industry showed modest gains.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Simmons, "The Great Depression and Indian Industry: Changing interpretations and changing perceptions."

===Ireland===
{{Main|Economic history of the Republic of Ireland}}
Frank Barry and [[Mary E. Daly]] have argued that:
:Ireland was a largely agrarian economy, trading almost exclusively with the UK, at the time of the Great Depression. Beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports, and Ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers, particularly in the early years of the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Barry and Mary F. Daly, "Concurrent Irish Perspectives on the Great Depression" (2010) [ online ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Barry and Mary E. Daly, "Irish Perceptions of the Great Depression" in Michael Psalidopoulos, ''The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context'' (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012) pp. 395–424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also B. Girvin, ''Between Two Worlds: Politics and Economy in Independent Ireland'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Frank, and Mary E. Daly.

===Italy===
{{Main|Economic history of Italy}}
The Great Depression hit [[Economy of Italy under fascism#The Great Depression|Italy]] very hard.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Zamagni, ''The economic history of Italy 1860–1990'' (Oxford University Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail-out—the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless. This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. The [[Industrial Reconstruction Institute]] (IRI) was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest state-owned industrial sector in Europe (excluding the USSR). IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities—restructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mattesini, and Beniamino Quintieri. "Italy and the Great Depression: An analysis of the Italian economy, 1929–1936." ''Explorations in Economic History'' (1997) 34#3 pp: 265–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mattesini and Beniamino Quintieri. "Does a reduction in the length of the working week reduce unemployment? Some evidence from the Italian economy during the Great Depression." ''Explorations in Economic History'' (2006), 43#3, pp: 413–437.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] was the first to implement what have come to be identified as [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economic]] policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving [[deficit spending]]; and second, by devaluing [[Yen|the currency]]. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.&lt;ref&gt;Myung Soo Cha, "Did Takahashi Korekiyo Rescue Japan from the Great Depression?", ''The Journal of Economic History'' 63, No. 1 (March 2003): 127–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions.

This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the [[February 26 Incident]]. This had a [[chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II.

The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as [[Toyota]], have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 [[light industry]] had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.&lt;ref&gt;(For more on the Japanese economy in the 1930s see "MITI and the Japanese Miracle" by [[Chalmers Johnson]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Great Depression in Latin America}}
Because of high levels of U.S. investment in Latin American economies, they were severely damaged by the Depression. Within the region, [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] were particularly badly affected.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Thorp, ''Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1929 crisis, links between the world economy and [[Latin America]]n economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world. As a result, Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly. World prices for commodities such as wheat, coffee and copper plunged. Exports from all of Latin America to the U.S. fell in value from $1.2 billion in 1929 to $335 million in 1933, rising to $660 million in 1940.

But on the other hand, the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production. Following the example of the New Deal, governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}
From roughly 1931 to 1937, the [[Netherlands]] suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression. This depression was partly caused by the after-effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the U.S., and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands. Government policy, especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard, played a role in prolonging the depression. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch national-socialist party [[Nationaal Socialistische Beweging|NSB]]. The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936, when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard, but real economic stability did not return until after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries: 1780–1940'' (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|History of New Zealand#Great Depression}}
[[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]] was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression, as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy. The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers, who were the mainstay of the local economy. Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted, leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope. Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed, the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15%, but unofficially nearly twice that level (official figures excluded Māori and women). In 1932, riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the country's main cities ([[Auckland]], [[Dunedin]], and [[Wellington]]). Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer "special constables".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/whatson/exhibitions/sliceofheaven/exhibition/SocialWelfare/Pages/Greatdepression.aspx Social Welfare and The State: Great Depression]", [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Main|Economic history of Portugal}}
Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta, the [[Ditadura Nacional]], Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression, although [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] to found the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], an [[authoritarian]] [[corporatist]] dictatorship. With the budget balanced in 1929, the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards [[budget balance]] and [[autarky]], causing social discontent but stability and, eventually, an impressive economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;José Cardozo, "The great depression and Portugal" in Michael Psalidopoulos, ed., ''The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context'' (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012), {{ISBN|9789609979368}}. pp. 361–94 [http://www.ics.ul.pt/rdonweb-docs/ICS_JLCardoso_Great_AI.pdf Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puerto Rico===
In the years immediately preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico's two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico's per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=Manuel|publisher=Markus Wiener|year=2011|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1510|title=Graph of U.S. Unemployment Rate: 1930–1945|last=|first=|date=|website=American Social History Project|access-date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide relief and economic reform, the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as [[Carlos E. Chardón|Carlos Chardon]] and [[Luis Muñoz Marín|Luis Munoz Marin]] created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) 1933 and then in 1935, the [[Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration]] (PRRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Puerto Rico|last=Dietz|first=James|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-691-02248-8|location=Princeton|pages=154, 155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeI9DwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Great Depression in South Africa}}
As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically. The [[Carnegie Commission of Investigation on the Poor White Question in South Africa|Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites]] had concluded in 1931 that nearly one third of [[Afrikaner]]s lived as paupers. The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the "gesuiwerde" (purified) and "smelter" (fusionist) factions within the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the [[South African Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan O'Meara, ''Volkskapitalisme: class, capital, and ideology in the development of Afrikaner nationalism, 1934–1948'' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-studies.com/south-africa/the-great-depression-and-the-1930s.html The Great Depression and the 1930S], Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Minnaar, "Unemployment and relief measures during the Great Depression (1929-1934)." ''Kleio'' 26.1 (1994): 45-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union was the world's sole [[communist state]] with very little international trade. Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was only slightly affected by the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Davies, Mark Harrison, and Stephen G. Wheatcroft, eds. ''The economic transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913–1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Its forced transformation from a rural to an industrial society succeeded in building up heavy industry, at the cost of millions of lives in rural Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Depression, the Soviet economy was growing steadily, fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry. The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably. Jennifer Burns wrote:
{{quote|As the Great Depression ground on and unemployment soared, intellectuals began unfavorably comparing their faltering capitalist economy to Russian Communism. ... More than ten years after the Revolution, Communism was finally reaching full flower, according to ''New York Times'' reporter [[Walter Duranty]], a Stalin fan who vigorously debunked accounts of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933|Ukraine famine]], a man-made disaster that would leave millions dead."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Burns (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z6e9X6JxHpMC&amp;pg=PA34 Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right''], p. 34. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-532487-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite all of this, The Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union, mostly from Finland and Germany. Soviet Russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle, because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause. However, when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941, most of these Germans and Finns were arrested and sent to Siberia, while their Russian-born children were placed in orphanages. Their fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article237e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{Main|Economic history of Spain}}
Spain had a relatively isolated economy, with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression. The banking system held up well, as did agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Tortella and Jordi Palafox, "Banking and Industry in Spain 1918–1936," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1984), 13#2 Special Issue, pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war, 1936–39]]. Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile. By staying neutral in the Second World War, and selling to both sides, the economy avoided further disasters.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Harrison, ''Economic History of Modern Spain'' (1978), pp. 129–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{Main|Economy of Sweden}}
By the 1930s, Sweden had what America's ''Life magazine'' called in 1938 the "world's highest standard of living". Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression. Taking place in the midst of a short-lived government and a less-than-a-decade old Swedish democracy, events such as those surrounding [[Ivar Kreuger]] (who eventually committed suicide) remain infamous in Swedish history. The [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] under [[Per Albin Hansson]] formed their first long-lived government in 1932 based on strong [[Interventionism (economics)|interventionist]] and [[welfare state]] policies, monopolizing the office of [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] until 1976 with the sole and short-lived exception of [[Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp]]'s "summer cabinet" in 1936. During forty years of hegemony, it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Göran Therborn]], "A Unique Chapter in the History of Democracy: The Swedish Social Democrats", in K. Misgeld et al (eds), ''Creating Social Democracy'', University Park Pa., Penn State University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
In Thailand, then known as the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]], the Great Depression contributed to the end of the [[Prajadhipok#Last absolute monarch|absolute monarchy of King Rama VII]] in the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Interwar Britain}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|thumb|right|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]
The World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the [[World War I|First World War]] more than a decade earlier. The country was driven off the [[gold standard]] in 1931.

The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day.&lt;ref name="David Williams 1963"/&gt; Credits of £25 millions each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 millions fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 386–412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Oxborrow 1976 pp 67-73"/&gt;

The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed. By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. In 1933, 30% of [[Glasgow|Glaswegians]] were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70% as shipbuilding fell by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression/ Unemployment During The Great Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124124118/http://thegreatdepression.co.uk/unemployment-during-the-great-depression |date=2009-01-24 }}, thegreatdepression.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Hunger March, 1932|National Hunger March]] of September–October 1932 was the largest&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Chris and Bewes, Diccon; ''What Happened Where: A Guide To Places And Events In Twentieth-Century History'' p. 115; Routledge, 1997 {{ISBN|1-85728-533-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a series of [[hunger marches]] in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s.

In the less industrial [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Southern England]], the effects were short-lived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time. Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding [[middle class]]. Agriculture also saw a boom during this period.&lt;ref name="Social Conditions in Britain 1918-1939"&gt;[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Constantine, Stephen]] (1983), ''Social Conditions in Britain 1918–1939'', {{ISBN|0-416-36010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1930 Congress approved the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items. The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods, while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers. Other nations increased tariffs on American-made goods in retaliation, reducing international trade, and worsening the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1921_timeline/smoot_tariff.html "Smoot-Hawley Tariff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312055958/http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1921_timeline/smoot_tariff.html |date=2009-03-12 }}, ''U.S. Department of State''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the [[Emergency Relief and Construction Act]] (ERA) which included funds for [[public works]] programs such as dams and the creation of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2&amp;nbsp;billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2&amp;nbsp;billion was not enough to save all the banks, and [[bank run]]s and bank failures continued.&lt;ref name="Peter Clemens 1954, p. 114"/&gt; Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the [[Realigning election|political realignment]] in 1932 that brought to power [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal.

Shortly after President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was inaugurated in 1933, drought and erosion combined to cause the [[Dust Bowl]], shifting hundreds of thousands of [[displaced persons]] off their farms in the Midwest. From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate [[demand]] and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms.

During a "bank holiday" that lasted five days, the [[Emergency Banking Act]] was signed into law. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] comprehensively regulated the securities industry. This was followed by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] which created the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Although amended, key provisions of both Acts are still in force. Federal insurance of [[Deposit account|bank deposits]] was provided by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]], and the [[Glass–Steagall Act]].

The [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices. The [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy. It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight [[deflation]]ary "cut-throat competition" by the setting of minimum prices and [[Minimum wage|wages]], labor standards, and competitive conditions in all industries. It encouraged unions that would raise wages, to increase the [[purchasing power]] of the [[working class]]. The NRA [[Schechter v. United States|was deemed unconstitutional]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1935.

These reforms, together with several other relief and recovery measures, are called the [[First New Deal]]. Economic stimulus was attempted through a new [[Alphabet agencies|alphabet soup of agencies]] set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]]. By 1935, the "[[Second New Deal]]" added [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] (which was later considerably extended through the [[Fair Deal]]), a jobs program for the unemployed (the [[Works Progress Administration]], WPA) and, through the [[National Labor Relations Board]], a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%. Roosevelt kept it at 40% until the war began, when it soared to 128%.

By 1936, the main [[economic indicator]]s had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high at 11%, although this was considerably lower than the 25% unemployment rate seen in 1933. In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937. In June 1937, the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldston, ''The Great Depression'', Fawcett Publications, 1968, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
The American economy then took a sharp downturn, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of [[durable good]]s fell even faster. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938, rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''Economic Fluctuations'', Maurice W. Lee, Chairman of Economics Dept., Washington State College, published by R. D. Irwin Inc, Homewood, Illinois, 1955, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Cycles'', James Arthur Estey, Purdue University, Prentice-Hall, 1950, pp. 22–23 chart.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpa1.JPG|thumb|The [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] employed 2–3 million at unskilled labor.]]

Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice W. Lee, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; After the recovery from the Recession of 1937–38, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan [[conservative coalition]] to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs. Social Security remained in place.

Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditure tripled, and Roosevelt's critics charged that he was turning America into a [[Socialism|socialist]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M.

[[Keynesianism]] generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[neoliberal]] economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of [[neoliberalism]] and incorporated them into the [[Chicago School of Economics]] as an alternative approach to the study of economics. Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lanny Ebenstein]], ''Milton Friedman: A Biography'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing, as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma. Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', published in 1939 and written by [[John Steinbeck]], who was awarded both the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature and the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the work. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the [[Agriculture|agricultural industry]] occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;David Taylor, ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerre Mangione, ''The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935–1943'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Hirsch, ''Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers' Project'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stacy I.

A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression, among them the [[Kit Kittredge]] series of ''[[American Girl]]'' books written by [[Valerie Tripp]] and illustrated by [[Walter Rane]], released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company.

==Naming==
{{Further|Depression (economics)}}
The term "The Great Depression" is most frequently attributed to British economist [[Lionel Robbins]], whose 1934 book ''The Great Depression'' is credited with formalizing the phrase,&lt;ref name="hnn"&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/61931.html When Did the Great Depression Receive Its Name? (And Who Named It?)], 2-16-09, by Noah Mendel, [[History News Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term,&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Manchester, ''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932–1972''.&lt;/ref&gt; informally referring to the downturn as a depression, with such uses as "Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement" (December 1930, Message to Congress), and "I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression" (1931).

[[File:Schwarzer Freitag Wien 1873.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Black Friday, 9 May 1873, Vienna Stock Exchange. The [[Panic of 1873]] and [[Long Depression]] followed.]]
The term "[[Depression (economics)|depression]]" to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century, when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists. Indeed, the first major American economic crisis, the [[Panic of 1819]], was described by then-president [[James Monroe]] as "a depression",&lt;ref name="hnn"/&gt; and the most recent economic crisis, the [[Depression of 1920–21]], had been referred to as a "depression" by then-president [[Calvin Coolidge]].

Financial crises were traditionally referred to as "panics", most recently the major [[Panic of 1907]], and the minor [[Panic of 1910–11]], though the 1929 crisis was called "The Crash", and the term "panic" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression, the term "The Great Depression" was already used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has retroactively been renamed the [[Long Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T.

===Other "great depressions"===
Other economic downturns have been called a "great depression", but none had been as widespread, or lasted for so long. Various nations have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns, which were referred to as "depressions", but none have had such a widespread global impact.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[causes of the Great Recession]] seem similar to the Great Depression, but significant differences exist. The previous chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], [[Ben Bernanke]], had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the [[late-2000s recession]].

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;If we contrast the 1930s with the Crash of 2008 where gold went through the roof, it is clear that the U.S. dollar on the gold standard was a completely different animal in comparison to the fiat free-floating U.S. dollar currency we have today. Both currencies in 1929 and 2008 were the U.S. dollar, but in an analogous way it is as if one was a Saber-toothed tiger and the other is a Bengal tiger; they are two completely different animals. Where we have experienced inflation since the Crash of 2008, the situation was much different in the 1930s when deflation set in. Unlike the deflation of the early 1930s, the U.S. economy currently appears to be in a "liquidity trap," or a situation where monetary policy is unable to stimulate an economy back to health.

In terms of the stock market, nearly three years after the 1929 crash, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]] dropped 8.4% on August 12, 1932. Where we have experienced great volatility with large intraday swings in the past two months, in 2011, we have not experienced any record-shattering daily percentage drops to the tune of the 1930s. Where many of us may have that '30s feeling, in light of the DJIA, the CPI, and the national unemployment rate, we are simply not living in the '30s. Some individuals may feel as if we are living in a depression, but for many others the current [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] simply does not feel like a depression akin to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Marco (October 6, 2011).

1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes;&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose (September 14, 2010). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html "IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London). "America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned."&lt;/ref&gt; half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months, something that was not repeated until the late-2000s recession. 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929.

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

The '''history of Eurasia''' is the collective history of a continental area with several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Europe]], linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]] of [[Central Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. Perhaps beginning with the [[Steppe Route]] trade, the early [[Silk Road]], the Eurasian view of history seeks establishing genetic, cultural, and linguistic links between European and Asian cultures of antiquity. In fact, much interest in this area lies with the presumed origin of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language]] and [[Chariot warfare]] in [[Central Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, for instance, gives an overall view of Central Eurasian history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==
{{main|Prehistoric Europe|Prehistoric Asia}}

===Lower Paleolithic===

Fossilized remains of [[Homo ergaster]] and [[Homo erectus]] between 1.8 and 1.0 million years old have been found in Europe (Georgia ([[Dmanisi]]), Spain), Indonesia (e.g., [[Sangiran]] and [[Trinil]]), Vietnam, and China (e.g., Shaanxi). (See also:[[Multiregional hypothesis]].) The first remains are of [[Olduwan]] culture, later of [[Acheulean]] and [[Clactonian]] culture. Finds of later fossils, such as [[Homo cepranensis]], are local in nature, so the extent of human residence in Eurasia during 1,000,000 - 300,000 ybp remains a mystery.

=== Middle Paleolithic ===
[[Geologic temperature record]]s indicate two intense ice ages dated around [[Cromerian Stage|650000 ybp]] and [[Anglian Stage|450000 ybp]]. These would have presented any humans outside the [[tropics]] unprecedented difficulties. Indeed, fossils from this period are very few, and little can be said of human habitats in Eurasia during this period. The few finds are of [[Homo antecessor]] and [[Homo heidelbergensis]], and [Lantian Man]] in China. 

After this,[[Homo neanderthalensis]], with his [[Mousterian]] technology, emerged, in areas from Europe to western Asia and continued to be the dominant group of humans in Europe and the Middle East up until 40000-28000 ybp. [[Peking man]] has also been dated to this period. During the [[Eemian Stage]], humans probably (e.g. [[Wolf Cave]]) spread wherever their technology and skills allowed. TBhe [[Saharan pump theory|Sahara dried]] up, forming a difficult area for peoples to cross.

The birth of the first modern humans ([[Homo sapiens idaltu]]) has been dated between 200000 to 130000 ybp (see:[[Mitochondrial Eve]], [[Single-origin hypothesis]]), that is, to the coldest phase of the [[Riss glaciation]]. Remains of [[Aterian]] culture appear in the archaeological evidence.

==== Population bottleneck ====
In the beginning of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]] a [[Toba catastrophe theory|supervolcano]] erupted in Indonesia. Theory states the effects of the eruption caused global climatic changes for many years, effectively obliterating most of the earlier cultures. [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] (90000 - 60000 BP, [[Y-chromosomal_Adam#Time_frame|dated data]]) was initially dated here. [[Neanderthal]]s survived this abrupt change in the environment, so it's possible for other human groups too. According to the theory humans survived in Africa, and began to resettle areas north, as the effects of the eruption slowly vanished. [[Great Leap Forward (evolution)|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] began after this extreme event, the earliest finds are dated c.50000 BCE.

A divergence in genetical evidence occurs during the early phase of the glaciation. Descendants of female [[haplogroup]]s [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]], [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]] and male [[Haplogroup CT (Y-DNA)|CT]] are the  ones found among Eurasian peoples today.

=== Upper Paleolithic ===
[[Image:Upper Paleolihic Art in Europe.gif|thumb|300px|right|Humans populated all of ice-free Europe during the Upper Paleolithic]]
{{see|Early human migrations|Neanderthal admixture|Emireh culture|Ordosian culture|Châtelperronian|Aurignacian|Gravettian|Solutrean|Magdalenian}}
{{See also|Pre-history of the Southern Levant}}
The [[Southern Dispersal]] scenario postulates the arrival of [[anatomically modern humans]] to Eurasia beginning about 70,000 BC. Moving along the southern coast of Asia, they reached [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] by about 65,000 years ago. 
The establishment of population centers in Western Asia, the Indian subcontinent and in East Asia is attested by about 50,000 years ago.
The Eurasian Upper Paleolithic proper is taken after c. 45,000 years ago, with the [[Cro-Magnon]] expansion of [[European early modern humans|into Europe]] ([[Mousterian]]), and the expansion into the [[Mammoth steppe]] of Northern Asia.


==== Migrations ====
[[Image:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A model of human migration on the globe, based on mitochondrial genetics.]]
Tracing back minute differences in the [[genome]]s of modern humans by methods of [[genetic genealogy]], can and have been used to produce models of [[historical migration]]. Though these give indications of the routes taken by ancestral humans, the dating of the various genetic markers is improving. The earliest migrations (dated c. 75.000 BP) from the [[Red Sea]] shores have been most likely along southern coast of Asia. After this, tracking and timing genetical markers gets increasingly difficult. What is known, is that on areas, of what is now Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, genetic markers diversify (from about 60000 BCE), and subsequent migrations emerge to all directions (even back to the [[Levant]]) and North Africs. From the foothills of the [[Zagros]], [[big game hunting]] cultures developed which spread across the [[Eurasian]] [[steppe]].  Crossing the [[Caucasus]] and the Ural Mountains were the ancestors of Samoyeds and the ancestors of Uralic peoples, developing sleds, skis and canoes.  Through [[Kazakhstan]] moved the ancestors of the Indigenous Americans (dated 50000 - 40000 BCE). Eastbound (maybe through [[Dzungaria]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] went the ancestors of the northern Chinese and Koreans. It is possible that the routes taken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ancestors travelled across the Bosphorus. Genetic evidence suggests a number of separate migrations (1.Anatoleans 2.Tocharians, 3 Celto-Illyrians, 4.Germanic and Slav, - possibly in this order). Archaeological evidence has not been identified for a number of different groups. On historical linguistic evidence, see for example [[classification of Thracian]]. The traditional view of associating early Celts with the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] with Germanic peoples.   The Roman Empire spread after the first widespread use of iron outside Central Europe from the [[Villanovan culture]] area. Most likely there was trade also in these periods, e.g. with [[Amber#Amber art and ornament|amber]] and [[salt]] being major products. 

Influences from northern Africa via [[Cardium Pottery|Gibraltar]] and [[Sicani|Sicilia]] cannot be readily discounted. Many other questions remain open, too; for example, Neanderthals were still present at this time. More genetic data is being gathered by various research programs.

===Early Holocene===
{{main|Neolithic Revolution}}
{{See also|Mesolithic}}

[[File:European-middle-neolithic-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Primary cultural areas in Europe c.4500 BC]]

As the ice age ended, major environmental changes happened, such as [[sea level rise]] (est. 120m), vegetation changes, and animals disappearing in the [[Holocene extinction event]]. At the same time [[Neolithic revolution]] began and humans started to make [[pottery]], began to cultivate crops and [[Domestication|domesticated]] some animal species.  

Neolithic cultures in Eurasia are many, and best discussed in separate articles. Some of the articles on this subject include: [[Natufian culture]], [[Jōmon]] culture, [[List of Neolithic cultures of China]] and [[Mehrgarh]]. European sites are many, they are discussed in [[Prehistoric Europe]]. The finding of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] (dated 3300 BC) provides an important insight to [[Chalcolithic]] period in Europe. [[Proto-language]]s of various peoples have been forming in this period, though no literal evidence can (by definition) be found. Later migrations further complicate the study of migrations in this period.

==Writing, the civilizations emerge==
{{main|Ancient history|Civilisation}}
Origins of [[History of writing|writing]] are dated to fourth millennium BC. Writing may have started independently on various areas of Eurasia. It appears the skill spread relatively fast, giving people a new way of [[communication]].

The three regions of Western, Eastern and Southern Asia developed in a similar manner with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys.  The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], and [[History of China|China]] (along the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]) shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[History of mathematics|mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] also shared this model.   These civilizations were most likely in more or less regular contact with each other by the early versions of the [[silk road]]. 

Europe was different, however.  It was somewhat further north and contained no river systems to support agriculture.  Thus Europe remained comparatively undeveloped, with only the southern tips of the region ([[Greece]] and [[Italy]]) being able to fully borrow crops, technologies, and ideas from the Middle East and North Africa. Similarly, civilization didn't arise in [[Southeast Asia]] until contact was made with [[History of India|ancient India]], which gave rise to [[Indianized kingdom]]s in [[Indochina]] and the [[Malay archipelago]]. The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent.  The northern part of the silk road traversed this region. 

One such central expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] which spread their languages into the Middle East, India, Europe, and to the borders of China (with the [[Tocharians]]). Throughout their history, up to the development of [[gunpowder]], all the areas of Eurasia would be repeatedly menaced by the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] nomads from the steppe.

A difference between Europe and most of the regions of Eurasia is that each of the latter regions has few obstructions internally even though it is ringed by mountains and deserts. This meant that it was easier to establish unified control over the entire region, and this did occur with massive empires consistently dominating the Middle East, China, and at times, much of India. Europe, however, is riddled with internal mountain ranges: The [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and many others. Throughout its history, Europe has thus usually been divided into many small states, much like the [[Middle East]] and [[Indian subcontinent]] for much of their history.

The [[Iron Age]] made large stands of timber essential to a nation's success because smelting iron required so much fuel, and the pinnacles of human civilizations gradually moved as forests were destroyed.  In Europe the Mediterranean region was supplanted by the German and Frankish lands.  In the Middle East the main power center became [[Anatolia]] with the once dominant Mesopotamia its vassal.  In China, the economical, agricultural, and industrial center moved from the northern Yellow River to the southern Yangtze, though the political center remained in the north.  In part this is linked to technological developments, such as the mouldboard [[plough]], that made life in once undeveloped areas more bearable.

The civilizations in [[Han Dynasty|China]], [[Kushan Empire|India]], and [[Roman Empire|Mediterranean]], connected by the silk road, became the principal civilizations in Eurasia in early CE times. Later development of Eurasian history of mankind is told in other articles.

Partnership is very important in this area. Usually the representatives of [[US]] and Azerbaijan criticise each other within the [[OSCE]] [[Human Dimension Implementation Meeting]]s. US is the biggest partner of Azerbaijan in the fight against human trafficking.
In March 2016, the [[US embassy]] and the Main Department for Combating Human Trafficking in Azerbaijan, organised an international conference.
During the conference, carried out the coordination of joint activities of law enforcement agencies. One of the programs carried out by the United States in Azerbaijan aimed at combating human trafficking.
With the support of the [[United States]], steps were taken to create of shelters for victims of human trafficking and to increase the capacity of the labor of the people there.
The United States  joins forces with Azerbaijan in the fight against human trafficking in harmony with the priorities identified in the Concept of "Azerbaijan 2020: vision to future".

'''Inter Press Service''' ('''IPS''') is a global [[news agency]]. Its main focus is the production of news and analysis about events and processes affecting economic, social and political [[international development|development]]. The agency largely covers news on the [[Global South]], [[civil society]], and [[globalization]].

==History==
Inter Press Service was set up in 1964 as a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] international [[cooperative]] of journalists. Its founders were the Italian journalist [[Roberto Savio]] and the Argentine political scientist Pablo Piacentini. Initially, the primary objective of IPS was to fill the information gap between Europe and Latin America after the political turbulence following the [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959 (Giffard in Salwen and Garrison, 1991).&lt;ref name=history&gt;IPS, [http://www.ips.org/institutional/get-to-know-us-2/our-history/ Our history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the network expanded to include all continents, beginning with a Latin American base in Costa Rica in 1982,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and extended its editorial focus. In 1994, IPS changed its legal status to that of a "public-benefit organization for development cooperation".

In 1996 IPS had permanent offices and correspondents in 41 countries, covering 108 nations. It had as subscribers over 600 print media, around 80 news agencies and database services, and 65 broadcast media, in addition to over 500 NGOs and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard, C. Anthony (1998) "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6dNtpqQa1zoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA194 Alternative News Agencies]" In: Boyd-Barrett, O. and Rantanen, T.; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News''. London: Sage Publications, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
[[File:Talk Nation Radio - 2011-02-28 Dahr Jamail, Uprisings and Oil in the Middle East.vorb.oga|thumb|Dahr Jamail, on his Al Jazeera and Inter Press Service News reports]]
IPS’s stated aims are to give prominence to the voices of [[marginalization|marginalized]] and vulnerable people and groups, report from the perspectives of [[developing country|developing countries]], and to reflect the views of [[civil society]]. The mainstreaming of [[gender]] in reporting and the assessment of the impacts of [[globalization]] are a priority.

IPS may be unique in its concentration on [[developing country|developing countries]] and the strong relationships with [[civil society]]. For this reason, IPS has even been termed the probably "largest and most credible of all 'alternatives' in the world of news agencies" (Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen, 1998: 174/5),&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver and Rantanen, Terhi; eds. (1998) ''The Globalization of News'' London: Sage Publication&lt;/ref&gt; being the "first and only independent and professional news agency which provides on a daily basis information with a Third World focus and point of view" (Boyd-Barrett and Thussu, 1992: 94; cf. Giffard, 1998: 191; Fenby, 1986).

Despite all the laudable aims, it is, however, important to see that IPS has never possessed the resources to be a major player in the international media landscape. Because of its focus on longer background pieces focusses on development issues impacting the lives of people in the South instead of concise news, it is yet to be a news provider for mainstream media in developed countries. In fairness to IPS, mainstream media often rely on their own fly in and out journalists from where IPS reports.

==Legal status==
IPS is registered as an international [[non-profit organization|not-for-profit association]]. It has 'general' NGO consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] at the [[United Nations]], and the [[OECD]] status of [[Official Development Assistance|"ODA eligible international organization"]].

==Organizational structure==
Five editorial desks coordinate the network of journalists around the world: Montevideo (regional bureau for Latin America), Berlin-London (Europe and the Mediterranean), Bangkok (Asia and the Pacific), New York (North America and the Caribbean) and Johannesburg (Africa). Most of IPS's journalists and editors are native to the country or region in which they are working.

IPS receives funding from various sources: through its subscribers and media clients, as beneficiary of multilateral and national development cooperation programmes, and as recipient of project financing from [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]]. It is not, as most other agencies, financed by a country or a group of newspapers. Hence, the agency’s budget is comparatively small. Still it manages to be "roughly the sixth largest international news-gathering organization" (Rauch, 2003: 89).

==IPS's role in the mediascape==
The actual role of IPS in the international [[mediascape]] is hard to assess. Clipping services are expensive, and do not exist in many countries where IPS is strong. Additionally, in some countries news agencies are not credited in bylines. One study by the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for media coverage of the FAO in 1991 found that of the nearly 3000 clippings with news agency bylines, 13% credited IPS, making it the third-most cited agency. IPS reports were collected from 138 different publications in 39 countries - more countries than any other agency. IPS was particularly strong in Latin America - 72% of clippings from Latin America with news agency bylines came from IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Giffard (1998:195)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Health Partnership''' ('''IHP+''') is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. International organizations, bilateral agencies and country governments all sign the IHP+ Global Compact. They commit to putting the principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development cooperation into practice in the health sector. IHP+ achieves results by mobilizing national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national health strategy. Partners aim to hold one another to account. This global initiative is administered by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].

Faster progress to achieve results requires governments, CSOs, the private sector and especially international development partners to take action. The most critical areas for action for development partners have become known as the "seven behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/article/seven-behaviours-how-development-partners-can-change-for-the-better-325359/&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/leaders-re-focus-ihp-to-improve-health-aid-coordination Global health agency leaders] recently endorsed these seven behaviours, and have met five times in order to discuss obstacles to progress in these key seven areas. As of June 2014, Agencies have committed to action in one specific area: streamlining the measurement of results and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/ihp-news/article/global-health-agency-leaders-take-steps-towards-a-common-set-of-health-indicators-327655/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Principles of the IHP+ ==
Improving health and health services involves governments, health workers, civil society, parliamentarians and other stakeholders working together. In developing countries, money for health comes from both domestic and external resources. This means that governments must also work with a range of international development partners. These partners are increasing in number, use different funding streams and have diverse bureaucratic demands. As a result, development efforts can become fragmented and resources can be wasted.

In 2005, the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]] set out principles for making aid more effective. These principles include ownership, alignment, harmonization, mutual accountability and managing for results. In 2011, the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness signaled a shift in thinking from traditional aid effectiveness to a broader, more inclusive approach to development cooperation, a greater emphasis on considering domestic and external resources together, and on results.

IHP+ began in September 2007 in order to put these international principles into practice in the health sector and accelerate progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-06/britain-launches-global-healthcare-plan-for-poor/661550?section=world "Britain launches global healthcare plan for poor countries"], [[ABC News (Australia)]], September 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200709051541.htm "Brown launches global health plan"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Ramakant, [http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7329 "International Health Partnership to strengthen health systems"], ''[[Asian Tribune]]'', September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has worked to encourage more inclusive national health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes, more unified support to national plans through country compacts, one monitoring &amp; evaluation platform to track strategy implementation, greater mutual accountability, improved civil society engagement and financial management harmonization and alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== IHP+ Partners ==
IHP+ has partners from around the world including developing countries, civil society organizations (CSOs) and development partners. Originally, 26 signatories including 7 countries, 18 bilateral and multilateral partners, and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] signed the IHP+ [[Pact|Global Compact]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/CMS_files/documents/ihp_global_compact_EN.pdf PDF signed version from the Global Compact]&lt;/ref&gt; for achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals. The Global Compact is the initiative's foundational global document that is signed by all partner countries, international agencies and bilateral donors when they join the IHP+. The Compact sets out the goals and approach of IHP+ and contains collective and individual commitments by signatories to adhere to agreed aid effectiveness principles. Signatories agree to support country and government-led national health plans. Currently, there are 63 signatories to the Global Compact (as of June 2014).

[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/CSO/0,,contentMDK:20127718~menuPK:288622~pagePK:220503~piPK:220476~theSitePK:228717,00.html Civil Society Organizations] (CSOs) play an important role in IHP+ at both the country and global level. At the country level, civil society encompasses patient groups, health workers, medical or health unions and associations, faith-based organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s, community-based organizations, academic institutions, media, advocacy groups, refugees, women, youth and other neglected or vulnerable groups. At the global level, civil society is included in IHP+ governance bodies. The IHP+ Steering Committee and Reference Group each include one northern and one southern civil society representative, who draw on a Civil Society Consultative Group of up to 12 civil society members, to discuss IHP+ related issues and activities. IHP+ thematic working groups also include civil society representation. IHP+ supports a small grants programme for southern CSOs called the [http://www.healthpolicyactionfund.org/ Health Policy Action Fund]. This is designed to strengthen the capacity of southern CSOs so that they can engage more meaningfully with national health policy processes.

In addition, IHP+ collaborates with related initiatives including Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA); the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA); H8;&lt;ref&gt;H8 stands for Health eight, an informal gathering of eight international agencies coming together to improve their effectiveness in providing health in Low and Middle Income Countries.Composed of the [[WHO]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNAIDS]], [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], [[GAVI Alliance]], [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], and the [[World Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Metrics Network]] (HMN); Providing for Health (P4H); and follow-up activities of the Commission for Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health (COIA).

==Key Issues==
IHP+ encourages inclusive ways of working, and governments, CSOs, private organizations, parliaments and international development partners all have a role to play in the process. IHP+ works in six key areas to change the way we work together in countries: 
* Inclusive health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes.  [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/key-issues/national-health-planning-jans/ JANS] is a shared, systematic approach to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a national health strategy.
* Country compacts. These are negotiated agreements in which governments and development partners make commitments on ways to support implementation of a national health strategy. Compacts include agreements on aid modalities, and management and monitoring arrangements.
* Harmonization with and alignment to country financial management systems. Joint Financial Management Assessments and Joint Fiduciary Arrangements are useful tools for strengthening &amp; aligning with government systems and reducing transaction costs. These also help to improve the use of scarce resources and increase transparency and accountability.
* Monitoring &amp; Evaluation. IHP+ supports the development of one common country platform to monitor and review the implementation of a national health strategy. 
* Mutual Accountability. Building stronger health systems means holding each other to account for decisions and actions. IHP+ encourages greater mutual accountability by monitoring progress on partners' commitments. The [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/tools/ihpresults-survey-tool/ IHP+ results] monitors progress on commitments made, with indicators based on the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]].
* Civil society engagement. CSOs are crucial partners in countries and at the global level. They make important contributions to planning, implementing and monitoring national health strategies.

IHP+ also works to enable greater south-south knowledge exchange. Experience of working with multiple partners to deliver better results is growing. IHP+ is fostering more systematic approaches to learning with and across countries, through existing networks where possible.

The '''International Vaccine Institute''' (IVI) is an independent, nonprofit, international organization that was founded on the belief that the health of children in developing countries can be dramatically improved by the use of new and improved [[vaccines]]. Working in collaboration with the international scientific community, public health organizations, governments, and industry, IVI is involved in all areas of the vaccine spectrum – from new vaccine design in the laboratory to vaccine development and evaluation in the field to facilitating sustainable introduction of vaccines in countries where they are most needed.

Created initially as an initiative of the [[United Nations Development Programme|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), IVI began formal operations as an independent international organization in 1997 in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. Currently, IVI has 35 countries and the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. The Institute has a unique mandate to work exclusively on vaccine development and introduction specifically for people in developing countries, with a focus on neglected diseases affecting these regions.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1992, Dr. Seung-Il Shin, then Senior Health Advisor for the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]], initiated a study to explore the feasibility of establishing an international institute devoted to vaccine research and development within the framework of the Children’s Vaccine Initiative (CVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/seung-il-shin|title=Seung Il Shin - Founder &amp;amp; Board Director @ Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the results of Dr. Shin’s feasibility study, in 1993 the UNDP adopted a formal proposal to establish the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). In 1994, following a call for proposals to host IVI in the Asia Pacific region, the UNDP and the Republic of Korea reached an agreement to host the center in Seoul. In 1995, UNDP opened an interim IVI office on the campus of Seoul National University and the Institute began its initial work and organizational development.

[[File:Establishment Agreement Signing.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Signing of the IVI Establishment Agreement]]

=== Foundation ===
In 1995 and 1996, the UNDP and the South Korean government jointly developed the basic framework and Constitution of IVI. In order to establish IVI as an independent international organization, the UNDP and Korean government elected to establish the institute through an intergovernmental agreement of UN member states, as sanctioned in the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties of 1969]].

On October 28, 1996, the IVI Establishment Agreement opened for signatures at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City. Representatives of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Panama]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Romania]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] were the first to sign the agreement, followed shortly thereafter by [[Senegal]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

In 1997 more countries followed, with [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sweden]], [[Tajikistan]], and Turkey signing the Agreement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IX-3&amp;chapter=9&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 1997, The IVI Establishment Agreement entered into force following the submission of instruments of ratification by South Korea, Sweden, and Uzbekistan. The IVI Establishment Agreement entered the [[Treaty series#United Nations|United Nations Depository of Treaties]] under Chapter IX. HEALTH, section 3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 24, 1998 the IVI Headquarters Agreement was signed at a formal ceremony at [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP headquarters]] by South Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Hon. [[Hong Soon-young|Hong Soon-Young]] and IVI Board Chairman, [[Barry Bloom|Dr. Barry Bloom]]. The Headquarters Agreement established IVI as a legal entity with diplomatic immunity in South Korea,, becoming the first international organization to be headquartered in South Korea. In accordance with IVI’s independent status, the Institute formally separated from the UNDP in 1998. 
[[File:IVI Building (1).jpg|thumb|290x290px|IVI Headquarters]]

=== Headquarters building ===
The IVI headquarters building, located in [[Seoul National University]]’s Research Park in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was designed by a consortium consisting of [[Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers|Samwoo Architects]] of South Korea and [https://www.payette.com/ Payette Associates] of Boston, USA. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in 2003. The building houses laboratories, animal facilities, offices, an auditorium, and a library. A separate 1,300m² pilot plant facility, intended for the production of test lots of vaccines for training and evaluation purposes, was constructed but never completed due to a lack of funding.

== Previous activities ==

=== Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) 2000-2006 ===

IVI’s first major initiative, Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) was a program of research and technical assistance to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines against [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[shigellosis]] into public health programs for the poor in developing countries. From 2000 to 2006, IVI’s DOMI program carried out vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, and research studies in [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. &amp;nbsp;At the conclusion of the DOMI program, IVI synthesized the diverse epidemiological, clinical, economic, and behavioral findings of these studies in order to facilitate informed decision-making by policymakers at the national level on the use of vaccines against the diseases targeted by DOMI. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] was the primary funder of the DOMI program with a US$40 million contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2003-2004|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2005|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea.|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI typhoid ====

The DOMI Typhoid program was initiated to address the barriers of access to [[Typhoid vaccine|typhoid vaccines]] in the developing world and to accelerate the introduction of modern typhoid vaccines in countries where they were needed. DOMI Typhoid utilized the Vi-[[Polysaccharide]] (Vi-PS) vaccine because it is easily and inexpensively produced by manufacturers in developing countries, it is given in a single dose, and it is relatively thermostable. DOMI Typhoid operated in five study sites: [[Hechi|Heichi]], China; [[Kolkata]], India; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Karachi]], Pakistan; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI experts conducted disease surveillance, disease burden studies, cost-of-illness studies, socio-behavioral studies, and vaccine demonstration projects. IVI presented the accumulated evidence from DOMI Typhoid in case studies to officials in each host country. As a result, policymakers in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam agreed to introduce school-based typhoid vaccination campaigns on a pilot basis. Results from China uncovered a previously unknown growing incidence rate of [[Paratyphoid fever|paratyphoid A]] infections in China’s [[Guangxi|Guangxi province]], which led to IVI launching its Paratyphoid in China project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DOMI cholera ====

The DOMI Cholera program sought to develop and accelerate the use of an affordable [[cholera vaccine]] in [[cholera]]-endemic countries. DOMI Cholera operated from five study sites: [[Matlab (Bangladesh)|Matlab]], Bangladesh; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Kolkata]], India; [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], Mozambique; and [[Huế|Hue]], Vietnam. From these sites, IVI conducted disease burden, economic, and socio-behavioral studies and cholera vaccination campaigns. The studies found a high demand for cholera vaccine and high incidence rates (3-9/1,000) in children 5 years old and younger. IVI’s vaccination campaign in Beira saw more than 44,000 children and adults receive the internationally-licensed Dukoral vaccine. In Kolkata, IVI vaccinated more than 67,000 children and adults using an oral cholera vaccine produced by Vietnam’s [http://www.vabiotech.com.vn/?lang=en VaBiotech.] At the onset of DOMI Cholera, the only internationally licensed cholera vaccine available was Dukoral, but at $90 for the two-dose series, this vaccine was too expensive for public use in many of the poorest developing countries. VaBiotech’s cholera vaccine, originally developed by Vietnam’s [http://nihe.org.vn/en/home-c10902.htm National Institute of Health and Epidemiology] following a technology transfer from the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]], was not licensed for international use but showed great promise as a low-cost vaccine for the developing world. As a result, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] provided IVI with additional funding to establish the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CVI) with the goal of reformulating the VaBiotech vaccine for international use. 

==== DOMI shigellosis ====
IVI established the DOMI [[Shigellosis]] program with the ultimate goal of accelerating the development and introduction of a safe and protective shigella vaccine to control epidemic and endemic disease. Between 2000 and 2004, the DOMI Shigella program ran disease surveillance sites in 6 locations across Southeast Asia: [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh; [[Hebei]], China; [[Karachi]], Pakistan and neighboring villages; [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Nha Trang]], Vietnam; and [[Saraburi Province]], Thailand. The program enhanced understanding of what an effective shigella vaccine will need and established an accurate disease burden in the countries where it operated. The program first evaluated an oral shigella vaccine (SC602) in Bangladesh, but it failed to elicit an immune response. The high disease burden, serotype diversity, and high levels AMR discovered at IVI's surveillance sites underscored the need for a vaccine that protects against all common strains of the disease. As a result, IVI’s Division of Laboratory Sciences initiated a multiyear program to sequence the Shigella genome and identify common proteins in different Shigella species that could be used to develop a vaccine against all common strains of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2006-2007|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2008|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotavirus Diarrhea Program 1999-2010 ===
IVI initiated the Rotavirus Diarrhea Program to provide policymakers in developing countries with the disease burden evidence and economic data needed to ensure the inclusion of [[Rotavirus vaccine|rotavirus vaccines]] in their [[Vaccination schedule|national immunization programs]]. Running from 1999 to 2010, the program conducted disease surveillance and economic studies in [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Vietnam]]. In 2007, in collaboration with Vietnam’s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), IVI conducted a Phase II trial of [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK’s]] RotaRix rotavirus vaccine in [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa]], Vietnam. &amp;nbsp;In 2009, in collaboration with NIHE, [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], IVI completed a phase III trial of Merck’s RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine in [[Nha Trang]] Vietnam, where it vaccinated 900 infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2009|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2010|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 

=== Dengue Vaccine Programs 2002-2016 ===

==== The Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI''')''' ====
The Pediatric [[Dengue fever|Dengue]] Vaccine Initiative was a product development partnership launched by IVI to accelerate the introduction of safe and effective [[dengue vaccine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for children in dengue-endemic countries. From 2002 to 2010, PDVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. PDVI made many contributions to dengue vaccine development, including:

* Development of a dengue vaccine partnership and global research network to develop, evaluate, and introduce dengue vaccines. Working with Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]], the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institute of Health]], and [[Sanofi Pasteur]], PDVI provided technical advice and support for the efficacy and clinical trials of their respective dengue vaccine candidates and established a consortium of field sites in dengue-endemic countries across Asia and the Americas.
* Establishment of two regional Dengue Prevention Boards in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas to disseminate information and make recommendations regarding the control of dengue through immunization.
* Collaboration with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to develop a free user-friendly software, [http://www.denguevaccine.org/resource-search/?types%5B%5D=2 DenguEcon], which can be used by policymakers to determine the economic impact of dengue.

In 2010, PDVI transitioned into the Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IVI Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|publisher=International Vaccine Institute|year=2011|isbn=|location=IVI Library, Seoul, South Korea|pages=22-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dengue Vaccine Initiative (DVI) ====
The successor to PDVI, the Dengue Vaccine Initiative was an IVI-led consortium with the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sabin Vaccine Institute|the Sabin Vaccine Institute]], the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR), and the [http://ivac.jhu.edu/ International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. DVI continued the work of PDVI and focused on laying the groundwork for dengue vaccine decision-making and vaccine introduction in endemic areas. Each consortium member was responsible for a specific component: WHO – information and guidance documents, and regulatory training activities; Johns Hopkins – dengue vaccine financing and strategic demand forecasting; and Sabin – communications and advocacy. Besides leading the consortium, IVI generated evidence for decision-making such as disease burden, country vaccine introduction cases and a global investment case. From 2010 to 2016, DVI operated in [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cambodia]], [[Colombia]], [[Gabon]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. From 2013-2015, with funding from [[Germany]]’s [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education &amp; Research (BMBF)]], IVI continued support for preclinical development of dengue vaccines by Brazil’s [[Instituto Butantan|Butantan Institute]] and Vietnam’s VaBiotech. After the 2016 licensure of [[Sanofi|Sanofi Pasteur’s]] Dengvaxia vaccine, the DVI project came to a close and its IVI staff transitioned to a new project, the Global Dengue &amp; [[Aedes]]-Transmitted Disease Consortium (GDAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ivi.int/wp-content/uploads/kboard_attached/11/201610/IVI%20Annual%20Report%202015.pdf|title=IVI 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ivi.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6/15/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signatory Countries of the IVI ===
As of January 2011, IVI includes 40 countries and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)''' as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty without the need for ratification, acceptance of approval. These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve '''Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines''', and the '''World Health Organization (WHO)'''. A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.

In short, in addition to the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]], 40 countries include [[Bangladesh]], [[Liberia]]**, [[Republic of Korea]]**, [[Bhutan]], [[Malta]], [[Romania]], [[Brazil]]**, [[Mongolia]]**, [[Senegal]], [[China]]**, [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]]**, [[Ecuador]]**, [[Nepal]], [[Sweden]]**, [[Egypt]], [[Netherlands]]**, [[Tajikistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Oman]]**, [[Thailand]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]]**, [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]], [[Panama]], [[Uzbekistan]]**, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vietnam]]**, [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Peru]]**, [[Lebanon]], [[Philippines]]**, [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[India]], [[Kuwait]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], and [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivi.int/about_us/signatory_countries.html Governance. 'Signatory Countries.']&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of the world's '''longest wooden ships'''. The vessels are sorted by ship length including [[bowsprit]], if known.

Finding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.

A further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the "length of the topmost deck" – the "length on deck" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the "length between perpendiculars" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including [[jibboom]] and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The longest length for comparing ships, the total "[[Length overall|overall]]" length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.

The longest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted New England gaff schooner ''Wyoming'', had a "total length" of {{convert|137|m|ft}} (measured from tip of jib boom (30 metres) to tip of spanker boom (27 metres) and a "length on deck" of {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}-difference is due to her extremely long jib boom of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} her out-board length being {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

[[Image:Midgard (Sö 56, Fyrby).jpg|350px|right|thumb|The runes ''a:miþkarþi'', [[Old Norse]] ''à Miðgarði'', meaning "in Midgard" – "in Middle Earth", on the [[Fyrby Runestone]] (Sö 56) in [[Södermanland]], [[Sweden]].]]

'''Midgard''' (an anglicised form of [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Miðgarðr}}; [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Middangeard}}, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''Midgård'', [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|Middilgard}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Mittilagart}}, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Midjun-gards''; "middle yard") is the name for [[Earth]] (equivalent in meaning to the Greek term {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|οἰκουμένη]]}}, "inhabited") inhabited by and known to [[mannaz|humans]] in early Germanic cosmology, and specifically one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|middangeard}}
{{wiktionary|𐌼𐌹𐌳𐌾𐌿𐌽𐌲𐌰𐍂𐌳𐍃}}
This name occurs in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] literature as {{lang|non|Miðgarðr}}. In [[Old Saxon]] ''[[Heliand]]'' it appears as {{lang|osx|Middilgard}} and in [[Old High German]] poem ''[[Muspilli]]'' it appears as {{lang |goh|Mittilagart}}. The [[Gothic language|Gothic]] form {{lang|got|Midjungards}} is attested in the [[Gospel of Luke]] as a translation of the Greek word {{lang |grc|[[Ecumene|οἰκουμένη]]}}. The word is present in [[Old English]] epic and poetry as {{lang |ang|Middangeard}}; later transformed to {{lang |enm|Middellærd}} or {{lang |enm|Mittelerde}} ("[[Middle-earth (disambiguation)|Middle-earth]]") in [[Middle English]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Midgard | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | contribution = Midgard}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these forms are from a [[Common Germanic]] ''*midja-gardaz'' (''*meddila-'', ''*medjan-''), a compound of ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/midjaz|*midja-]]'' "middle" and ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/gardaz|*gardaz]]'' "yard, enclosure".
In early Germanic cosmology, the term stands alongside ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' ([[Old English]] ''weorold'', [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld''), from a [[Common Germanic]] compound ''*wira-alđiz'', the "age of men".&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir E. (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology''.  Leiden: Brill. p. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse==
Midgard is a realm in [[Norse mythology]]. It is one of the Nine Worlds—the only one that is completely visible to mankind (the others may intersect with this visible realm but are mostly invisible). Pictured as placed somewhere in the middle of [[Yggdrasil]], Midgard is between the land of [[Niflheim]]—the land of ice—to the north and [[Muspelheim]]—the land of fire—to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midgard|title=Midgard {{!}} Norse mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midgard is surrounded by a world of water, or ocean, that is impassable. The ocean is inhabited by the great sea serpent [[Jörmungandr]] (Miðgarðsormr), who is so huge that he encircles the world entirely, grasping his own tail. The concept is similar to that of the [[Ouroboros]]. Midgard was also connected to Asgard, the home of the gods, by the [[Bifröst]], the rainbow bridge, guarded by [[Heimdallr]].

In Norse mythology, ''Miðgarðr'' became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the giant [[Ymir]] as a defense against the [[Jötunn|Jotuns]] who lived in [[Jotunheim]], east of ''Manheimr'', the "home of men", a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the giant [[Ymir]], the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his [[Ymir's blood|blood]] the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Aurgelmir's skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull.

[[Image:Sö 56, Fyrby.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Fyrby Runestone.]]
According to the [[Eddas]], Midgard will be destroyed at [[Ragnarök]], the battle at the end of the world. Jörmungandr will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plane of [[Vígríðr]], following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea, only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again.

Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the [[Viking Age]] [[runestone]] poem from the inscription [[Fyrby Runestone|Sö 56]] from Fyrby:

The [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] form {{lang|sv|Midgård}} or {{lang|da|Midgaard}}, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{lang|no|Midgard}} or {{lang|no|Midgård}}, as well as the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] form {{lang|is|Miðgarður}}, all derive from the Old Norse term.

==Old and Middle English==
The name ''middangeard'' occurs six times in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', and is the same word as Midgard in [[Old Norse]]. The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term [[Oikoumene]], as referring to the known and inhabited world.

The concept of Midgard occurs many times in [[Middle English]]. The association with ''earth'' (OE ''eorðe'') in Middle English ''middellærd'', ''middelerde'' is by [[popular etymology]]; the continuation of ''geard'' "enclosure" is ''[[yard (land)|yard]]''. An early example of this transformation is from the [[Ormulum]]:

::''þatt ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i þiss middellærd''

::that our Lord wanted / be born in this middle-earth.

The usage of "[[Middle-earth]]" as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to ''middangeard'' and ''[[Éarendel]]'' in the Old English poem ''[[Crist]]''.

==Old High German==
''Mittilagart'' is mentioned in the 9th-century [[Old High German]] ''[[Muspilli]]'' (v. 54) meaning "the world" as opposed to the sea and the heavens:
::''muor varsuuilhit sih, suilizot lougiu der himil,''
::''mano uallit, prinnit mittilagart''

::Sea is swallowed, flaming burn the heavens,
::Moon falls, Midgard burns

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">A '''mutual recognition agreement''' ('''MRA''') is an international agreement by which two or more countries agree to recognize one another's [[conformity assessment]]s.
A '''mutual recognition arrangement''' is an international arrangement based on such an agreement.

MRAs have become increasingly common since the formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.  They have been forged within and among various [[trade bloc]]s, including [[APEC]] and the [[European Union]].

MRAs are most commonly applied to goods, such as various [[quality control]] MRAs.  However, the term is sometimes applied to agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications as well.

Accreditation Bodies, under the [[International Accreditation Forum]] use the term ''Multilateral Recognition Agreements'' in a similar sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLA Purpose |url=https://www.iaf.nu/articles/Purpose/15 |website=IAF |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The goal of the Pacific Health Summit is to connect science, industry, and policy for a healthier world. Traditionally, the main work of the Summit has been an annual meeting, where top decision makers convene to discuss how to realize the dream of a healthier future through the effective utilization of scientific advances, combined with industrial innovation and appropriate policies. In autumn of 2012 on the heels of its eight major conference, the Summit shifted its focus from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the past themes and concrete outcomes. As it has since 2005, the Summit will continue to provide a year-round forum for world leaders to grapple with problems and solutions, share best practices, and forge effective collaborations.

==History==
The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the [http://www.trff.org/ Russell Family Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Summit-hopes-to-spark-talks-on-Earth-s-health-1162197.php "Summit hopes to spark talks on Earth’s health", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 12/19/2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner [[Leland H. Hartwell]], businessman and philanthropist George F. Russell Jr., Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation [[William H. Gates Sr.]], and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research’s Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf About the Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302222048/http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference. 

Birt, founding Executive Director of the Summit, stepped down from his role as NBR’s Center for Health and Aging Director in 2009, and from his role as Executive Director in 2012, handing the mantle to Claire Topal, the Summit's Managing Director, who ran the Summit and managed the team from 2009-2012. She now serves as Senior Advisor for International Health to NBR. Nualchan Sakchalathorn, the Summit’s Project Director, served on the Summit team from 2007-2012.

Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 [[Tachi Yamada]], then President of Global Health at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization. 

In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, [[Sir Mark Walport]], joined our Executive Committee. Both [[Sir William Castell]], Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting.

Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and [[Craig Mundie]], Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting. 

Out of this initial foundation of leadership, the Summit grew into one of the world's premier global health gatherings every year. In 2012, eight years after the inaugural meeting, which was never designed to take place in perpetuity, global health is in an exciting new place. The Summit’s interactive format has proliferated, and decision-makers across all sectors and geographies are collaborating on all the critical global health issues the Summit sought to address: health technology, pandemic flu, MDR-TB, vaccines, malnutrition, maternal and newborn health, and many more. While the Summit is proud of eight years of transformational conversations, countless new friendships, and exciting partnerships, there is still much work to do – and so much momentum on which to build. NBR is looking forward and excited to build on the Summit’s legacy in the years to come.

==Early life and education==
Fugelli was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, on December 7, 1943. He studied medicine at [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Barbara Casassus. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32737-X Obituary Per Fugelli.] The Lancet, Volume 390, No. 10107, p2032, 4 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1971–73 Fugelli was a general practitioner in [[Værøy]] and [[Røst]], and from 1977 to 1980 in [[Porsanger]]. During this time he earned his PhD and graduated in 1978. In 1984, he became a Professor of [[General Practice]] at the [[University of Bergen]], where he stayed until 1992. He became a Professor of [[social medicine]] at University of Oslo´s Institute of Health and Society. In 2013, he became Emeritus.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1993 Fugelli wrote: "The patient Earth is sick. Global environmental disruptions can have serious consequences for human health. It's time for doctors to give a world diagnosis and advise on treatment," &lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; predating the founding of [[planetary health]]. He is the subject of the documentary ''I die'' by filmmaker [[Erik Poppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nfi.no/eng/film?name=per-fugelli--i-die&amp;id=1859|title=Per Fugelli - I die|last=|first=|date=|work=Norwegian Film Institute|access-date=2018-08-29|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary boundaries''' is a concept involving Earth system processes which contain environmental boundaries, proposed in 2009 by a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]]. The group wanted to define a "safe operating space for humanity" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the [[private sector]], as a precondition for [[sustainable development]]. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the [[Industrial Revolution]] have become the main driver of global environmental change. 

According to the paradigm, "transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-to planetary-scale systems."&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=iss_pub|title=Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity|year=2009|authors=Rockström et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth system process boundaries mark the safe zone for the planet to the extent that they are not crossed. As of 2009, two boundaries have already been crossed, while others are in imminent danger of being crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, {{Harvnb|Nature|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockstrom09"/&gt;

==History of framework==
[[File:Planetary Boundaries.png|thumb|Planetary boundaries diagram of 2009.]]

In 2009, a group of [[Earth system science|Earth system]] and [[environmental science|environmental scientists]] led by [[Johan Rockström]] from the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]] and [[Will Steffen]] from the [[Australian National University]] collaborated with 26 leading academics, including [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel]] laureate [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] and the [[German Chancellor]]'s chief climate adviser [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] and identified nine "planetary life support systems" essential for human survival, attempting to quantify how far seven of these systems had been pushed already.  They estimated how much further humans can go before [[planetary habitability]] is threatened.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Estimates indicated that three of these boundaries—[[climate change]], [[biodiversity]] loss, and the biogeochemical flow boundary—appear to have been crossed. The boundaries were "rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps" which interact in complex ways that are not yet well understood. Boundaries were defined to help define a "safe space for human development", which was an improvement on approaches aiming at minimizing [[Human impact on the environment|human impacts]] on the planet.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; The 2009 report&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt; was presented to the General Assembly of the [[Club of Rome]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|2009}} (presentation).&lt;/ref&gt; An edited summary of the report was published as the featured article in a special 2009 edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|others|2009b}}.  &lt;!--

In 2015, a second paper was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' to update the Planetary Boundaries concept&lt;ref name="SteffenEtAl2015" /&gt; and findings were presented at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, January 2015.

A 2018 study, co-authored by Rockström, calls into question the international agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures set forth in the [[Paris Agreement]].  The scientists raise the possibility that even if [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are [[Climate change mitigation|substantially reduced]] to limit warming to 2 degrees, that might be the  "threshold" at which self-reinforcing [[climate feedbacks]] add additional warming until the [[Climate|climate system]] stabilizes in a [[Climate state#Hothouse|hothouse climate state]]. This would make parts of the world uninhabitable, raise sea levels by up to {{convert|60|m|ft}}, and raise temperatures by {{convert|4-5|C-change}} to levels that are higher than any [[interglacial]] period in the past 1.2 million years. Rockström notes that whether this would occur "is one of the most existential questions in science." Study author Katherine Richardson stresses, "We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2 °C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions. This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1810141115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115|journal=PNAS|title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene|authors=Steffen et al.|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state|work=The Guardian|title=Domino-effect of climate events could push Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-08-07|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Terra.png|thumb|The planet [[Earth]] is a finite system, which means it has limits.]]

===The idea===
The idea that our planet has limits, including the burden placed upon it by human activities, has been around for some time. In 1972, ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' was published. It presented a model in which five variables: [[world population]], industrialization, pollution, food production, and [[resources depletion]], are examined, and considered to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only [[linear function|linear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meadows|others|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the report was widely dismissed, particularly by economists and businessmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer|Nørgård|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Vuuren|Faber|2009}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Graham Turner from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) published "A comparison of ''The Limits to Growth'' with thirty years of reality".&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|2008}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the "standard run" limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time."&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner says these reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model.&lt;ref name="Turner 2008"/&gt; In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report", and said that it "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nørgård|Peet|Ragnarsdóttir|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote box
| quote = With few exceptions, economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world, where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts. The very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report ''The Limits to Growth'' was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists. However, this conclusion was mostly based on false premises.

''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the {{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1987 by United Nations' [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]]. It tried to recapture the spirit of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference]]. Its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions. It introduced the famous definition for [[sustainable development]]:

{{quote|"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."|''{{Harvnb|Brundtland Report|1987}}''}}

Of a different kind is the approach made by [[James Lovelock]]. In the 1970s he and [[microbiologist]] [[Lynn Margulis]] presented the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia theory or hypothesis]], that states that all [[organisms]] and their [[inorganic]] surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}; {{Harvnb|Lovelock|Margulis|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature ([[homeostasis]]). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'', he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of [[greenhouse gas]]es made by humans, is producing [[global warming]].

===From Holocene to Anthropocene===
{{Main|Anthropocene}}

{{quote box
| quote = Our planet’s ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities.

The [[Holocene]] began about 10,000 years ago. It is the current [[interglacial]] period, and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dansgaard|others1993}}; {{Harvnb|Petit|others|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Rioual|others|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This stability and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van der Leeuw|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rockström ''et al.'', we "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and how we have organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Since the [[industrial revolution]], according to [[Paul J. Crutzen|Paul Crutzen]], Will Steffen and others, the planet has entered a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]].

==Nine boundaries==
'''Thresholds and  boundaries'''

The ''threshold'', or climatological [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable (like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produces a large, possibly catastrophic, change in the response variable (global warming).

The threshold points are difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range is defined as the ''boundary''. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

The proposed framework lays the groundwork for shifting approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative [[Externality|externaliti]]es, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if major [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental change]] on a global scale is to be avoided

Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due to the risk of crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt [[environmental change]] within [[continent]]al- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration in the atmosphere &lt; 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[radiative forcing]]); [[ocean acidification]] (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] levels); [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric [[Ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] from a pre-industrial level of 290 [[Dobson Unit]]s); [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen (N) cycle]] (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 35 Tg N/yr) and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus (P) cycle]] (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background [[weathering]] of P); global freshwater use (&lt; 4000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (&lt; 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of &lt; 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are [[Air pollution|chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading]].

===On the framework===
{{quote box
| quote = &lt;center&gt;'''From the  [[Stockholm Memorandum]]'''&lt;/center&gt; Science indicates that we are transgressing planetary boundaries that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000 years. Evidence is growing that human pressures are starting to overwhelm the Earth’s buffering capacity. Humans are now the most significant driver of [[global change]], propelling the planet into a new geological epoch, the [[Anthropocene]]. We can no longer exclude the possibility that our collective actions will trigger tipping points, risking abrupt and irreversible consequences for human communities and ecological systems.

[[Christopher Field]], director of the [[Carnegie Institution|Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology]], is impressed: "This kind of work is critically important. Overall, this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone."&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the conservation biologist [[Stuart Pimm]] is not impressed: "I don’t think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things... The notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content. In what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable?"&lt;ref name="Zimmer 2009"/&gt; and the environmental policy analyst [[William C. Clark|Bill Clark]] thinks: "Tipping points in the earth system are dense, unpredictable... and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators. It follows that... 'safe operating spaces' and 'planetary boundaries' are thus highly suspect and potentially the new 'opiates'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]] queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all. He thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. "Management based on thresholds, although attractive in its simplicity, allows pernicious, slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely."&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlesinger|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the 'limits to growth' debate. "As a scientific organizing principle, the concept has many strengths ... the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers, giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change. They also provide benchmarks and direction for science. As we improve our understanding of Earth processes and complex inter-relationships, these benchmarks can and will be updated ... we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeply—and urgently—about planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Molden|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ocean chemist]] Peter Brewer queries whether it is "truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved ... they may become just another stick to beat citizens with. Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example: it is likely that a large fraction of people on Earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer. How can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits? ... food is not optional."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brewer|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says the "description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea. We need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present Holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change ... Their paper has profound implications for future governance systems, offering some of the 'wiring' needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources. The planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that, like human rights and representative government, environmental change knows no borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate change policy advisor [[Adele Morris]] thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds. "Staying within a 'safe operating space' will require staying within all the relevant boundaries, including the electorate’s willingness to pay."&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box
| quote = In summary, the planetary boundary concept is a very important one, and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the '[[limits to growth]]'. Importantly, this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in Earth-system processes. As such, it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats, such as climate change.

Elsewhere in their proceedings, panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of "planetary boundaries": "Planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution [...] The planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the "North" to tell the "South" not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves... This language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Sherpa 3 meeting|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UN Agenda 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''UN Daily News''. For example, the [[UNEP]] Executive Director [[Achim Steiner]] states that the challenge of agriculture is to "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's [[Ecological footprint|footprint]] beyond planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/news/dh/pdf/english/2011/01062011.pdf Sustainable agriculture key to green growth, poverty reduction] ''UN Daily News'', 1 June 2011, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Yearbook 2010 also repeated Rockström's message, conceptually linking it with [[ecosystem management]] and [[Sustainable Governance Indicators|environmental governance indicators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|UNEP|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Budapest Declaration}}; {{Harvnb|Greenfield|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in the [[European Environment Agency]] synthesis report ''The European environment – state and outlook 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|Henrichs|others|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate change====
[[File:Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global annual average temperatures over the years 1880 to 2009.png|thumb|300px|right|The black line shows the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the period 1880–2008. Red bars show temperatures above and blue bars show temperatures below the average temperature. Year-to-year temperature fluctuations are due to natural processes, such as the effects of [[El Niño]], [[La Niña]], and the eruption of large volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USGCRP|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of the difference between the incoming [[Irradiance|radiation energy]] and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth. Positive radiative forcing results in warming. From the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing, averaging about 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, "[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change]". &lt;!-- Same link, formerly titled "Figure SPM.2". --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate scientist [[Myles Allen]] thinks setting "a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 °C." He says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can "meaningfully claim to control", and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C of warming.&lt;ref name="Allen 2009"/&gt;

Adele Morris, policy director, Climate and Energy Economics Project, [[Brookings Institution]], makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view. She puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus.  She favors a system of [[carbon tax|green-house gas emissions tax]], and [[emissions trading]], as ways to prevent global warming. She thinks that too-ambitious objectives, like the boundary limit on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, may discourage such actions.&lt;ref name="Morris 2010"/&gt;

====Biodiversity loss====
According to the biologist [[Cristián Samper]], a " boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Samper|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation ecologist Gretchen Daily claims that "it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation, taken alone, are doomed to fail. Nature reserves are too small, too few, too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. The challenge is to make conservation attractive—from economic and cultural perspectives. We cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet. We depend on nature for food security, clean water, climate stability, seafood, timber, and other biological and physical services. To maintain these benefits, we need not just remote reserves but places everywhere—more like 'ecosystem service stations.' A few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development. The Costa Rican government is paying landowners for [[ecosystem services]] from tropical forests, including carbon offsets, hydropower production, biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty. [[China]] is investing $100 billion in "ecocompensation," including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration. The country is also creating "ecosystem function conservation areas" that make up 18 percent of its land area.  Colombia and South Africa have made dramatic policy changes, too. Three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success. One: new science and tools to value and account for [[natural capital]], in biophysical, economic and other terms [...] Two: compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy. Three: cooperation among governments, development organizations, corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daily|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|380px|right|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
Since the industrial revolution, the Earth's [[nitrogen cycle]] has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle. "Human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the Earth´s terrestrial processes combined. Much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones, is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms, or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere."&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers, lakes and the sea, where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems. For example, fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the Gulf of Mexico has damaged [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp fisheries]] because of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The biogeochemist [[William H. Schlesinger|William Schlesinger]]  thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late. He says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable, and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger 2009"/&gt;

With regard to nitrogen, the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist Robert Howarth says: "Human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe. The single largest contributor is fertilizer use. But the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions, such as the northeastern U.S. The solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently. Hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix; their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped. (Emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling.) Nitrogen emissions from U.S. power plants could be greatly reduced, too, if plants that predate the Clean Air Act and its amendments were required to comply; these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce.

In agriculture, many farmers could use less fertilizer, and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent. Runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn’s roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year. In addition, nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops, such as rye or wheat, which can help the soil hold nitrogen. These crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils, mitigating climate change. Better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn; nitrogen losses are many times lower. Nitrogen pollution from [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations|concentrated animal feeding operations]] (CAFOs) is a huge problem.

As recently as the 1970s, most animals were fed local crops, and the animals’ wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer. Today most U.S. animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away, making it “uneconomical” to return the manure. The solution? Require CAFO owners to treat their wastes, just as municipalities must do with human wastes. Further, if we ate less meat, less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed. Eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal. The explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution. Several studies have suggested that if mandated U.S. ethanol targets are met, the amount of nitrogen flowing down the [[Mississippi River]] and fueling the Gulf of Mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent. The best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn. If the country wants to rely on biofuels, it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity; nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howarth|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phosphorus ====
{{Further|Peak phosphorus}}
With regard to phosphorus, the ocean engineer David Vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental [[phosphorus cycle|flow of phosphorus]] "would be the natural flux: seven million metric tons per year (Mt/yr). To hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 Mt/yr, we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus [...] The flow could be reduced with existing technologies... [lowering] the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 Mt/yr, not very much above the natural flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaccari|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global [[phosphorus]] production rate is reached. Phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neset|Cordell|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some researchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50–100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cordell|Drangert|White|2009|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]

====Ocean acidification====
[[Ocean acidification|Surface ocean acidity]] has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution. About one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms [[carbonic acid]]. This acidity inhibits the ability of corals, shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons. [[Cascade effect (ecology)|Knock-on effects]] could have serious consequences for [[fish stock]]s. This boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries, since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The ocean chemist Peter Brewer thinks "ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in pH, and these may need boundaries too."&lt;ref name="Brewer 2009"/&gt;

The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks "the main tactics are raising energy efficiency, switching to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, and as they die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage ... Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doney|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land use====
[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|350px|right|Europe land use map. Human land uses include arable farmland (yellow) and pasture (light green)]]

Across the planet, forests, wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other [[land use]]s, impacting freshwater, carbon and other cycles, and reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

The environment advisor Steve Bass says research tells us that "the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors. For example, the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways, integrated into the landscape. The boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is, in practice, a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors' overall scientific proposition. Instead, the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss. This would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bass|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth systems scientist Eric Lambin thinks that "intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops ... We can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation, freshwater depletion and urban sprawl. This step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices, especially in developing countries. The need for farmland can be lessened, too, by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain, encouraging slower population growth, ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lambin|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freshwater====
[[File:PeakWaterAquifer.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Overexploitation of [[groundwater]] from an [[aquifer]] can result in a [[peak water]] curve.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palaniappan|Gleick|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human pressures on global [[freshwater]] systems are having [[Water crisis|dramatic effects]]. The [[Water cycle|freshwater cycle]] is another boundary significantly affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; Freshwater resources, such as lakes and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). [[Overexploitation]] occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer [[Overdrafting|depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html "Underlying Causes of Deforestation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |date=11 April 2001 }} UN Report.{{who|date=December 2011}}  &lt;!--  **This is a _web page_ that purports to be a UN report, but lacking any information as to where the original may be found.  This is NOT a relible source, and should be removed.** --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to [[peak oil|oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2005}}; {{Harvnb|Sandford|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a [[Hubbert peak|Hubbert-like peak]]. A modified [[Hubbert curve]] applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref name="Palaniappan 2008"/&gt;

The [[hydrologist]] [[Peter Gleick]] comments: "Few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of [[peak water]]. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world's major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California's Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred ... The good news is that the potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gleick|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologist David Molden says "a global limit on water consumption is necessary, but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous."&lt;ref name="Molden 2009"/&gt;

====Ozone depletion====
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|right|During 21–30 September 2006 the average area of the Antarctic ozone hole was the largest ever observed]]

The stratospheric [[ozone layer]] protectively filters [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) from the [[Sun]], which would otherwise damage biological systems. The actions taken after the [[Montreal Protocol]] appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt; However, in 2011, according to a paper published in ''Nature'', the boundary was unexpectedly [[Ozone depletion#Arctic ozone hole|pushed in the Arctic]]; "... the fraction of the Arctic vortex in March with total ozone less than 275 Dobson units (DU) is typically near zero, but reached nearly 45%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manney|Santee|27 others|2011|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel laureate in chemistry, [[Mario J. Molina|Mario Molina]], says "five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion, but it doesn't represent a tipping point".&lt;ref name="Molina 2009"/&gt;

The physicist David Fahey says that as a result of the Montreal Protocol "stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100. The gain has relied, in part, on intermediate substitutes, notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Ongoing success depends on several steps:
* "Continue observing the ozone layer to promptly reveal unexpected changes. Ensure that nations adhere to regulations; for example, the HCFC phaseout will not be complete until 2030.
* "Maintain the Scientific Assessment Panel under the protocol. It attributes causes of changes in the ozone layer and evaluates new chemicals for their potential to destroy ozone and contribute to climate change.
* "Maintain the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel. It provides information on technologies and substitute compounds that helps nations assess how the demand for applications such as refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam insulation can be met while protecting the ozone layer.
"The two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together. Climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere, and compounds such as HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases. For example, the large projected demand for HFCs could significantly contribute to climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahey|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric aerosols====
[[Aerosol]] particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence [[monsoon]] and global [[atmospheric circulation]] systems. Some aerosols produce clouds which cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back to space, while others, like soot, produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse, warming the Earth. On balance, anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative [[radiative forcing]] (cooling influence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} &lt;!-- Needs author, chapter, and section, with links. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide each year, aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths. Aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries, but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockholm Resilience Centre|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

====Chemical pollution====
Some chemicals, such as [[persistent organic pollutants]], [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and [[radionuclide]]s, have potentially irreversible [[Bioaccumulation|additive]] and synergic effects on biological organisms, reducing fertility and resulting in permanent [[genetic damage]].  Sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations. This boundary seems important, although it is hard to quantify.&lt;ref name="Stockholm Resilience Centre 2009"/&gt;

A Bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur, have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoh|Kawai|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction among boundaries==
A planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries. Rockström ''et al.'' 2009 did not analyze such interactions, but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels.

For example, the [[land use]] boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached, causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture. At a regional level, water resources may decline in Asia if [[deforestation]] continues in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]].  Such considerations suggest the need for "extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries."&lt;ref name="Rockström 2009"/&gt;

Another example has to do with [[coral reef]]s and [[marine ecosystem]]s. In 2009, {{Harvtxt|De'Ath|Lough|Fabricius|2009}} showed that, since 1990, calcification in the reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef|Great Barrier]] that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years (14% in less than 20 years). Their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of [[aragonite]] is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate. {{Harvtxt|Bellwood|others|2004}} explored how multiple stressors, such as increased nutrient loads and [[fishing pressure]], move corals into less desirable ecosystem states. {{Harvtxt|Guinotte|Fabry|2008}} showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life, particularly species "that build skeletons, shells, and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate. "Increasing temperatures, surface [[UV radiation]] levels and ocean acidity all stress marine [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rockström|Steffen|26 others|2009}}, [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/appendix1.pdf Appendix 1. Supplementary Information].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
{{quote box
| quote = The concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable. It threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth. The fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the [ [[Rio+20]] ] conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo. Had planetary boundaries remained in the statement, the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end. Planetary boundaries will not go away. The intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the Earth System cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking, denial, or omission from official sustainable development conference statements. It is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit.

In 2012 [[Kate Raworth]] from [[Oxfam]] noted the Rockstrom concept does not take [[human population growth]] into account.&lt;ref&gt;Raworth, Kate (2012) [http://www.oxfam.org.nz/resources/onlinereports/dp-a-safe-and-just-space-for-humanity-130212-en.pdf A safe and just space for humanity: Can we live within the doughnut?] Oxfam Discussion Paper, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested social boundaries should be incorporated into the planetary boundary structure, such as jobs, education, food, access to water, health services and energy and to accommodate an environmentally safe space compatible with [[poverty eradication]] and "rights for all".

The United Nations secretary general [[Ban Ki-moon]] endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 March 2012, when he presented the key points of the report of his High Level Panel on Global Sustainability to an informal [[Plenary session|plenary]] of the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref name=ITIN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/science-at-rio-20/news/rio-20-zero-draft-accepts-planetary-boundaries-.html Rio+20 zero draft accepts 'planetary boundaries'] ''SciDev.Net'', 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ban stated: "The Panel’s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality, to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable, while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sgsm14166.doc.htm Secretary-General Highlights Key Points...] ''United Nations News'', 16 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was incorporated into the so-called "zero draft" of the outcome of the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] to be convened in Rio de Janeiro 20–22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/content/documents/370The%20Future%20We%20Want%2010Jan%20clean%20_no%20brackets.pdf Zero draft of the outcome document] RIO+20, United Nations Conference on Sustainability Development.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference, "partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development. It is also, say observers, because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted, and needed to be challenged, weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at UN negotiations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/features/your-guide-to-science-and-technology-at-rio-20-1.html Your guide to science and technology at Rio+20] ''scidev.net'', 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetary boundary framework was updated in 2015.&lt;ref name="SteffenEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that three of the boundaries (including climate change) might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed; these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries. In the paper, the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale.

===Agricultural and nutritional impacts===
[[File:Planetary boundaries of agriculture and nutrition.png|thumb|400px|Environmental impacts of agriculture and nutrition within the framework of planetary boundaries according to Meier (2017)&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meier|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Human activities related to agriculture and nutrition globally contribute to the transgression of four out of nine planetary boundaries. Surplus nutrient flows (N, P) into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are of highest importance, followed by excessive land-system change and biodiversity loss. Whereas in the case of biodiversity loss, P cycle and land-system change, the transgression is in the zone of uncertainty—indicating an increasing risk (yellow circle in the figure), the N boundary related to agriculture is more than 200% transgressed—indicating a high risk (red marked circle in the figure).&lt;ref name="Meier 2017"/&gt;

The [[Pulse Polio|Pulse Polio immunisation campaign]] eliminated [[polio]] from [[India]].]]
The '''pulse vaccination strategy''' is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range, until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Nokes, DJ., Swinton, J. The control of childhood viral infections by pulse vaccination.IMA J Math Appl Med Biol. 1995;12(1):29-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nokes, DJ., Swinton, J. Vaccination in pulses: a strategy for global eradication of measles and polio?Trends Microbiol. 1997 Jan;5(1):14-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical model ==
Where T= time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time. This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as
:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Further, by setting {{math|1=''I'' = 0}}, one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Shulgin, BV., Stone L., Agur, Z. Pulse vaccination strategy in the SIR epidemic model. Bull Math Biol. 1998 Nov;60(6):1123-1148.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S^*(t) = 1- \frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}  &lt;/math&gt;

and that the eradication condition is:&lt;ref&gt;Stone L., Shulgin, B., Agur, Z. Theoretical examination of the pulse vaccination policy in the SIR epidemic model. Mathematical and computer modelling, 2000, 31 (4), 207-215&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recorded history''' or '''written history''' is a [[history|historical narrative]] based on a written record or other documented communication. It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded history begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.

The interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.

== Prehistory ==
{{Further|History of writing}}

[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell1922"&gt;Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.

[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.

More complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vinča signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became "true writing"&lt;ref&gt;Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].

===East Asia===
In China, the earliest history was recorded in [[oracle bone script]] which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = "综述", 中国考古学报第5册(Acta Archaeologica Sinica)|publisher=《考古学报》编辑部|year = 1951 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|B.C. }}, is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }}. The ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551–479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.

[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|B.C. }}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.

===Europe===
[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 B.C. – c. 425 B.C. )&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |date=1979 |page=5|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history" composing his [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5" /&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |date=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C. ]]According to [[John Tosh]], "From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history."&lt;ref name="Tosh59"&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].

===South Asia===
In Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]]. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) "Island Chronicles" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.

A companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' "Lesser Chronicle", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.

The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tripāṭhī|editor1-first=Śrīdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nāga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.

===Middle East===
In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

==Methods of recording history==
While recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|deadurl=no|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.&lt;ref name=Tosh-58-59&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical method===
The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name="primary source guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=User Education Services|title=Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=12 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, "direct, un-mediated information about the object of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historians use other types of sources to understand history as well. [[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. [[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.&lt;ref name="primary source guide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | title=Glossary, Using Information Resources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | archivedate=28 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }} ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | title=Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | archivedate=12 February 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SINPO''', an [[acronym]] for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, and Overall''', is a Signal Reporting Code used to describe the quality of [[radiotelegraph]] transmissions. SINPFEMO, an acronym for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, frequency of Fading, Modulation, dEpth, and Overall''' is used to describe the quality of [[Radiotelephone|radiotelephony]] transmissions.  SINPFEMO code consists of the SINPO code plus the addition of three letters to describe additional features of radiotelephony transmissions. These codes are defined by ''Recommendation ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/sm/R-REC-SM.1135-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf|title=ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO code is most frequently used in [[reception report]]s written by [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]]. Each letter of the code stands for a specific factor of the signal, and each item is graded on a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 stands for nearly undetectable/severe/unusable and 5 for excellent/nil/extremely strong).

The code originated with the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] (a predecessor to the ITU-R) in 1951, and was widely used by BBC shortwave listeners to submit signal reports, with many going so far as to mail audio recordings to the BBC's offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Engineering Division Monnograph, Number 43: September 1962|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO and SINPFEMO are the official signal reporting codes for international civil aviation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedures for Air Navigation Services: ICAO Abbreviations and Codes|url=http://www.icao.int/NACC/Documents/Meetings/2014/ECARAIM/REF03-ICAOCodes.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ITU-R.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of the SINPO code can be subjective and may vary from person to person. Not all [[shortwave]] listeners are conversant with the SINPO code and prefer using plain language instead.

==SINPO code explained==

; S ([[Signalling (telecommunication)|Signal]] strength) : The relative strength of the transmission.
; I ([[Interference (communication)|Interference]]) : Interference from other stations on the same or adjacent frequencies (man-made noise).
; N ([[Signal noise|Noise]]) : The amount of atmospheric noise.
; P ([[Radio propagation|Propagation]]) : Whether the signal is steady or fades from time to time.
; O (Overall merit) : An overall score for the listening experience under these conditions.

Each category is rated from 1 to 5 with 1 being 'unusable' or 'severe' and 5 being 'perfect' or 'nil'. MANY raters misunderstand the code and will rate everything either 55555 or 11111 when in reality both extremes are unusual in the extreme.  '55555' essentially means 'perfect reception akin to a local station' while that is occasionally possible, when talking about long-distance short-wave reception, it is almost never the case.

Another common mistake in rating is presenting an 'O' higher than any previously rated element. By definition, a station cannot present 'perfect' reception if there is any Noise or Interference or Fading present. In other words, it is NOT 'perfect local quality' reception if any of those things are present.

==Examples of SINPO code applied==

In responding to a shortwave reception, the SINPO indicates to the transmitting station the overall quality of the reception.

The SINPO code in normal use consists of the 5 rating numbers listed without the letters, as in the examples below:

* '''54554''' – This indicates a relatively clear reception, with only slight interference; however, nothing that would significantly degrade the listening experience.
* '''33433''' – This indicates a signal which is moderately strong, but has more interference, and therefore deterioration of the received signal.

Generally, a SINPO with a code number starting with a 2 or lower would not be worth reporting, unless there is no noise, interference or loss of propagation, since it would be likely the signal would be unintelligible.

Although the original SINPO code established technical specifications for each number (i.e., a number 3 in the P column meant a fixed number of fades per minute), these are rarely adhered to by reporters.  The 'S' meter displays the relative strength of the received RF signal in decibels; however, this should not be used as the sole indication of signal strength, as no two S meters are calibrated exactly alike, and many lower-priced receivers omit the S meter altogether. References to a "SINFO" code may also be found in some literature. In this case, the 'F' stands for Fading, instead of 'P' for Propagation, but the two codes are interchangeable. It was presumed that the average listener would be more familiar with the meaning of "fading" than "propagation". A simple way to ensure the rating applied is useful is to rate the "O" column first based on the intelligibility of the station. If you can understand everything easily, the station will rate a 4 or higher. If you have to work hard, but can understand everything '3' is the appropriate rating. If you cannot understand everything although you put great effort into it, a '2' is appropriate, and if you cannot understand the programming at all '1' is the appropriate rating.

Some listeners may not know how to distinguish between the 'I' which indicates interference from adjacent stations, and the 'N' which describes natural atmospheric or man-made noise; also for some listeners, the rating for 'Propagation' may not be completely understood. As a result of this confusion, many stations suggest the SIO code&amp;nbsp;– a simpler code which makes the limitations noted above not relevant. Despite this, some books and periodicals maintain the SINPO code is the best for DX reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception Reports: Reporting Code - Writing Useful Reception Reports |url=http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |accessdate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107033211/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Schøyen Collection''' is the largest private [[manuscript]] collection in the world, mostly located in [[Oslo]] and London. Formed in the 20th century by [[Martin Schøyen]], it comprises manuscripts of global [[provenance]], spanning 5,000 years of history. It contains more than 13,000 manuscript items; the oldest is about 5,300 years old. There are manuscripts from 134 different countries and territories, representing 120 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/aboutus.html ''The Schøyen Collection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of manuscripts—geographic, linguistic, textual and material—even more than its size makes the Schøyen Collection unique. The collection has a website with many items illustrated and described. The provenance of the various cuneiform materials held by the Schøyen Collection remains subject to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html|title=Review of: The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts, 2 vols|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=BMCR|via=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharp power''' is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country.  Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.  

Sharp power is distinguished from [[soft power]], which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion.  Soft power policies can include [[student exchange program|student exchanges]] and the sponsoring of [[Cultural diplomacy | cultural and sporting events]].  Sharp power is also distinct from [[hard power]], which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions.  Hard power can include [[war | military force]], [[economic sanctions]], and [[coercive diplomacy|diplomatic threats]].  

The term "sharp power" was coined in November of 2017 by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and published in an article in [[Foreign Affairs | Foreign Affairs Magazine]], to describe aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Sharp Power:  How Authoritarian States Project Influence|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-11-16/meaning-sharp-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig|date=Nov 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded [[RT (TV network) | RT News Network]] and the Chinese state-sponsored [[Confucius Institute | Confucius Institute educational partnerships]] as examples of sharp power.  According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them."  

Since 2018, the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings.  Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spokesman addresses Western charges of China using 'sharp power'.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLe5ZF6qeX8|publisher=China Global Television Network|date=Mar 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social forum''' is an open meeting place for [[civil society|civil society organizations]] and individuals opposed to [[neoliberalism]] and what its participants regard as the domination of the world by [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|title=Charter of Principles|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first social forum was the [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) held in January 2001 in [[Porto Alegre]]. It was designed as a counter forum to the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) held in [[Davos]] at the same time. While the WSF regards the WEF as a meeting of the political and economic elite of the world, the WSF gathers social forces and aims to promotes [[democratization]] and [[social justice]].

After the first WSF, the social forum idea was replicated across the world in various transnational, national, and local social forums. Most, though not all, social forums adhere to the WSF Charter of Principles,&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; drawn up by the International Council of the WSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|title=Who organizes it|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006125543/http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of participants in the social forums has reflected the diversity of the [[Global Justice Movement]] (or [[Anti-Globalization Movement]]).

'''South America''' &lt;!-- Only put in English phonetics, do not list "South America" in other languages --&gt; is a [[continent]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It may also be considered a [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]],&lt;ref name=britannica-southamerica&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/555844/South-America|title = South America|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is how it is viewed in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like [[Latin America]] or the [[Southern Cone]]) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal||url=https://www.academia.edu/12944490 |title=Unveiling the South American Balance  |journal=Estudos Internacionais  2(2): 215–232.|date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-08|last1=Schenoni |first1=Luis L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]), a [[Regions of France|part]] of [[France]] ([[French Guiana]]), and a non-sovereign area (the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] though this is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed]] by Argentina). In addition to this, the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Panama]] may also be considered part of South America.

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}} has been estimated at more than {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South America}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} South America [[List of continents by population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades Brazil has also concentrated half of the region's GDP and has become a first regional power.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the [[patagonia|far south]] are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Orinoco]], and [[Paraná River|Paraná]] flow. Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].

The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long [[European colonization of the Americas|history of colonialism]], the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and societies and states reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].

South America occupies the southern portion of the [[Americas]].

South America's major mineral resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicuña]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the Earth's [[species]].

Brazil is the largest country in South America, encompassing around half of the continent's land area and population. The remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions: The [[Andean States]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Southern Cone]].

===Outlying islands===

Traditionally, South America also includes some of the nearby islands. [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]], [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]] and are often considered part of the continent. Geo-politically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America, since they are more distant on the [[Caribbean Plate]], even though [[San Andrés (island)|San Andres]] and [[Providencia Island|Providencia]] are politically part of [[Colombia]] and [[Aves Island]] is controlled by [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="North America Atlas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w South America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49) |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other islands that are included with South America are the [[Galápagos Islands]] that belong to [[Ecuador]] and [[Easter Island]] (in [[Oceania]] but belonging to [[Chile]]), [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] (both Chilean) and [[Tierra del Fuego]] (split in between Chile and [[Argentina]]). In the Atlantic, [[Brazil]] owns [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], and the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] are governed by the [[United Kingdom]], whose sovereignty over the islands is [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed by Argentina]].

===Climate===

[[File:South America Köppen Map.png|thumb|[[Map]] of South America according to [[Köppen climate classification]]]]
[[File:Tropical cyclones 1945 2006 wikicolor.png|thumb|Map of all tropical cyclone tracks from 1945 to 2006.]]
The distribution of the average temperatures in the region presents a constant regularity from the [[30th parallel south|30° of latitude south]], when the isotherms tend, more and more, to be confused with the degrees of latitude.&lt;ref name="Climate"&gt;O CLIMA. In: ''Atlas Mundial''. São Paulo: Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo, 1999, pp. 20–21 {{ISBN|85-06-02889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate latitudes, [[winter]]s are milder and [[summer]]s warmer than in North America. Because its most extensive part of the continent is in the equatorial zone, the region has more areas of equatorial plains than any other region.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The average annual temperatures in the Amazon basin oscillate around 27&amp;nbsp;°C, with low thermal amplitudes and high [[rainfall]] indices. Between the [[Maracaibo Lake]] and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an [[equatorial climate]] of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

The distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[tropical cyclone]]s are practically unknown in the South Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Pacific coast of Colombia and northern Ecuador are rainy regions. The Atacama Desert, along this stretch of coast, is one of the driest regions in the world. The central and southern parts of Chile are subject to [[extratropical cyclone]]s, and most of the Argentine [[Patagonia]] is [[desert]]. In the [[pampas]] of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;

Important factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="Climate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Know.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=2015-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}
[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or ''Cave of the Hands'', in Argentina]]
South America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].

The first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/&gt;

South American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicuña]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.&lt;ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/&gt;

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]

The rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.

One of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chavín]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chavín de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

In the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&amp;nbsp;– 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&amp;nbsp;– 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.

Around the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600–1200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.

The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Cañari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chimú Empire]] (1300–1470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000–1450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).

Holding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

The [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.

===European colonization===
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]

In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.

The treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46° 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca–Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) – to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&amp;nbsp;– caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.

[[File:Desembarque de Pedro Álvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865–1939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].]]
[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]
[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]

The Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.

Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.

[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.

===Slavery in South America===
{{Slavery}}
{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}
[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]

Indigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.&lt;ref&gt;Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760–1810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informações disponíveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravidão no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D.

While the Portuguese, English and French settlers enslaved mainly African blacks, the Spaniards became very disposed of the natives. In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on so-called [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.

After independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.

The European [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.

Many cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]], who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.

The independence of South America was secured by [[Simón Bolívar]] (Venezuela) and [[José de San Martín]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bolívar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Martín led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.

In the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom João VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Pará]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].

===Nation-building and fragmentation===

[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]

The newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre Ríos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).

The first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], led by a [[caudillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the "Republic" in its title, [[Francisco Ramírez (governor)|General Ramírez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The "country" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.

In 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].

Later in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina and Brazil in the [[Paraguayan War]].

South American history in early [[19th century]] was built almost exclusively on wars. Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.

In 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.

Between 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.

Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that "there were two Argentines": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[Río de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.&lt;ref name="Latin America’s Wars"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1844&amp;dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%20twenty-five&amp;f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.

The Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano López]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/|title=A Guerra do Paraguai – História – Resumo|first=Daniel Arantes Loverde|last=daniel@loverde.com.br|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884. Chile annexed territories of both countries leaving Bolivia with no path to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002203/http://pt.shvoong.com/humanities/h_history/1628182-am%C3%A9rica-latina-guerra-pac%C3%ADfico/ | title=América Latina – Guerra do Pacífico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new century, as wars became less violent and less frequent, Brazil entered into a small conflict with Bolivia for the possession of the Acre, which was acquired by Brazil in 1902. In 1917 Brazil declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and join the allied side in the [[World War I]], sending a small fleet to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and some troops to be integrated with the British and French troops. Brazil was the only South American country that fought in WWI.&lt;ref&gt;Woodard, James P.

In the same year Paraguay declared [[Chaco War|war]] on Bolivia for possession of the Chaco, in a conflict that ended three years later with Paraguay's victory. Between 1941 and 1942 Peru and Ecuador [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War|fought decisively for territories]] claimed by both that were annexed by Peru, usurping Ecuador's frontier with Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|date=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in this period the first naval battle of [[World War II]] was fought on the continent, in the [[Battle of the River Plate|River Plate]], between British forces and German submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill 1948, pp. 525–526.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans still made numerous attacks on Brazilian ships on the coast, causing Brazil to declare war on the [[Axis powers]] in 1942, being the only South American country to fight in this war (and in both World Wars). Brazil sent naval and air forces to [[Battle of the Atlantic|combat German and Italian submarines]] off the continent and throughout the South Atlantic, in addition to sending an [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] to fight in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]].&lt;ref name="Ibidem Maximiano 2011"&gt;Ibidem Maximiano, Bonalume, Ricardo N. &amp; Bujeiro, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. MacCann – 'Estudios Interdisciplinarios de America Latina y el Caribe', vol. 6, No. 2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ibidem Maximiano 2011"/&gt;

A brief war was fought between Argentina and the UK in 1982, following an Argentine invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]], which ended with an Argentine defeat. The last international war to be fought on South American soil was the 1995 [[Cenepa War]] between Ecuador and the Peru along their mutual border.

===Rise and fall of military dictatorships===

[[File:Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes firing a broadside.jpg|left|thumb|The Brazilian [[Minas Geraes-class battleship|''Minas Geraes'' class]] kindled an [[South American dreadnought race|Argentine–Brazilian–Chilean naval arms race]].]]

Wars became less frequent in the 20th century, with Bolivia-Paraguay and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars. Early in the 20th century, the [[ABC Powers|three wealthiest South American countries]] engaged in [[South American dreadnought race|a vastly expensive naval arms race]] which was catalyzed by the introduction of a new warship type, the "[[dreadnought]]". At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hough, ''The Big Battleship'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. {{oclc|8898108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810–1987'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. {{ISBN|0-87021-295-8}}. {{oclc|15696006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].

Argentina and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

Colombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens.

Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cambridge History of Latin America", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-39525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.

[[File:Presidentes unasur (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Presidents of [[UNASUR]] member states at the Second Brasília Summit on 23 May 2008.]]
[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Bethell|title=Bibliographical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39525-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|date=November 2012}} The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards [[Integration of Latin America|regional integration]], with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the [[Andean Community]], [[Mercosur]] and [[Unasur]]. Notably, starting with the election of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela in 1998, the region experienced what has been termed a [[pink tide]] – the election of several leftist and center-left administrations to most countries of the area, except for the Guianas and Colombia.

Historically, the Hispanic countries were founded as Republican dictatorships led by [[caudillo]]s. [[Brazil]] was the only exception, being a [[constitutional monarchy]] for its first 67 years of independence, until a [[coup d'état]] proclaimed a republic. In the late 19th century, the most democratic countries were [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]],{{sfn|Lira 1977, Vol 2|p=9}} [[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891–1925)|Chile]], Argentina and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R1KBWX329uIC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=late+19th+century+most+democratic+South+American+countries#v=onepage&amp;q=late%2019th%20century%20most%20democratic%20South%20American%20countries&amp;f=false|title=Toward Pro-poor Policies: Aid, Institutions, and Globalization|last=Tungodden|first=Bertil|last2=Stern|first2=Nicholas Herbert|last3=Stern|first3=Nicholas|last4=Kolstad|first4=Ivar|date=2004|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0821353882|location=|page=219|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interwar period, nationalism grew stronger on the continent, influenced by countries like [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist Italy]]. A series of authoritarian rules broke out in South American countries with views bringing them closer to the [[Axis Powers]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennison de Oliveira, "Os soldados alemães de Vargas" Portuguese [Germans against Hitler; "The German soldiers of Vargas" ] 1st Chapter, Jurua print. 2008 {{ISBN|85-362-2076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Vargas Era|Vargas's Brazil]]. In the late 20th century, during the [[Cold War]], many countries became [[military dictatorships]] under American tutelage in attempts to avoid the influence of the Soviet Union. After the fall of the authoritarian regimes, these countries became democratic republics.

During the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with leftist leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Most South American countries are making increasing use of protectionist policies, helping local development.

All South American countries are [[presidential republic]]s with the exceptions of Peru, which is a [[semi-presidential republic]], and [[Suriname]], a [[parliamentary republic]]. [[French Guiana]] is a [[French overseas department]], while the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are British overseas territories. It is currently the only inhabited continent in the world without [[monarchies]]; the [[Empire of Brazil]] existed during the 19th century and there was an unsuccessful attempt to establish a [[Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia]] in southern Argentina and Chile. Also in the twentieth century, [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname]] was established as a constituent kingdom of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and [[Guyana (1966–1970)|Guyana]] retained the [[British monarch]] as [[head of state]] for 4 years after its independence.

Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]], thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/integrate/2008/1029newconsensus.htm |title=Globalpolicy.org |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new political organization, known as [[Union of South American Nations]], seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of [[tariff]]s.

==Demographics==
[[File:South America night.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite view of South America at night from [[NASA]].]]
South America has over {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South America}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million{{UN_Population|ref}} inhabitants and a population growth rate of about 0.6% per year. There are several areas of sparse demographics such as [[tropical forest]]s, the [[Atacama Desert]] and the icy portions of [[Patagonia]]. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Italians]]), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by French, English and Dutch in smaller numbers.

===Language===
[[File:Languages of South America (en).svg|thumb|left|Languages in South America]]

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the most spoken languages in South America, with approximately 200 million speakers each. Spanish is the official language of most countries, along with other native languages in some countries. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of [[Suriname]]; [[English language|English]] is the official language of [[Guyana]], although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and several native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/GY-language.htm|title=The Languages spoken in Guyana|website=Studylands|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is also spoken in the [[Falkland Islands]]. [[French language|French]] is the official language of [[French Guiana]] and the second language in [[Amapá]], Brazil.

[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] of South America include [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile and Colombia; [[Wayuunaiki]] in northern Colombia ([[La Guajira]]) and northwestern Venezuela ([[Zulia]]); [[Guarani language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay and, to a much lesser extent, in Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and [[Mapudungun]] is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile and, more rarely, Argentina. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.

Other languages found in South America include [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela and Chile; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]] in the Argentine [[Patagonia]]. There are also small clusters of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speakers in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Arabic speakers, often of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian people|Syrian]], or [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent, can be found in Arab communities in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0022216X13001156|title=On the Trail and Trial of a Palestinian Diaspora: Mapping South America in the Arab–Israeli Conflict, 1967–1972|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |volume =45|issue =4 |year=2013|pages=751–777|author=Karam, John Tofik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Religion in Latin America}}
{{see also|History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean|Buddhism in Brazil|Islam in Argentina}}

An estimated 90% of South Americans are [[Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx|title=Christians|date=18 December 2012|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (82% [[Roman Catholic]], 8% other Christian denominations mainly traditional [[Protestants]] and [[Evangelicals]] but also [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]), accounting for c. 19% of Christians worldwide.

African descendent religions and Indigenous religions are also common throughout all South America, some examples of are [[Santo Daime]], [[Candomblé]], [[Umbanda]] and [[Encantados]].

[[Crypto-Jews]] or [[Marrano]]s, [[conversos]], and [[Anusim]] were an important part of colonial life in Latin America.

Both Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil figure among the largest [[Jewish population by urban areas|Jewish populations by urban area]].

Japanese Buddhism, [[Shintoism]], and [[Shinto|Shinto-derived]] [[Japanese New Religions]] are common in Brazil and Peru. [[Korean Confucianism]] is especially found in Brazil while Chinese Buddhism and Chinese Confucianism have spread throughout the continent.

[[Kardecism|Kardecist Spiritism]] can be found in several countries.

Genetic admixture occurs at very high levels in South America. In Argentina, the European influence accounts for 65–79% of the genetic background, Amerindian for 17–31% and sub-Saharan African for 2–4%. In Colombia, the sub-Saharan African genetic background varied from 1% to 89%, while the European genetic background varied from 20% to 79%, depending on the region.
In Peru, European ancestries ranged from 1% to 31%, while the African contribution was only 1% to 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3983580 | pmid=24764751 | volume=37 | issue=1 Suppl | title=Interethnic admixture and the evolution of Latin American populations | year=2014 | journal=Genet.

The most populous country in South America is Brazil with {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Brazil}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. The second largest country is Colombia with a population of {{UN_Population|Colombia}}. Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.

While Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are São Paulo, Bogotá, and Lima. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Caracas, Buenos Aires and Salvador.

Five of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater São Paulo|São Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.

South America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.

South America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt; Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.&lt;ref name=wfex/&gt;

Since 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.&lt;ref name="Economy"&gt;O Sistema Econômico / América do Sul. In: ''Atlas Mundial''. São Paulo: Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo, 1999, pp. 26–27, 88–107 {{ISBN|85-06-02889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main agrarian crops are export crops, such as [[soy]] and [[wheat]]. The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

Only Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florianópolis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

Since the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment–factors that favor industry.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.&lt;ref name="Economy"/&gt;

The [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents. The richest 10% receive over 40% of the nation's income in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay,&lt;ref name=share&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.10TH.10|title=Income share held by highest 10%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the poorest 20% receive 3% or less in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.DST.FRST.20/countries|title=Income share held by lowest 20%|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie in the vicinity of skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments; nearly one in nine South Americans live on less than $2 per day (on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis).&lt;ref name=wb2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.2DAY/countries|title=Poverty headcount ratio at $2 a day (PPP) (% of population)|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Americans are culturally influenced by their indigenous peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and waves of immigrants from around the globe.

South American nations have a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[música sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canción]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. {{multiple image

}} People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Español|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.

The [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[João Guimarães Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African–influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.

A wide range of sports are played in the continent of South America, with [[Association football|football]] being the most popular overall, while [[baseball]] is the most popular in Venezuela.

Other sports include [[basketball]], [[cycling]], [[polo]], [[volleyball]], [[futsal]], [[motorsports]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] (mostly in Argentina and Uruguay), [[handball]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[field hockey]], [[boxing]] and [[cricket]].

South America hosted its first [[Olympic Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in 2016 and will host the [[Youth Olympic Games]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 2018.

South America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in [[FIFA World Cup]] history and all winning teams in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).

South America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa América]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa América a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa América).

Also, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.

[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===

Due to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.

The [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Iguaçu and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&amp;nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.

Most of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.

===Transport===

[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Peru]]
[[File:Línea Roja de Mi Teleférico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]

South American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&amp;nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.

Only two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valparaíso]], in Chile, and the Brazil–Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2015-04-02|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&amp;nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Brasilia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.

The Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.
South America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the São Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&amp;nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&amp;nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&amp;nbsp;km.

The two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bahía Blanca]], [[Rosario]], [[Valparaiso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranaguá]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Belém]] and [[Maracaibo]].

In South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo, and large airports, such as [[São Paulo–Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport|São Paulo–Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (São Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Confins International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, Bogotá, Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Belém.

The main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires [[subte]], opened 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=A short history of world metro systems – in pictures|last=Lin|first=Luna|location=London|date=10 September 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/sep/10/-sp-history-metro-pictures-london-underground-new-york-beijing-seoul|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Santiago Metro|Santiago subway]]&lt;ref name="Home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrosantiago.cl/guia-viajero |title=Guía del Viajero |publisher=Metro de Santiago |language=Spanish |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest network in South America, with 103&amp;nbsp;km, while the [[São Paulo Metro|São Paulo subway]] is the largest in transportation, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day&lt;ref name="2014ridership"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/metro/numeros-pesquisa/demanda.aspx |title=Metro – Passengers |publisher=Companhia Do Metropolitano De São Paulo |language=Portuguese |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was voted the best in the Americas. In [[Rio de Janeiro]] was installed the first railroad of the continent, in 1854. Today the city has a vast and diversified system of metropolitan trains, integrated with buses and subway. Recently it was also inaugurated in the city a Light Rail System called [[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail|VLT]], a small electrical trams at low speed, while [[São Paulo]] inaugurated its [[Line 15 (São Paulo Metro)|monorail]], the first of South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!-- Empty reference &lt;ref name="spmetro_about" /&gt;--&gt; In Brazil, an express bus system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which operates in several cities, has also been developed.

The '''1918 influenza pandemic''' (January 1918&amp;nbsp;– December 1920; [[colloquialism|colloquially]] known as '''Spanish flu''') was an unusually deadly [[influenza pandemic]], the first of the two [[pandemics]] involving [[influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 influenza virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/conf/CRC/Grippe_CRC.ppt |title=La Grippe Espagnole de 1918 |format=Powerpoint |language=fr |publisher=[[Institut Pasteur]] |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020243/http://www.pasteur.fr/infosci/conf/CRC/Grippe_CRC.ppt |archive-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It infected 500&amp;nbsp;million people around the world,{{sfn|Taubenberger|Morens|2006}} including people on remote Pacific islands and in the [[Arctic]], and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;million (three to five percent of the world's population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Historical Estimates of World Population|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_history.php|access-date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in [[human history]].{{sfn|Patterson|Pyle|1991}}{{sfn|Billings|1997}}{{sfn|Johnson|Mueller|2002}}

Infectious disease already limited [[life expectancy]] in the early 20th century. But in the first year of the pandemic, life expectancy in the United States dropped by about 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/1918/life_in_1918/health/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026180557/http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/history/1918/life_in_1918/health/index.html|archive-date=2016-10-26|title=The Nation's Health|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services]]|website=www.flu.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/|title=Life Expectancy|website=[[Our World in Data]]|access-date=2016-03-31|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331014445/http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/|archive-date=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608114504/http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-06-08 |title=Life expectancy in the USA, 1900–98 |website=demog.berkeley.edu |access-date=2016-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast, the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/|title=The Influenza Epidemic of 1918|date=|website=Archives.gov|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists offer several possible explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some research suggests that the specific variant of the [[virus]] had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that [[transfection]] in animals caused a rapidly progressive [[respiratory failure]] and death through a [[cytokine storm]] (overreaction of the body's [[immune system]]). It was postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.{{sfn|Barry|2004}}

=== Hypotheses about source ===
Historian [[Alfred W. Crosby]] recorded that the flu originated in the U.S. state of [[Kansas]],{{sfn|Crosby|2003}} and popular writer [[John M. Barry|John Barry]] echoed Crosby in describing [[Haskell County, Kansas|Haskell County]], as the point of origin.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} But already in late 1917, there had been a first wave of epidemic in at least 14 US military camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the US Army infected the World with Spanish Flu|url=http://limpia.centroeu.com/how-the-us-army-infected-the-world-with-spanish-flu/|work=Limpia por dentro|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1917, military pathologists reported the onset of a new disease with high mortality that they later recognized as the flu. The overcrowded camp and hospital&amp;nbsp;— which treated thousands of victims of chemical attacks and other casualties of war&amp;nbsp;— was an ideal site for the spreading of a respiratory virus; 100,000 soldiers were in transit every day. It also was home to a live piggery, and poultry were regularly brought in for food supplies from surrounding villages. Oxford and his team postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated so it could migrate to pigs that were kept near the front.&lt;ref name="Etaples"&gt;Connor, Steve, [https://archive.is/20090808003837/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/flu-epidemic-traced-to-great-war-transit-camp-728112.html "Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp"], ''The Guardian'' (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000.

Earlier hypotheses of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu originated in East Asia, a common area for transmission of disease from animals to humans because of dense living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3455873.stm 1918 killer flu secrets revealed]. ''BBC News.'' 5 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the 1918 flu for the [[Pasteur Institute]], asserted the former virus was likely to have come from China, mutating in the United States near [[Boston]] and spreading to [[Brest, France]], Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world via Allied soldiers and sailors as the main spreaders.&lt;ref&gt;Hannoun, Claude, "La Grippe", Ed Techniques EMC (Encyclopédie Médico-Chirurgicale), Maladies infectieuses, 8-069-A-10, 1993. Documents de la Conférence de l'Institut Pasteur : ''La Grippe Espagnole de 1918''.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, [[Kansas]] (United States), and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.

Political scientist [[Andrew Price-Smith]] published data from the [[Austrian archives]] suggesting the influenza had earlier origins, beginning in Austria in early 1917.{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}

In 2014, historian Mark Humphries of the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] stated that newly unearthed records confirmed that one of the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 [[Chinese Labour Corps|Chinese laborers]] to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the "Spanish" flu.{{sfn|Humphries|2014}}&lt;ref name="Vergano"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140123-spanish-flu-1918-china-origins-pandemic-science-health/ | title=1918 Flu Pandemic That Killed 50 Million Originated in China, Historians Say | work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] | date=January 24, 2014 | access-date=November 4, 2016 | author=Vergano, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published in 2016 in the Journal of the [[Chinese Medical Association]] found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe via Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers.

=== Spread ===
When an infected person sneezes or coughs, more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Irwin W. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Irwin Sherman|title=Twelve diseases that changed our world|date=2007|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-55581-466-3|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close quarters and massive troop movements of [[World War I]] hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.{{sfn|Ewald|1994}}

A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of this flu was increased travel. Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

In the United States, the disease was first observed in [[Haskell County, Kansas]], in January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service's academic journal. On 4 March 1918, company cook Albert Gitchell reported sick at [[Fort Riley]], an American military facility that at the time was training American troops during World War I, making him the first recorded victim of the flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barry JM | title = The site of origin of the 1918 influenza pandemic and its public health implications | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14733617 | pmc = 340389 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5876-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bynum |first=Bill | name-list-format = vanc |date=March 14, 2009 |title=Stories of an influenza pandemic |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(09)60530-4.pdf |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=373 |issue=9667 |pages=885–886 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, 522 men at the camp had reported sick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080521071645/http://www.avian-bird-flu.info/spanishfluepidemic1918.html Avian Bird Flu.

In August 1918, a more virulent strain appeared simultaneously in [[Brest, France]]; in [[Freetown|Freetown, Sierra Leone]]; and in the U.S. in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The [[Allies of World War I]] came to call it the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127100727/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/spanish%20flu%20facts/111285 Channel 4&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– Spanish flu facts].&lt;/ref&gt;

The global [[mortality rate]] from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% of those who were infected died. With about a third of the world population infected, this [[case fatality|case-fatality ratio]] means 3% to 6% of the entire global population died.{{sfn|Taubenberger|Morens|2006}} Influenza may have killed as many as 25&amp;nbsp;million people in its first 25 weeks.

In West Africa the influenza epidemic killed at least 100,000 people in [[Ghana]].{{sfn|Hays|1998}} Tafari Makonnen (the future [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]], Emperor of Ethiopia) was one of the first [[Ethiopia]]ns who contracted influenza but survived.&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;Harold Marcus, ''Haile Sellassie I: The formative years, 1892–1936'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1996), pp. 36f&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| Pankhurst| 1991| pp=48f}} Many of his subjects did not; estimates for fatalities in the capital city, [[Addis Ababa]], range from 5,000 to 10,000, or higher.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1991|p=63}} In [[British Somaliland]], one official estimated that 7% of the native population died.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1991| pp= 51ff}}

This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms, suspected to be caused by [[cytokine storm]]s.{{sfn|Patterson|Pyle|1991}} Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as [[dengue]], [[cholera]], or [[typhoid]]. One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and [[petechia|petechial hemorrhages]] in the skin also occurred".{{sfn|Knobler|2005}} The majority of deaths were from [[bacterial pneumonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacterial Pneumonia Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Influenza Pandemic|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic|website=National Institutes of Health|date=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taubenberger|Reid|Janczewski|Fanning|2001| pp=1829–1839}} a common [[secondary infection]] associated with influenza.

The unusually severe disease killed up to 20% of those infected, as opposed to the usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1%.{{sfn|Taubenberger|Morens|2006}}{{sfn|Knobler|2005}}

=== Patterns of fatality ===
The pandemic mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} This is unusual, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as [[infant]]s (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the [[immunocompromise]]d. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the [[1889–1890 flu pandemic]], known as the Russian flu.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;Hanssen, Olav. Undersøkelser over influenzaens optræden specielt i Bergen 1918–1922. Bg. 1923. 66 s. ill. (Haukeland sykehus. Med.avd.Arb. 2) (Klaus Hanssens fond. Skr. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to historian John M. Barry, the most vulnerable of all&amp;nbsp;– "those most likely, of the most likely", to die&amp;nbsp;– were pregnant women. He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71%.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne MS, Bayatibojakhi S | title = Exploring preterm birth as a polymicrobial disease: an overview of the uterine microbiome | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 5 | pages = 595 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25505898 | pmc = 4245917 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child.{{sfn|Barry| 2004| p= 239 }}

Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]); influenza is usually worse in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Key Facts about Swine Influenza [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts_pigs.htm] accessed 22:45 GMT-6 30 April 2009.

Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a [[cytokine storm]], which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}}

In fast-progressing cases, mortality was primarily from [[pneumonia]], by virus-induced pulmonary [[consolidation (medicine)|consolidation]]. Slower-progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias, and there may have been [[neural]] involvement that led to [[mental disorders]] in some cases. Some deaths resulted from malnourishment.

A study&amp;nbsp;– conducted by He et al.&amp;nbsp;– used a mechanistic modelling approach to study the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation, and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.{{sfn|He|Dushoff|Day|Ma|2011}}

Another study by He et al. used a simple epidemic model, to incorporate three factors, including school opening and closing, temperature changes over the course of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak, to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.{{sfn|He|Dushoff|Day|Ma|2013}}

=== Deadly second wave ===
[[File:USCampHospital45InfluenzaWard.jpg|thumb|[[American Expeditionary Force]] victims of the Spanish flu at U.S. Army Camp Hospital no. 45 in [[Aix-les-Bains]], France, in 1918]]
The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But by  August, when the second wave began in France, Sierra Leone, and the United States,&lt;ref&gt;UK Parliament&amp;nbsp;– http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/88/88.pdf.

As the [[List of American Experience episodes#Season 10 (1997–98)|PBS ''American Experience'': Influenza 1918 episode]] says, October 1918 was the deadliest month of the whole pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War.{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=55}} In civilian life, natural selection favors a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics, health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=63}}

The fact that most of those who recovered from first-wave infections had become [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] showed that it must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in [[Copenhagen]], which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fogarty International Center|url=http://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/Pages/Flu-1918.aspx|title=Summer Flu Outbreak of 1918 May Have Provided Partial Protection Against Lethal Fall Pandemic |publisher=Fic.nih.gov|date=|access-date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the population, the second wave was far more deadly; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches&amp;nbsp;– young previously healthy adults.{{sfn|Gladwell|1997|p=56}}

Even in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by [[steam shovel]] and bodies buried without coffins in many places.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/11/01/8189572/index.htm Viruses of Mass Destruction]",  ''Fortune'', 01 November 2004; accessed 30 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Pacific island]] territories were particularly hard-hit. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was too slow to implement measures to prevent [[SS Talune|ships carrying the flu]] from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the flu reached [[Tonga]] (killing 8% of the population), [[Nauru]] (16%) and [[Fiji]] (5%, 9,000 people).{{sfn|Denoon|2004}}

Worst affected was [[Western Samoa]], formerly [[German Samoa]], which had been [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied by New Zealand]] in 1914. 90% of the population was infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, [[Governor of American Samoa|Governor]] [[John Martin Poyer]] prevented the flu from reaching [[American Samoa]] by imposing a blockade.{{sfn|Denoon|2004}} The disease spread fastest through the higher social classes among the indigenous peoples, because of the custom of gathering oral tradition from chiefs on their deathbeds; many community elders were infected through this process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wishart|first=Skye|date=July–August 2018|title=How the 1918 flu spread|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/how-the-1918-flu-spread/|journal=New Zealand Geographic|volume=|issue=152|pages=23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza, resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%.{{sfn|Rice|2005|p=221}} [[Māori people|Māori]] were 10 times as likely to die as [[pākehā]] (Europeans), because of their poorer and more crowded housing, and rural population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918.

Data analysis revealed 6,520 recorded deaths in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah-Chatham County, Georgia]] (population = 83,252) for the three-year period from January 1, 1917, to December 31, 1919. Of these deaths, influenza was specifically listed as the cause of death in 316 cases, representing 4.85 percent of all causes of death for the total time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plaspohl|first1=Sata S.|last2=Dixon|first2=Betty T.|last3=Owen|first3=Nyssa | name-list-format = vanc |title="The Effect of the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic on Mortality Rates in Savannah, Georgia|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2016|volume=100|issue=3|page=332|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=119493974&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|access-date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- What's the point of having this relatively small record in an article about a worldwide epidemic? --&gt;

=== Less-affected areas ===
In Japan, 257,363 deaths were attributed to influenza by July 1919, giving an estimated 0.425% mortality rate, much lower than nearly all other Asian countries for which data are available. The Japanese government severely restricted sea travel to and from the home islands when the pandemic struck.

In Australia, nearly 12,000 perished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040917020632/http://www.ballaratgenealogy.org.au/digby/1919flu.htm Anne Grant, History House, Portland. ''Influenza Pandemic 1919. Portland Victoria'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the pandemic, the isolated island of [[Marajó]], in Brazil's Amazon River Delta had not reported an outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Jeffrey, ed. Pandemic influenza: emergency planning and community preparedness. Boca Raton : CRC Press, 2009. P. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Helena]] also reported no deaths.&lt;ref&gt;"Colonial Annual Report", 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aspirin poisoning ===
In a 2009 paper published in the journal ''[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]'', Karen Starko proposed that [[aspirin poisoning]] contributed substantially to the fatalities. She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the post mortem reports still available, and also the timing of the big "death spike" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31 grams of aspirin per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce hyperventilation in 33% of patients, as well as lung edema in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}} Starko also notes that many early deaths showed "wet," sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a "[[perfect storm]]" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}

As an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the [[Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care]]. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time compared to the rate where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} They concluded that "the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}

=== End of the pandemic ===
After the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&amp;nbsp;– almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 people died in the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus; but John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}}

Another theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|"Deadly Second Wave"]], above).

=== Long-term effects ===
A 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that "cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almond|first=Douglas|date=2006-08-01|title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

[[File:1918 flu in Oakland.jpg|thumb|[[American Red Cross]] nurses tend to flu patients in temporary wards set up inside [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] Municipal Auditorium, 1918.]]

Academic [[Andrew Price-Smith]] has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers, and that both [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}

In the United States, Britain and other countries, despite the relatively high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic in 1918–1919, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a "forgotten pandemic".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}

Various theories of why the Spanish flu was "forgotten" include the rapid pace of the pandemic, which killed most of its victims in the United States, for example, within a period of less than nine months, resulting in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: [[typhoid]], [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]], and [[cholera]] all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrissey|1986}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}

In addition, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320–322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}

The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to have a significant impact on the economy.

Regarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the health care industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garrett|2007}}

Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, Robin, [http://hnn.us/article/146655 The Forgotten American Pandemic: Historian Dr. Nancy K. Bristow on the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, sources from the period explicitly linked the Spanish flu to the cultural figure of [[Don Juan]]. The nickname for the flu, the "Naples Soldier", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fernández Shaw]]'s operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canción del olvido''), the protagonist of which is a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis has argued the Spanish flu–Don Juan connection served a cognitive function, allowing Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through a familiar template, namely the Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp= 103–136}}

[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as Dr. Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]

The origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/influenza.html|title=Open Collections Program: Contagion, Spanish Influenza in North America, 1918–191|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.&lt;ref name=influenzareport&gt;Sometimes a virus contains both avian-adapted genes and human-adapted genes. Both the [[H2N2]] and [[H3N2]] pandemic strains contained avian flu virus [[RNA]] segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source (Belshe 2005)." (from [http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/ai.htm Chapter Two: Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner], a free on-line book called ''Influenza Report 2006'')&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taubenberger|Reid|Louren|Wang|2005}}

Others have disagreed,{{sfn|Antonovics|Hood|Baker|2006}} and more recent research has suggested the strain may have originated in a nonhuman, mammalian species.{{sfn|Vana|Westover|2008}} An estimated date for its appearance in mammalian hosts has been put at the period 1882–1913.{{sfn|dos Reis|Hay|Goldstein|2009}} This ancestor virus diverged about 1913–1915 into two [[clade]]s (or biological groups), which gave rise to the classical swine and human [[H1N1]] influenza lineages. The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.

An effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]]. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist [[Johan Hultin]] from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan [[permafrost]] and samples preserved from American soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm Center for Disease Control: Researchers Reconstruct 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus; Effort Designed to Advance Preparedness] Retrieved on 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) reported that monkeys (''[[Macaca fascicularis]]'') infected with the recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a [[cytokine storm]]{{sfn|Kobasa|et al.|2007}}—an overreaction of the [[immune system]]. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/flu-research.htm?POE=NEWISVA USA Today: Research on monkeys finds resurrected 1918 flu killed by turning the body against itself] Retrieved on 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2008, the body of British politician and diplomat [[Mark Sykes|Sir Mark Sykes]] was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern [[H5N1]] bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/7617968.stm BBC News: Body exhumed in fight against flu] Retrieved on 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The coffin was found to be split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining ''in situ'' in the grave during this process.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Four]] documentary. ''In Search of Spanish Flu''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, research by [[Yoshihiro Kawaoka]] of the [[University of Wisconsin]] linked the presence of three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples to the ability of the flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.{{sfn|Fox|2008}}

In June 2010, a team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported the [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine]] provided some cross-protection against the 1918 flu pandemic strain.{{sfn|Fox|2010}}

One of the few things known for certain about the influenza in 1918 and for some years after was that it was, out of the laboratory, exclusively a disease of human beings.{{sfn|Crosby|1976|p=295}}

In 2013, the AIR Worldwide Research and Modeling Group "characterized the historic 1918 pandemic and estimated the effects of a similar pandemic occurring today using the AIR Pandemic Flu Model". In the model, "a modern day "Spanish flu" event would result in additional life insurance losses of between USD 15.3–27.8 billion in the United States alone", with 188,000–337,000 deaths in the United States.{{sfn|Madhav|2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2475">A '''speed record''' is a [[world record]] for [[speed]] by a person, animal, or [[vehicle]]. The function of speed record is to record the speed of moving animate objects such as humans, animals or vehicles.

== Overall speed record ==
Overall speed record is the record for the highest average speed regardless of any criteria, categories or classes that all the more specific records belong to, provided that the route was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/526993-first-person-to-twice-hold-three-simultaneous-overall-ocean-rowing-speed-records|title=First person to twice hold three simultaneous overall ocean rowing speed records on different oceans|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to compare various performances that differ by the type of the craft, vessel or vehicle, the departure and the arrival points (provided that the distances are comparable), number, age and gender of the crew members, departure date, etc. The distance used for calculating the overall speed record is usually the distance in a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/Blue_Riband_Trophy.htm|title=ocean rowing across Atlantic speed record|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of man-powered races, overall speed record doesn't always reflect the best performance.

== General chronology ==
There are two contrasting models for supercontinent evolution through geological time. The first model theorizes that at least two separate supercontinents existed comprising [[Vaalbara]] (from ~3636 to {{nobr|2803 Ma}}) and [[Kenorland]] (from ~2720 to {{nobr|2450 Ma}}). The [[Neoarchean]] supercontinent consisted of Superia and Sclavia. These parts of Neoarchean age broke off at ~2480 and {{nobr|2312 Ma}} and portions of them later collided to form [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] (Northern Europe North America) ({{nobr|~1820 Ma}}). [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] continued to develop during the [[Mesoproterozoic]], primarily by lateral [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of juvenile arcs, and in {{nobr|~1000 Ma}} [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] collided with other land masses, forming [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Between ~825 and {{nobr|750 Ma}} [[Rodinia]] broke apart.&lt;ref name='donnadieu'&gt;Donnadieu, Yannick et al. "A 'Snowball Earth' Climate Triggered by Continental Break-Up Through Changes in Runoff." Nature, 428 (2004): 303–306.&lt;/ref&gt; However, before completely breaking up, some fragments of Rodinia had already come together to form [[Gondwana]] (also known as Gondwanaland) by {{nobr|~608 Ma}}. [[Pangaea]] formed by {{nobr|~336 Ma}} through the collision of [[Gondwana]], Laurasia ([[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]]), and Siberia.

The second model (Kenorland-Arctica) is based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence and proposes that the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from {{nobr|~2.72 Ga}} until break-up during the [[Ediacaran]] Period after {{nobr|~0.573 Ga}}. The [[plate reconstruction|reconstruction]]&lt;ref name='piper1'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "A planetary perspective on Earth evolution: Lid Tectonics before Plate Tectonics." Tectonophysics. 589 (2013): 44–56.&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the observation that palaeomagnetic poles converge to quasi-static positions for long intervals between ~2.72–2.115, 1.35–1.13, and {{nobr|0.75–0.573 Ga}} with only small peripheral modifications to the reconstruction.&lt;ref name='piper2'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "Continental velocity through geological time: the link to magmatism, crustal accretion and episodes of global cooling." Geoscience Frontiers. 4 (2013): 7–36.&lt;/ref&gt; During the intervening periods, the poles conform to a unified apparent polar wander path. Because this model shows that exceptional demands on the paleomagnetic data are satisfied by prolonged quasi-integrity, it must be regarded as superseding the first model proposing multiple diverse continents, although the first phase (Protopangea) essentially incorporates [[Vaalbara]] and [[Kenorland]] of the first model. The explanation for the prolonged duration of the Protopangea-Paleopangea supercontinent appears to be that [[lid tectonics]] (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) prevailed during [[Precambrian]] times. [[Plate tectonics]] as seen on the contemporary Earth became dominant only during the latter part of geological times.&lt;ref name=piper2 /&gt;

The [[Phanerozoic]] supercontinent Pangaea began to break up {{nobr|215 Ma}} and is still doing so today. Because Pangaea is the most recent of Earth's supercontinents, it is the most well known and understood. Contributing to Pangaea's popularity in the classroom is the fact that its reconstruction is almost as simple as fitting the present continents bordering the Atlantic-type oceans like puzzle pieces.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

== Supercontinent cycles ==
A [[supercontinent cycle]] is the break-up of one supercontinent and the development of another, which takes place on a global scale.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Supercontinent cycles are not the same as the [[Wilson cycle]], which is the opening and closing of an individual oceanic basin. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of Pangaea and Rodinia.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

Secular trends such as [[carbonatite]]s, [[granulite]]s, [[eclogite]]s, and [[greenstone belt]] deformation events are all possible indicators of [[Precambrian]] supercontinent cyclicity, although the Protopangea-Paleopangea solution implies that [[Phanerozoic]] style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times. Also there are instances where these secular trends have a weak, uneven or lack of imprint on the supercontinent cycle; secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

==Supercontinents and volcanism==
[[File:FigureSlabAvalanche.jpg|thumb|As the slab is subducted into the mantle, the more dense material will break off and sink to the lower mantle creating a discontinuity elsewhere known as a slab avalanche.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;]]
[[File:FigureSupercontinentBreakup.jpg|thumb|The effects of mantle plumes possibly caused by slab avalanches elsewhere in the lower mantle on the breakup and assembly of supercontinents.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;]]

The causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by [[convection]] processes in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Approximately 660&amp;nbsp;km into the mantle, a discontinuity occurs, affecting the surface crust through processes like [[Mantle plume|plume]]s and "[[superplume]]s". When a slab of subducted crust is denser than the surrounding mantle, it sinks to the discontinuity. Once the slabs build up, they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a "slab avalanche". This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere. The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume.

Besides having compositional effects on the upper mantle by replenishing the [[Incompatible element|large-ion lithophile elements]], volcanism affects plate movement.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; The plates will be moved towards a geoidal low perhaps where the slab avalanche occurred and pushed away from the geoidal high that can be caused by the plumes or superplumes. This causes the continents to push together to form supercontinents and was evidently the process that operated to cause the early continental crust to aggregate into Protopangea.&lt;ref name='piper3'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "Protopangea: palaeomangetic definition of Earth's oldest (Mid-Archaean-Paleoproterozoic) supercontinent." Journal of Geodynamics. 50 (2010): 154–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersal of supercontinents is caused by the accumulation of heat underneath the crust due to the rising of very large [[convection cell]]s or plumes, and a massive heat release resulted in the final break-up of Paleopangea.&lt;ref name='piper4'&gt;Piper, J.D.A., "Paleopangea in Meso-Neoproterozoic times: the paleomagnetic evidence and implications to continental integrity, supercontinent from and Eocambrian break-up." Journal of Geodynamics. 50 (2010): 191–223.&lt;/ref&gt; Accretion occurs over geoidal lows that can be caused by avalanche slabs or the downgoing limbs of convection cells. Evidence of the accretion and dispersion of supercontinents is seen in the geological rock record.

The influence of known volcanic eruptions does not compare to that of [[flood basalt]]s. The timing of flood basalts has corresponded with large-scale continental break-up. However, due to a lack of data on the time required to produce flood basalts, the climatic impact is difficult to quantify. The timing of a single lava flow is also undetermined. These are important factors on how flood basalts influenced [[paleoclimate]].&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinents and plate tectonics==
Global [[paleogeography]] and plate interactions as far back as [[Pangaea]] are relatively well understood today. However, the evidence becomes more sparse further back in geologic history. [[Paleomagnetism|Marine magnetic anomalies]], [[passive margin]] match-ups, geologic interpretation of [[orogenic belt]]s, paleomagnetism, [[paleobiogeography]] of fossils, and distribution of climatically sensitive strata are all methods to obtain evidence for continent locality and indicators of environment throughout time.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

[[Phanerozoic]] (541 Ma to present) and [[Precambrian]] ({{nobr|4.6 Ga}} to {{nobr|541 Ma}}) had primarily [[passive margin]]s and detrital [[zircon]]s (and [[orogenic]] [[granite]]s), whereas the tenure of Pangaea contained few.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Matching edges of continents are where passive margins form. The edges of these continents may rift. At this point, [[seafloor spreading]] becomes the driving force. Passive margins are therefore born during the break-up of supercontinents and die during supercontinent assembly. Pangaea's supercontinent cycle is a good example for the efficiency of using the presence, or lack of, these entities to record the development, tenure, and break-up of supercontinents. There is a sharp decrease in passive margins between 500 and {{nobr|350 Ma}} during the timing of Pangaea's assembly. The tenure of Pangaea is marked by a low number of passive margins during 336 to {{nobr|275 Ma,}} and its break-up is indicated accurately by an increase in passive margins.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

[[Orogenic belt]]s can form during the assembly of continents and supercontinents. The orogenic belts present on continental blocks are classified into three different categories and have implications of interpreting geologic bodies.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Intercratonic orogenic belts are characteristic of ocean basin closure. Clear indicators of intercratonic activity contain [[ophiolite]]s and other oceanic materials that are present in the suture zone. Intracratonic orogenic belts occur as thrust belts and do not contain any oceanic material. However, the absence of ophiolites is not strong evidence for intracratonic belts, because the oceanic material can be squeezed out and eroded away in an intercratonic environment. The third kind of orogenic belt is a confined orogenic belt which is the closure of small basins. The assembly of a supercontinent would have to show intercratonic orogenic belts.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; However, interpretation of orogenic belts can be difficult.

The collision of [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] occurred in the late [[Palaeozoic]]. By this collision, the [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan mountain range]] was created, along the equator.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;  This 6000-km-long mountain range is usually referred to in two parts: the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian mountain range]] of the late [[Carboniferous]] makes up the eastern part, and the western part is called the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], uplifted in the early [[Permian]]. (The existence of a flat elevated plateau like the [[Tibetan Plateau]] is under much debate.) The locality of the Variscan range made it influential to both the northern and southern hemispheres. The elevation of the Appalachians would greatly influence global atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinental climate==
Continents affect the climate of the planet drastically, with supercontinents having a larger, more prevalent influence. Continents modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths and have a higher albedo than the oceans.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Winds are redirected by mountains, and albedo differences cause shifts in onshore winds. Higher elevation in continental interiors produce cooler, drier climate, the phenonmenon of [[continentality]]. This is seen today in [[Eurasia]], and rock record shows evidence of continentality in the middle of Pangaea.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;

===Glacial===

The term glacio-epoch refers to a long episode of glaciation on Earth over millions of years.&lt;ref name='eyles'&gt;Eyles, Nick. "Glacio-epochs and the Supercontinent Cycle after ~3.0 Ga: Tectonic Boundary Conditions for Glaciation." Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 258 (2008): 89–129. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciers have major implications on the climate particularly through [[sea level change]]. Changes in the position and elevation of the continents, the [[paleomagnetism|paleolatitude]] and ocean circulation affect the glacio-epochs. There is an association between the rifting and breakup of continents and supercontinents and glacio-epochs.&lt;ref name=eyles /&gt; According to the first model for Precambrian supercontinents described above the breakup of [[Kenorland]] and [[Rodinia]] were associated with the [[Paleoproterozoic]] and [[Neoproterozoic]] glacio-epochs, respectively. In contrast, the second solution described above shows that these glaciations correlated with periods of low continental velocity and it is concluded that a fall in tectonic and corresponding volcanic activity was responsible for these intervals of global frigidity.&lt;ref name='piper2'/&gt; During the accumulation of supercontinents with times of regional uplift, glacio-epochs seem to be rare with little supporting evidence. However, the lack of evidence does not allow for the conclusion that glacio-epochs are not associated with collisional assembly of supercontinents.&lt;ref name=eyles /&gt; This could just represent a preservation bias.

During the late [[Ordovician]] (~458.4 Ma), the particular configuration of [[Gondwana]] may have allowed for glaciation and high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to occur at the same time.&lt;ref name='crowley'&gt;Crowley, Thomas J., "Climate Change on Tectonic Time Scales". Tectonophysics. 222 (1993): 277–294.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some geologists disagree and think that there was a temperature increase at this time. This increase may have been strongly influenced by the movement of Gondwana across the South Pole, which may have prevented lengthy snow accumulation. Although late Ordovician temperatures at the South Pole may have reached freezing, there were no ice sheets during the early [[Silurian]] {{nobr|(~443.8 Ma)}} through the late [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] {{nobr|(~330.9 Ma).}}&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt; Agreement can be met with the theory that continental snow can occur when the edge of a continent is near the pole. Therefore, Gondwana, although located tangent to the South Pole, may have experienced glaciation along its coast.&lt;ref name=crowley /&gt;

===Precipitation===

Though precipitation rates during monsoonal circulations are difficult to predict, there is evidence for a large orographic barrier within the interior of [[Pangaea]] during the late Paleozoic {{nobr|(~251.902 Ma).}} The possibility of the SW-NE trending [[Variscan orogeny|Appalachian-Hercynian Mountains]] makes the region's monsoonal circulations potentially relatable to present day monsoonal circulations surrounding the [[Tibetan Plateau]], which is known to positively influence the magnitude of monsoonal periods within [[Eurasia]]. It is therefore somewhat expected that lower topography in other regions of the supercontinent during the [[Jurassic]] would negatively influence precipitation variations. The breakup of supercontinents may have affected local precipitation.&lt;ref name="baum"&gt;Baum, Steven K., and Thomas J. Crowely. "Milankovitch Fluctuations on Supercontinents." Geophysical Research Letters. 19 (1992): 793–796. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When any supercontinent breaks up, there will be an increase in precipitation runoff over the surface of the continental land masses, increasing [[Silicate mineral|silicate]] [[weathering]] and the consumption of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=donnadieu /&gt;

===Temperature===

Even though during the [[Archean|Archaean]] solar radiation was reduced by 30 percent and the [[Cambrian]]-[[Precambrian]] boundary by six percent, the Earth has only experienced three ice ages throughout the Precambrian.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt; Erroneous conclusions are more likely to be made when models are limited to one climatic configuration (which is usually present day).&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

Cold winters in continental interiors are due to rate ratios of radiative cooling (greater) and heat transport from continental rims. To raise winter temperatures within continental interiors, the rate of heat transport must increase to become greater than the rate of radiative cooling. Through climate models, alterations in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content and ocean heat transport are not comparatively effective.&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models suggest that values were low in the late [[Cenozoic]] and [[Carboniferous]]-[[Permian]] glaciations. Although early [[Paleozoic]] values are much larger (more than ten percent higher than that of today). This may be due to high seafloor spreading rates after the breakup of Precambrian supercontinents and the lack of land plants as a carbon sink.&lt;ref name=crowley /&gt;

During the late [[Permian]], it is expected that seasonal [[Pangaea]]n temperatures varied drastically. Subtropic summer temperatures were warmer than that of today by as much as 6–10 degrees and mid-latitudes in the winter were less than −30 degrees Celsius. These seasonal changes within the supercontinent were influenced by the large size of Pangaea. And, just like today, coastal regions experienced much less variation.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

During the [[Jurassic]], summer temperatures did not rise above zero degrees Celsius along the northern rim of [[Laurasia]], which was the northernmost part of Pangaea (the southernmost portion of Pangaea was Gondwana). Ice-rafted [[dropstone]]s sourced from Russia are indicators of this northern boundary. The [[Jurassic]] is thought to have been approximately 10 degrees Celsius warmer along 90 degrees East [[paleomagnetism|paleolongitude]] compared to the present temperature of today's central [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

===Milankovitch cycles===

Many studies of the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]] fluctuations during supercontinent time periods have focused on the Mid-[[Cretaceous]].  Present amplitudes of [[Milankovitch cycles]] over present day Eurasia may be mirrored in both the southern and northern hemispheres of the supercontinent Pangaea.  Climate modeling shows that summer fluctuations varied 14–16 degrees Celsius on Pangaea, which is similar or slightly higher than summer temperatures of Eurasia during the [[Pleistocene]]. The largest-amplitude Milankovitch cycles are expected to have been at mid- to high-latitudes during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]].&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

==Proxies==
[[File:FigureUPbZircons.jpg|thumb|U–Pb ages of 5,246 concordant detrital zircons from 40 of Earth's major rivers&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, Ian H., Charlotte M. Allen. "Formation of Supercontinents Linked to Increases in Atmospheric Oxygen." Nature. 1 (2008): 554–558.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Granites]] and detrital [[zircon]]s have notably similar and episodic appearances in the rock record. Their fluctuations correlate with Precambrian supercontinent cycles. The U–Pb [[zircon]] dates from orogenic granites are among the most reliable aging determinants. Some issues exist with relying on granite sourced zircons, such as a lack of evenly globally sourced data and the loss of granite zircons by sedimentary coverage or [[pluton]]ic consumption. Where granite zircons are less adequate, detrital zircons from [[sandstone]]s appear and make up for the gaps. These detrital zircons are taken from the sands of major modern rivers and their drainage basins.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Oceanic magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic data are the primary resources used for reconstructing continent and supercontinent locations back to roughly 150 Ma.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinents and atmospheric gases==
Plate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere (specifically [[greenhouse gas]]es) are the two most prevailing factors present within the [[geologic time scale]]. [[Continental drift]] influences both cold and warm climatic episodes. Atmospheric circulation and climate are strongly influenced by the location and formation of continents and megacontinents. Therefore, continental drift influences mean global temperature.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

Oxygen levels of the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon were negligible and today they are roughly 21 percent. It is thought that the Earth's oxygen content has risen in stages: six or seven steps that are timed very closely to the development of Earth's supercontinents.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt;
# Continents collide
# Supermountains form
# Erosion of supermountains
# Large quantities of minerals and nutrients wash out to open ocean
# Explosion of marine algae life (partly sourced from noted nutrients)
# Mass amounts of oxygen produced during photosynthesis
The process of Earth's increase in atmospheric oxygen content is theorized to have started with continent-continent collision of huge land masses forming supercontinents, and therefore possibly supercontinent mountain ranges (supermountains). These supermountains would have eroded, and the mass amounts of nutrients, including [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]], would have washed into oceans, just as we see happening today. The oceans would then be rich in nutrients essential to photosynthetic organisms, which would then be able to respire mass amounts of oxygen. There is an apparent direct relationship between orogeny and the atmospheric oxygen content). There is also evidence for increased sedimentation concurrent with the timing of these mass oxygenation events, meaning that the organic carbon and [[pyrite]] at these times were more likely to be buried beneath sediment and therefore unable to react with the free oxygen. This sustained the atmospheric oxygen increases.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt;

During this time, {{nobr|2.65 Ga}} there was an increase in [[Isotopes of molybdenum|molybdenum isotope]] fractionation. It was temporary, but supports the increase in atmospheric oxygen because molybdenum isotopes require free oxygen to fractionate. Between 2.45 and {{nobr|2.32 Ga,}} the second period of oxygenation occurred, it has been called the 'great oxygenation event.' There are many pieces of evidence that support the existence of this event, including [[red beds]] appearance {{nobr|2.3 Ga}} (meaning that Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was being produced and became an important component in soils). The third oxygenation stage approximately {{nobr|1.8 Ga}} is indicated by the disappearance of [[iron]] formations. [[Neodymium]] isotopic studies suggest that iron formations are usually from continental sources, meaning that dissolved Fe and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had to be transported during continental erosion. A rise in atmospheric oxygen prevents Fe transport, so the lack of iron formations may have been due to an increase in oxygen. The fourth oxygenation event, roughly {{nobr|0.6 Ga,}} is based on modeled rates of [[Isotopes of sulfur|sulfur isotopes]] from marine carbonate-associated [[sulfate]]s. An increase (near doubled concentration) of sulfur isotopes, which is suggested by these models, would require an increase in oxygen content of the deep oceans. Between 650 and {{nobr|550 Ma}} there were three increases in ocean oxygen levels, this period is the fifth oxygenation stage. One of the reasons indicating this period to be an oxygenation event is the increase in [[redox]]-sensitive molybdenum in black [[shale]]s. The sixth event occurred between 360 and {{nobr|260 Ma}} and was identified by models suggesting shifts in the balance of &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sulfates and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in carbonates, which were strongly influenced by an increase in atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gday-mate-17-billion-year-old-chunk-of-north-america-found-in-australia/ar-AAv5aZn|title=G'day mate: 1.7-billion-year-old chunk of North America found in Australia|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134510/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gday-mate-17-billion-year-old-chunk-of-north-america-found-in-australia/ar-AAv5aZn|archivedate=2018-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etzioni writes that supranationality can be thought of as "a composite of several elements."  These elements can be present alone or all together.  The three elements of supranationality are defined as follows:

#Making of significant decisions by a body that is not made of national representatives and that does not receive instructions from national governments.  (Though such a body is frequently elected by national authorities or their constituents. Frequently such a body is made up of officials acting in an individual capacity.)
#The subjects or participants (national governments or individuals) are legally obligated to comply with the decisions of the body.
#Individuals or other private parties may interact directly with the body and/or have legal obligations as stated above.

{{US tanks}}

==World War I==
[[Image:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|left|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]

As the American army did not have tanks of its own, the French two-man [[Renault FT]] Light Tank was used by US in the later stages of [[World War I]]. It was cheap and well-suited for mass production, and in addition to its traversable turret another innovative feature of the FT was its engine located at the rear. This pattern, with the gun located in a mounted turret and rear engine, became the standard for most succeeding tanks across the world even to this day.

The '''M1917''' was a US tank accepted by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French [[Renault FT]]. The crew, a driver and gunner, were separated from the engine by a bulkhead. Steel idler wheels replaced the wooden idlers fitted to French examples. Approximately 64 of the M1917 were built before the end of World War I and 10 were sent to Europe, but too late to be used in combat. After the war Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Company, and the C.L. Best Tractor Company created 950 more. 374 had cannons and 526 had machine guns and 50 were signal (radio) tanks. A later modification, the M1917A1, was a lengthened, rebuilt, updated version compared to the French one, having a 100&amp;nbsp;hp Franklin engine and an electric self-starter rather than a crank starter.&lt;ref&gt;The Renault FT Light Tank; S. Zaloga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treat 'Em Rough! Capt. Dale E. Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. troops also used the British Heavy Tanks Mk V and Mk V* (pronounced "Mark Five" and "Mark Five Star"). A battalion trained in England and saw action in France in the last six weeks of the War. On a small number of occasions, U.S. troops were supported by tank units of the French Army operating [[Schneider CA1|Schneider]] and [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] machines.

====World War II====
[[Marmon-Herrington CTLS|Marmon-Herrington tanks]] that could not be delivered because of the fall of the Dutch East Indies were taken over by the US. The CTLS-4TAC and -4TAY tanks were redesignated Light Tank T14 and T16 respectively. They were used for training, some were used in Alaska and by the US Marines. The CTLS-4TAC has the turret offset to the left, the CTLS-4TAY to the right.

===M3/5 Stuart===
====World War II====
[[File:M3-Stuart-Fort-Knox-3.jpg|thumb|right|M3 Stuart at Fort Knox, Kentucky, used for training.]]
The [[M3 Stuart|Stuart]] was an upgrade of the [[M2 Light Tank]].

The initial upgrade was designated the M3 Stuart and had thicker [[vehicle armour|armor]], modified suspension and a 37mm&amp;nbsp;mm gun. Production of the M3 and later the M5 Stuart started in March 1941 and continued until October 1943 with a total of 25,000 produced.

An upgrade of the M3, which was initially called M4 but later redesignated the M5, was developed with improved engines and produced through 1942. The M5 featured a redesigned hull and driver's hatches moved to the top. The M5 gradually replaced the M3 in production from 1942 and was in turn succeeded by the [[M24 Chaffee|Light Tank M24]] in 1944.

The [[British Army]] was the first to use the M3 in combat. In November 1941, some 170 Stuarts took part in [[Operation Crusader]], with poor results.

Although the high losses suffered by Stuart-equipped units during the operation had more to do with better tactics and training of the enemy than superiority of enemy tanks in the [[North African campaign]], the operation revealed that the M3 had several technical faults. Mentioned in the British complaints were the 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun, a limited range and poor internal layout. The two-man turret crew was a significant weakness, and some British units tried to fight with three-man turret crews. Crews liked its high speed and mechanical reliability.

From the summer of 1942, when enough US medium tanks had been received, the British usually kept Stuarts out of tank-to-tank combat. M3s, M3A3s, and M5s continued in British service until the end of the war, but British armor units had a smaller proportion of these light tanks than US units.

The other major [[Lend-Lease]] recipient of the M3, the [[Soviet Union]], was even less happy with the tank, considering it undergunned, underarmored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The narrow tracks were highly unsuited to operation in winter conditions, as they resulted in high ground pressures that sunk the tank. However, the Stuart was superior to early-war Soviet light tanks such as the [[T-60]], which were often underpowered and possessed even lighter armament than the Stuart. In 1943, the [[Red Army]] tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design wasn't much better than the M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.

In [[United States Army|US Army]] service, the M3 first saw combat in the Philippines. Two battalions, comprising the Provisional Tank Group fought in the Bataan peninsula campaign. When the American army joined the [[North African Campaign]] in late 1942, Stuart units still formed a large part of its armor strength.

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] the US quickly disbanding most of their light tank [[battalion]]s and subordinating the Stuarts to medium tank battalions performing the traditional cavalry missions of scouting and screening. For the rest of the war, most US tank battalions had three [[company (military unit)|companies]] of [[M4 Sherman]]s and one company of M3s or M5/M5A1s.

In the European theater, Allied light tanks had to be given cavalry and infantry fire support roles since their main cannon armament could not compete with heavier enemy AFVs. However, the Stuart was still effective in combat in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]], as [[List of Japanese armoured fighting vehicles of World War II|Japanese tanks]] were both relatively rare and were generally much weaker than even Allied light tanks. [[Imperial Japanese Army#The Second World War|Japanese infantrymen]] were poorly equipped with [[anti-tank]] weapons and tended to attack tanks using close-assault tactics. In this environment, the Stuart was only moderately more vulnerable than medium tanks. In addition, the poor terrain and roads common to the theatre were unsuitable for the much heavier M4 medium tanks, and so initially, only light armor could be deployed. Heavier M4s were eventually brought to overcome heavily entrenched positions, though the Stuart continued to serve in a combat capacity until the end of the war.

The US liquidated its Stuarts when it got sufficient numbers of [[M24 Chaffee]]s but the tank remained in service until the end of the war and well after. In addition to the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union, who were the primary users, it was also used by [[France]] and [[China]].

===M24 Chaffee===
====World War II====
[[File:M-24 Chaffee Light Tank 01.jpg|thumb|right|M24 Chaffee on display]]
In April 1943 the government started work on the M24 Chaffee, designated '''Light Tank T24''' as a replacement for the [[Stuart tank|M3/M5 Stuart]] after the original replacement, the M7, was rejected in March. Every effort was made to keep the weight of the vehicle under 20 tons. The [[vehicle armour|armor]] was kept light, and a lightweight 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was developed. The design also featured wider tracks and [[torsion bar]] suspension. It had relatively low silhouette and a three-man turret. In mid-October the first pilot vehicle was delivered and production began in 1944 under the designation '''Light Tank M24'''. 4,730 were produced by the time production was stopped in August 1945.

The first thirty-four M24s reached Europe in November 1944 and were issued to the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized) in France. These were then issued to F Company, 2nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion and F Company, 42nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Battalion which each received seventeen M24s. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, these units and their new tanks were rushed to the southern sector; two of the M24s were detached to serve with the 740th Tank [[Battalion]] of the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]].

The M24 started to enter widespread issue in December 1944 but they were slow in reaching the front-line combat units. By the end of the war many armored divisions were still mainly equipped with the M5. Some armored divisions did not receive their first M24s until the war was over.

Reports were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75&amp;nbsp;mm main gun, as a vast improvement over the 37&amp;nbsp;mm. The M24 was still not up to the challenge of fighting tanks, however, the bigger gun at least gave it a chance to defend itself. Its light armor made it vulnerable in tank vs. tank actions.

The M24s contribution to winning the war was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the M5s of the armored divisions.

==Medium tanks==
===M4 Sherman===
[[File:Armoured Ramp Carrier.jpg|thumb|right|Sherman tank using a Churchill 'Ark' armored ramp carrier]]

====World War II====
The U.S. Army designed the M4 as a replacement for the [[M3 Lee|M3 Medium]]. The designated goals were to produce a fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank currently in use by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis nations]]. In April 1941 the U.S. Armored Force Board chose the simplest of five designs. Known as the T6, the design was a modified M3 hull and chassis, carrying a newly designed turret mounting the Lee's main gun. This became the Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/index.html AFV database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototype M4 was completed in September 1941. The T6 became standardized as the M4, and production after modifications began in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/article/ah20050729b Opening Salvo: M4A1 Sherman Tank by Michael J. Canavan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Army had seven main sub-designations for M4 variants during the production period: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4, M4A5, and M4A6. These designations were manufactured concurrently at different locations.

While most Shermans ran on gasoline, the M4A2 and M4A6 had diesel engines: the M4A2 with a pair of [[General Motors|GMC]] 6-71 straight six engines,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, Thomas. ''Standard Catalog of U.S. Military Vehicles'' (Krause Publications, 1993), pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the M4A6 a [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] RD1820 [[Radial engine#Diesel radials|radial]].&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; These, plus the M4A4 which used the [[Chrysler A57 multibank]] engine, were mostly supplied to Allied countries under Lend-Lease.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, pp.190 &amp; 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; "M4" can refer specifically to the initial sub-type with its Continental radial engine, or generically, to the entire family of seven Sherman sub-types, depending on context. Many details of production, shape, strength, and performance improved throughout production without a change to the tank's basic model number; more durable suspension units, safer "wet" (W) ammunition stowage, and stronger armor arrangements, such as the M4 Composite, which had a cast front hull section mated to a welded rear hull. British nomenclature differed from that employed by the U.S.

Early Shermans mounted a [[75 mm Gun (US)|75&amp;nbsp;mm medium-velocity general-purpose gun]]. Although Ordnance began work on the [[T20 Medium Tank|Medium Tank T20]] as a Sherman replacement, ultimately the Army decided to minimize production disruption by incorporating elements of other tank designs into Sherman production. Later M4A1, M4A2, and M4A3 models received the larger T23 turret, with a high-velocity [[76 mm gun M1]], which reduced the number of HE and smoke rounds carried and increased the number of anti-tank rounds. Later, the M4 and M4A3 were factory-produced with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer and a new distinctive [[mantlet]] in the original turret. The first standard-production 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun Sherman was an M4A1, accepted in January 1944, and the first standard-production 105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer Sherman was an M4 accepted in February 1944.

In June–July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ''Jumbo'' Shermans, which had very thick armor, and the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun in a new, heavier T23-style turret, in order to assault fortifications. The M4A3 was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS (horizontal volute spring suspension) suspension with wider tracks to distribute weight, and the smooth ride of the HVSS with its experimental E8 designation led to the nickname ''Easy Eight'' for Shermans so equipped. Both the Americans and the British developed a wide array of special attachments for the Sherman; few saw combat, and most remained experimental. Those which saw action included the bulldozer blade for Sherman [[Combat engineering vehicle|dozer tanks]], [[Duplex Drive]] for "swimming" Sherman tanks, R3 flame thrower for ''Zippo'' [[flame tank]]s, and the [[T34 Calliope|T34 60-tube ''Calliope'' 4.5" rocket launcher]] for the Sherman turret. The British variants (DD's and mine flails) were among "[[Hobart's Funnies]]," named after their commander, [[Percy Hobart]] of the [[79th Armoured Division]]. [[Image:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|right|A M4A3R3 used by the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].]]

The M4 Sherman's basic chassis was used for all the sundry roles of a modern mechanized force: roughly 50,000 Sherman tanks, plus thousands more derivative vehicles under different model numbers. These included M32 and M74 "tow truck"-style [[armoured recovery vehicle|recovery tanks]] with winches, booms, and an 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortar for smoke screens; M34 (from M32B1) and M35 (from M10A1) [[artillery tractor|artillery prime movers]]; [[M7 Priest|M7B1]], [[M12 Gun Motor Carriage|M12]], [[M40 GMC|M40, and M43]] self-propelled artillery; and the [[M10 Wolverine|M10]] and [[M36 Jackson|M36]] tank destroyers.

The M4 Sherman served with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] during World War II. The U.S. also supplied large numbers to the various [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] countries. Shermans were used during the war by British and Commonwealth armies, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]], [[Free France|Free French]] forces, the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Polish Armed Forces in the West#Army|army in exile]], [[China]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]], and [[Brazil]]'s  [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB)|Expeditionary Force]].

The U.S. Marine Corps used the diesel M4A2 and gasoline-powered M4A3 in the Pacific. However, the Chief of the Army's Armored Force, Lt. Gen. [[Jacob L. Devers]], ordered that no diesel-engined Sherman tanks be used by the Army outside the Zone of Interior (the continental U.S.). The U.S. Army used all types for either training or testing within the United States, but intended the M4A2 and M4A4 to be the primary [[Lend-Lease]] exports.

The M4A1 Sherman first saw combat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in October 1942 with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]]. The first U.S. Shermans in battle were M4A1s in [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']] the next month. At this time, Shermans successfully engaged German Panzer IIIs with long barreled 50mm L60 guns, and Panzer IVs with short barreled 75&amp;nbsp;mm L24 guns. Additional M4 and M4A1s replaced M3 Lees in U.S. tank battalions over the course of the North African campaigns. However, by June 1944, most German tanks were up-gunned and 75&amp;nbsp;mm Shermans were outgunned. The M4 and M4A1 were the main types in U.S. units until late 1944, when the Army began replacing them with the preferred M4A3 with its more powerful {{Convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} engine. Some M4s and M4A1s continued in U.S. service for the rest of the war.

The first Sherman to enter combat with the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun (July 1944) was the M4A1, closely followed by the M4A3. By the end of the war, half the U.S. Army Shermans in Europe had the 76&amp;nbsp;mm gun. The first HVSS Sherman to see combat was the M4A3E8(76)W in December 1944. The M4A3E8 (76)W was arguably the best of the US Sherman tanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">'''Transnational organization''' is a term used in scholarly literature. It refers to [[international organization]]s (usually, [[international nongovernmental organization]]s) that "transcend" the idea of a [[nation-state]].

The distinction between an international and a '''transnational organization''' is unclear and has been criticized by some scholars (ex. Colás, 2002).

Transnational relations have been defined as “contacts, coalitions, and interactions across state boundaries that are not controlled by the central foreign policy organs of governments.”  Examples of transnational entities are “multinational business enterprises and revolutionary movements; trade unions and scientific networks; international air transport cartels and communications activities in outer space.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye, Jr.|first=Joseph S.|author2=Robert O. Keohane|title=Transnational Relations and World Politics: An Introduction|journal=International Organization|year=1971|volume=25|issue=3|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/sdrelint/ficheros_materiales/materiales016.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=331|doi=10.1017/s0020818300026187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transnational social movements are “the broad tendencies that often manifest themselves in particular [[International non-governmental organization|International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs)]].”  Examples of transnational social movements include human rights, women’s, peace, labor, green, or student movements manifested in [[Amnesty International]], the [[Peace Brigades International]], the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=Transnational social movements: an assessment|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/cohen.pdf|publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Warwick|accessdate=27 November 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further definition: “An organization is "transnational" rather than "national" if it carries on significant centrally-directed operations in the territory of two or more nation-states. Similarly, an organization will be called "international" rather than "national" only if the control of the organization is explicitly shared among representatives of two or more nationalities. And an organization is "multinational" rather than "national" only if people from two or more nationalities participate significantly in its operation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=336|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Transnational organizations are designed to facilitate the pursuit of a single interest within many national units.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|title=Transnational Organizations in World Politics|journal=World Politics|year=1973|volume=25|issue=3|jstor=2010115|page=338|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope''' was a worldwide benefit held for the [[tsunami]] victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. It was broadcast on [[NBC]] and its affiliated networks of [[USA Networks|USA Network]],  [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], [[PAX Network|PAX]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNBC]], [[Sci-Fi (United States)|Sci-Fi]], [[Trio (TV network)|Trio]], [[Telemundo]] and other [[NBC Universal]] stations and was heard on any [[Clear Channel]] radio station. The benefit was led by the actor [[George Clooney]] on January 15, 2005, and was similar to ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' (set up after the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]]).  Digital Media innovator [[Jay Samit]] enabled viewers to purchase digital downloads of the performances as a new way to raise money for the cause; including live recordings by [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Roger Waters]].  Taking a cue from [[Bob Geldof]] (the man who had organized the [[Live Aid]] concerts for African famine relief), it consisted of famous Hollywood entertainers and former American presidents [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]].  It was two hours long with stories and entertainment from a huge array of Hollywood popstars notables that include [[Brad Pitt]], [[Donald Trump]], and much more.  It was estimated to raise at least five million dollars by the end of the broadcast.

The '''Tube Challenge''' is the competition for the fastest time to travel to all [[London Underground]] stations, tracked as a [[Guinness World Record]] since 1960. The goal is to visit all the stations on the system, not necessarily all the lines; participants may connect between stations on foot, or by using other forms of public transport.

{{As of|2016}}, the record for fastest completion was held by Andi James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK), who completed the challenge in 15 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds on 21 May 2015.&lt;ref name=alwakeel-20160106&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alwakeel|first1=Ramzy|title=Tube challenger reclaims world record for trip around all 270 stations|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/tube-challenger-claws-back-world-record-for-fastest-journey-around-all-270-stations-a3149961.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=Evening Standard|date=6 January 2016|quote=270 Tube stops in 15 hours and 45 minutes … Mr Wilson … and Mr James’s new record has taken eight months for Guinness World Records to ratify – the pair actually completed their run in May last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations|title=Fastest time to travel to all London Underground stations|quote=15 hr 45 min 38 sec, and was achieved by Andy James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK) in London, UK, on 21 May 2015.|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=11 March 2016|archivedate=4 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083335/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded challenge took place in 1959. Although many people have attempted the challenge and held the record since, they have not always been credited in the record books. In the earlier days of the challenge, participants were permitted to use private forms of transport (such as a car or bike) to move between stations. This led to times of less than 16 hours in some earlier records, and Guinness later changed the rules{{when|date=July 2011}} to ban private transport.

The following is a list of record holders that have appeared in the printed edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. The record did not appear in the book until its eighth edition.

Between the 1960s and 1990s the record regularly appeared in the ''Guinness Book of Records'', initially listed under "Underground Railways – circuit of", but later just under "Railways" and then "Trains".  Since the change of publishing style of the book from the 2001 edition onwards, the record – although frequently broken – has only once appeared in printed form, in the 2008 edition. More recent records have tended to be published online instead. Since the record has not regularly been published in the book, there have been two broad configurations on the system – one for 275 stations, and one for 270 once the East London Line was no longer part of the network.

===275 stations===
On 3 April 2002 Jack Welsby set a new record time for 275 stations by traversing the system in 19 hours, 18 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|title=New record set on the tube|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=24 July 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141751/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|archivedate=5 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsby made just one attempt, starting his route at Heathrow and finishing at Amersham.

This time was beaten on 4 May 2004 by [[Geoff Marshall]] and Neil Blake who achieved a new record time of 18 hours 35 minutes and 43 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/every-tube-station-in-18-hours-7235423.html|title=Every Tube station in 18 hours|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempt began on the first train out of [[Amersham station|Amersham]] on the Metropolitan Line and ended at [[Upminster station|Upminster]], and it took Guinness World Records four months to ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3700658.stm|title=Tube station visit record broken|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2004 | date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous attempt had been broadcast on TV as part of ''[[The Tube (2003 TV series)|The Tube]]'' TV series and another attempt had been televised as part of an ITV1 programme ''Metroland: Race Around the Underground'' on 16 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|title=Going down the tubes|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=17 October 2003|accessdate=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429143148/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|archivedate=29 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this time stood for two years before being beaten by just five seconds, it was not until Håkan Wolgé and Lars Andersson (both from Sweden) set a new record time for 275 stations that it appeared in the ''Guinness World Records'' Book again, in the 2008 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2008"/&gt; They set a new record of 18 hours, 25 minutes and 3 seconds, on 26 September 2006.

===270 stations===
Changes to the total number of stations meant that the record was 'reset' and broken three more times over a two-year period until Wood Lane station opened in October 2008, and the network settled at 270 stations.

The first holders of the 270-station record were Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who, on 14 December 2009, achieved a record time of 16 hours, 44 minutes and 16 seconds.&lt;ref name=Southwest&gt;{{Cite news|title = Richard's going underground on charity mission|quote = ''[will] attempt to dethrone Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who set the benchmark on December 14, 2009.''|publisher = This Is Plymouth|date = 4 February 2010|url = http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|accessdate = 12 July 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040236/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|archivedate = 14 June 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TfL used this route four years later as part of the Art on the Underground [[labyrinth]] project to mark the 150th anniversary of the [[London Underground]], installing permanent designs at stations in the same order that the world record route had taken, and later appeared in an ''Information Capital'' article.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Telegraph|title=How to do the Tube Challenge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11174269/How-to-do-the-Tube-Challenge.html|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record remained unbeaten for 17 months, until Marc Gawley from Denton, Greater Manchester, set a new time of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 57 seconds on 21 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|title=New world record for Denton man who travelled to all 270 London tube stations in under 17 hours|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1425496_new-world-record-for-denton-man-who-travelled-to-all-270-london-tube-stations-in-under-17-hours|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fast marathon runner, he revealed that he did not use any buses on the day, preferring instead to make all his connections on foot. Gawley's record was beaten 37 days later, when James and Wilson completed the challenge in just 44 seconds under Gawley's time, setting a new record of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 13 seconds on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2013"/&gt;

This record stood for over two years until August 2013, before being broken by previous record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] who along with Anthony Smith, completed the challenge in 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds,&lt;ref name="bbc2013"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=London Tube Station Visiting Record Broken|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24203949|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Londonist|title=New world record for Tube Challenges|url=http://londonist.com/2013/09/new-world-record-for-tube-challenge.php|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the record time was then published for the first time in seven years in the ''Guinness World Records'' in the 2015 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2015"/&gt;

Clive Burgess and Ronan McDonald set a new Guinness world record time of 16 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Brighton Argus|title=For the record, world was enthusiats's Oyster card|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12901532.For_the_record__world_was_enthusiast___s_Oyster__card_/|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken later that year, on 21 May, by previous record holders Andi James and Steve Wilson, in a time of 15 hours 45 minutes 38 seconds.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"/&gt;

==Other attempts==

Attempts to travel the network have been linked to charities such as Children in Need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wear/hi/front_page/newsid_9184000/9184337.stm|title=Pudsey Challenge 2010|publisher=BBC Sunderland|date = 12 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/going_underground_1_2769466|title=Going Underground|newspaper=Sunderland Echo|date = 26 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesthegill.blogspot.com/2009/03/red-nose-day-tube-challenge-2009.html|title=Aiming to misbehave|date = 14 March 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charity attempt known as "Tube Relief" was organised, following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], to raise money for the [[London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund]]. Fifty-one people rode the entire tube network for the day,&lt;ref name="Tube challenge for bomb charity"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4180368.stm |title=Tube challenge for bomb charity|publisher=BBC News |date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising over £10,000 towards the official charity fund. A [[Sue Ryder (charity)|Sue Ryder]] charity event took place in November 2011, when ten teams competed against each other to have their photo taken outside as many of the 270 stations as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day/|title=Visiting 270 London Underground stations in one day|publisher=Purple Frog|date=14 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424125549/http://www.purplefrog.co.uk/2011/11/visiting-270-london-underground-stations-in-1-day|archivedate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] subsequently organised a mass-participant event in 2014, called "Walk The Tube", which has become an annual event, raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geofftech.co.uk/tube/tube26.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1OF9dSMD4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''WTA Rankings''' are the [[Sports rating system|ratings]] defined by the [[Women's Tennis Association]], introduced in November 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/rankings |title=WTA Rankings |publisher=Women's Tennis Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking method==
The WTA rankings are based on a rolling 52-week, cumulative system. A player's ranking is determined by her results at a maximum of 16 tournaments for singles and 11 for doubles  and points are awarded based on how far a player advances in a tournament. The basis for calculating a player's ranking are those tournaments that yield the highest ranking points during the rolling 52-week period with the condition that they must include points from the 4 Grand Slams, the 4 Premier Mandatory tournaments and the WTA Finals. In addition, for Top 20 players, their best two results at Premier 5 tournaments will also count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTA – All About Rankings|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/all-about-rankings#|publisher=WTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2016, the WTA also distributed ranking points, for singles players only, who competed at the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanjing.itftennis.com/olympics/players/ranking-points.aspx|accessdate=16 September 2014|title=Ranking Points|publisher=itftennis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has since been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The points distribution for tournaments in 2017 is shown below. [[2013 WTA Tour#Points distribution|Points earned in 2013]] were a little different in some cases and retained their value until they expired after 52 weeks.

'''Willis Clark Conover, Jr.''' (December 18, 1920 – May 17, 1996) was a [[jazz]] producer and broadcaster on the [[Voice of America]] for over forty years. He produced jazz concerts at the [[White House]], the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], and for movies and television. By arranging concerts where people of all races were welcome, he is credited with desegregating Washington D.C. nightclubs.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Robert McG. Thomas Jr., [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/us/willis-conover-is-dead-at-75-aimed-jazz-at-the-soviet-bloc.html?pagewanted=1 "Willis Conover Is Dead at 75; Aimed Jazz at the Soviet Bloc"], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 19, 1996. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover is credited with keeping interest in jazz alive in the countries of Eastern Europe through his nightly broadcasts during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Ripmaster 2007" /&gt;

== Youth ==
As a young man Conover was interested in science fiction, and published a [[science fiction fanzine]], ''Science Fantasy Correspondent''. This brought him into contact with [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The correspondence between Lovecraft, who was at the end of his life, and the young Conover, has been published as ''Lovecraft at Last'' (Carrolton-Clark, 1975; reprint 2004).

Conover's father had intended for him to attend [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] and follow his family's tradition of military service. Instead, he attended the [[Salisbury University|Maryland State Teacher's College]] at [[Salisbury, Maryland]], and became a radio announcer for [[WTBO]] in [[Cumberland, Maryland]].

He later moved to Washington, D.C., and focused on jazz in his programming, especially the [[Duke Ellington]] hour on Saturday nights.  His guests on this program and Saturday morning shows included many important artists, such as [[Boyd Raeburn]].

== Voice of America ==

[[File:Conover.poland 1.jpg|left|thumb|Conover's first arrival in Poland (1959)]]
Conover came to work at the [[Voice of America]], and eventually became a legend among jazz lovers, primarily due to the hour-long program on the Voice of America called ''[[Voice of America Jazz Hour]]''. Known for his sonorous [[baritone]] voice, many would argue that he was the most important presenter on Voice of America. His slow delivery and the use of scripts written in "special English" made his programmes more widely accessible and he is said to have become the first teacher of English to a whole generation of East European jazz lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], ''Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2006, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Conover was not well known in the United States, even among jazz aficionados, as the Voice of America did not broadcast domestically except on [[shortwave]], but his visits to Eastern Europe and [[Soviet Union]] brought huge crowds and star treatment for him.
He was a celebrity figure in the Soviet Union, where jazz was very popular and the Voice of America was a prime source of information as well as music.

In 1956, Conover conducted a series of interviews with jazz luminaries like [[Duke Ellington]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Stan Kenton]], [[Benny Goodman]], and [[Art Tatum]].  His interview with Tatum is noted as "the only known in-depth recorded interview with the pianist".  These interviews were selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as a 2010 addition to the [[National Recording Registry]], which selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2010reg.html | title=The National Recording Registry 2010 | accessdate=April 10, 2011 | publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

He died of lung cancer. He had been a smoker for 57 years.&lt;ref name=CER&gt;James Lester, [http://www.ce-review.org/99/5/music5_lester.html "Willis of Oz"], ''[[Central Europe Review]]'', Vol. 1, No. 5, July 26, 1999. Retrieved February 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1990, Conover was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/conover-willis-clark-jr&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[University of North Texas]] announced its Willis Conover Collection would make digitized copies of Conover's programs available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Doug | last=Ramsey | title=The Willis Conover Archive Is Online | series=Rifftides | website=ArtsJournal | url=http://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2015/09/the-willis-conover-archive-is-online.html | accessdate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41055">The '''World Archery Rankings''' is a ranking system developed by the [[World Archery Federation]] for [[Modern competitive archery|international competitive archery]]. It is calculated using a points system and published following major [[World Archery Federation|World Archery]] tournaments.

The ranking system was first developed in 2001, and calculation method updated in 2010. At present, rankings are maintained for:
* '''[[Recurve bow|Recurve archery]]''': ''Men's Individual, Women's Individual, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team''
* '''[[Compound bow|Compound archery]]''': ''Men's Individual, Women's Individual, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team''
* '''Para-archery''': ''Recurve Men W2, Recurve Men Standing, Compound Men W1, Compound Men Open, Recurve Women W2, Recurve Women Standing, Compound Women Open, Visually Impaired Open''
* '''Nations''': ''National rankings based on all disciplines''

From 2006, rankings were calculated for [[Field Archery]], but since 2012 are no longer maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archeryranking.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=652&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==

Each archer or team earns a ranking score for each competition. The ranking scores are calculated through a combination of the ranking factor of the tournament ("Ranking Factor") and points based on the competitor's final position in the competition ("Ranking Score"). The archer's four highest ranking scores are then combined to form their total score ("Added Ranking Score"), which forms the basis of the ranking list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Results/World%20Ranking/WorldRanking_CalculationSystem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228065232/http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Results/World%20Ranking/WorldRanking_CalculationSystem.pdf |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranking Factor===
Only results achieved at official ranking events can count towards the overall rankings. These events include the major [[World Archery Federation]] tournaments ([[Archery at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]], [[World Archery Championships]], [[FITA Archery World Cup|World Cup]]), and other international, regional and national events that have applied and been approved for ranking status.

The tournament ranking factor is calculated on the basis of three sub-factors, Quality, Quantity and Period, which are multiplied together to produce the overall tournament factor. The factor can vary between disciplines at the same event (e.g., the recurve and compound disciplines at the World Championships may have different Ranking Factors).

For instance, the Ranking Factor of a tournament for individuals with 60 archers, of whom 10 are in the top 50, that took place 18 months ago, would be:

'''2.5''' ''("Quality": 9-12 top 50 archers)'' x

'''0.9''' ''("Quantity": 33-64 archers)'' x

'''0.5''' ''("Period": other tournament 12-24 months ago)'' =

'''''1.125'''''

====Quality====
The Quality sub-factor takes into account the level of competition at the tournament. A score is assigned based on the prestige of the event, for the major [[World Archery Federation]] tournaments, and the number of top archers or teams at other competitions (defined as individuals ranked in the top 50 or teams ranked in the top 16). The quality factor points are assigned as follows:

====Period====
The Period sub-factor is dependent on when the competition took place, allowing the Ranking Factor to emphasise the most recent tournaments as follows:

{| cellspacing="1" style="border:1px solid #aaa; font-size:90%;"
|- style="background:#e4e4e4;"
!  style="border-bottom:1px solid #aaa; width:250px;"|Tournament

!  style="border-bottom:1px solid #aaa; width:100px;"|Points
|- 
| rowspan=3 valign="top" | [[Archery at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] || Up to 12 months after the tournament || 1
|-
| 12–24 months after the tournament || 0.8
|-
| More than 24 months after the tournament || 0
|-  
| rowspan=3 valign="top" | [[World Archery Championships]] || Up to 12 months after the tournament || 1
|-
| After 12 months until the next tournament || 0.8
|-
| After the next tournament || 0
|- 
| rowspan=3 valign="top" | Continental Championships || Up to 12 months after the tournament || 1
|-
| After 12 months until the next tournament || 0.8
|-
| After the next tournament || 0
|- 
| rowspan=3 valign="top" | Other tournaments || Up to 12 months after the tournament || 1
|-
| 12–24 months after the tournament || 0.5
|-
| More than 24 months after the tournament || 0
|}

===Ranking Points===

Ranking Points are awarded based on the team or competitor's final position at the competition. This is then multiplied by the Ranking Factor to produce the overall Ranking Score for that team or competitor at that tournament. For instance, an archer who finished 4th in the competition used in the example above would receive the following Ranking Score:

'''1.125''' ''("Ranking Factor")'' x

'''12''' ''("Ranking Points": 4th place)'' =

'''''13.5'''''

A team or competitor's best four Ranking Scores are then combined to produce the Added Ranking Score, which forms the basis of the  rankings list. No more than two Ranking Scores whose period factor is lower than 1 may be used to calculate the Added Ranking Score.

Ranking Points are awarded as follows:

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

===World Environment Day Anthem===
An Earth Anthem penned by poet [[Abhay K]] is sung to celebrate World Environment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.lk/online/2015/05/30/world-environment-day.html World Environment Day] The Nation, Sri Lanka,  30 May 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Our cosmic oasis, cosmic blue pearl
the most beautiful planet in the universe
all the continents and the oceans 
united we stand as flora and fauna
united we stand as species of one earth
different cultures, beliefs and ways
we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all
united we unfurl the blue flag.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The '''World Health Imaging, Telemedicine and Informatics Alliance''' (WHITIA) is a non-profit [[global health]] technology and [[social venture]] established in 2006 by affiliates of [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="McCByDesign"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://magazine.mccormick.northwestern.edu/FA2007/Xray.html | title = McCormick students and faculty tackle health care challenge in the developing world  | publisher= Robert R.

WHITIA's vision is to facilitate the deployment of thousands of digital medical imaging systems worldwide, providing one billion people with access to diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealthimaging.org/ |title=Welcome to WHITIA &amp;#124; Homepage |publisher=Worldhealthimaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was formerly known as the World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) until it formally expanded its scope in June 2009.

WHITIA's first formal public launch was in April 2009 at the [[HIMSS|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. WHITIA announced strategic partners including [[SEDECAL]], [[Carestream Health]] and [[Merge Healthcare]], receiving extensive coverage in [[Health IT]] magazines and publications.&lt;ref name="HIMSS09"&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS111037+06-Apr-2009+BW20090406 | title = Not-for-Profit Has a Vision to Help a Billion People | publisher= Reuters | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoofinance1"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Merge-Healthcare-Commits-1-bw-14855801.html?x=1&amp;.v=1 | title = World Health Imaging Alliance Poised to Bring Imaging Diagnostics and Data to the Developing World | publisher= Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Annual  Conference of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], WHITIA announced its partnership with [[Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine|SIIM]], which will allow both organizations to collaborate on specific initiatives.&lt;ref name="SIIM09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090605005136/en | title = World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) Announces Support From The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IE09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.imagingeconomics.com/news/2009-06-17_01.asp | title = World Health Imaging Alliance poised to bring imaging diagnostics and data to the developing world | publisher= Imaging Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was recently ranked #15 of the top 25 most influential people, institutions, and organizations in the radiology industry.&lt;ref name="rt-image"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | url = http://www.rt-image.com/25_Most_Influential_in_Radiology_Recognizing_the_movers_and_shakers_in_the_radio/content=9004J05E48B6A084409698724488B0441 | title = 25 Most Influential in Radiology | publisher= rt Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 [[Radiological Society of North America|RSNA]] Annual Meeting, WHITIA launched, '''Remi-d''', a remote-operated screening X-ray system for use in the developing world. Its strengths in these areas stem from the higher burden of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infection, high incidences of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung disease]], or outbreaks of other infectious [[respiratory diseases]]. The teleradiology and remote-controlled features of Remi-d allow resource-limited areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia, where [[Radiologist]]s and [[Radiographer]]s are in short supply to have a functioning X-ray service.&lt;ref name="RSNA09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20091130/WHITIA-launches-digital-medical-X-ray-device-for-screening-infectious-diseases-in-developing-countries.aspx | title = WHITIA launches digital medical X-ray device for screening infectious diseases in developing countries | publisher= THE MEDICAL NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHITIA currently has [[Pilot (experiment)|pilot]] [[System integration|integrated]] [[digital X-ray]] sites in [[South Africa]] and [[Guatemala]] at established [[clinics]] in need and is expanding to new qualified sites in [[partnership]] with [[NGOs]] such as [[Rotary International]] while cooperating with the [[local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]].&lt;ref name="HTW09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.healthtechwire.com/The-Industry-s-News-unb.146+M5a262949a06.0.html | title = SIIM to Support World Health Imaging Alliance | publisher= HealthTech Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guatemala clinics ==
The Guatemala pilot sites in urban [[Guatemala City]] and [[rural]] [[Río Hondo, Zacapa|Río Hondo]] provide essential healthcare technology to thousands of people in the communities served. They are designed to be models for the wider expansion of the WHITIA network throughout the clinics in need in urban and rural Guatemala. The system's specific design for Guatemala City is an integration of some of WHITIA's partners' strengths and generosity:

* [[SEDECAL]] provides the X-ray generator and controls
* [[Carestream Health]] donates the [[Photostimulated luminescence|computed radiography]] (CR) digital scanner and plates
* [[Kane X-ray]] donates personnel to perform installation and set up of the CR and [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]

This project was largely funded by several US and Guatemalan [[Rotary International|Rotary clubs]] along with the key resource support of the Guatemalan municipal and national governments.&lt;ref name="GUATE11"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110104006502/en/WHITIA-Announces-Completion-Digital-X-ray-Pilot-Sites | title = WHITIA Announces the Completion of Digital X-ray Pilot Sites in Urban and Rural Guatemala | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Heritage Logo global.svg|thumb|[[Logo]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Committee]]]]

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]). It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

===Cultural criteria===
[[File:Taj Mahal 2012.jpg|thumb|Site#252: [[Taj Mahal]], an example of a cultural heritage site.|alt=Site#252: The Taj Mahal, an example of a world heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"represents a masterpiece of human creative genius and cultural significance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"exhibits an important interchange of human values, over a span of time, or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning, or landscape design"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"to bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilization which is living or which has disappeared"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural, or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example of a traditional  human settlement, land-use, or sea-use which is representative of a culture, or human interaction with the environment especially when it has become vulnerable under the impact of irreversible change"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO World Heritage, The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Natural criteria===
[[File:Zerbras drinking.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#156: [[Serengeti National Park]], an example of a natural heritage site.]]
[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Site#274: [[Machu Picchu|Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu]], an example of a mixed heritage site.]]
&lt;ol type="i" start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing major stages of Earth's history, including the record of life, significant on-going geological processes in the development of landforms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"is an outstanding example representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems, and communities of plants and animals"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"contains the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Legal status of designated sites===
UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The properties "[[Uvs Nuur Basin]]" and "[[Transbaikal|Landscapes of Dauria]]" ([[Mongolia]], [[Russian Federation]]) are trans-regional properties located in Europe and Asia and the Pacific region. They are counted here in the Asia and the Pacific region.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The property "[[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]]" ([[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]]) is a trans-regional property with component sites located in three regions - Europe and North America, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It is counted here in Europe and North America.

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Trade Report''' (WTR) is the annual report published since 2003 by the [[World Trade Organization]]. Each WTR provides an in-depth analysis of an aspect of trends in [[international trade]], [[trade policy]] issues and the multilateral trading system.

==2016 Report==
The [https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/wtr16_e.htm 2016 World Trade Report] examines the participation of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in international trade, how the international trade landscape is changing for SMEs, and what the multilateral trading system does and can do to encourage more widespread and inclusive SME participation in [[global markets]].

the map represents state-of-the art knowledge of the time, actively collected from Portuguese sources by the makers of the [[Dieppe maps]] during the 1540s to 1560s. The presentation of ''[[Terra Australis]]'' is conventional, imagined as attaching to the [[Strait of Magellan]]. A possible sighting of Australia prior to 1560 has been discussed in scholarship but is mostly considered unlikely. The interior of Africa was at the time largely unexplored and is filled in with partially fictional geography.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''world map''' is a [[map]] of most or all of the surface of the [[Earth]]. World maps form a distinctive category of maps due to the problem of [[Map projection|projection]]. Maps by necessity distort the presentation of the earth's surface. These distortions reach extremes in a world map. The many ways of projecting the earth reflect diverse technical and aesthetic goals for world maps.&lt;ref name="ACA1988"&gt;
{{cite book

| author = American Cartographic Association's Committee on Map Projections
| year = 1988
| location = Falls Church
| publisher = American Congress on Surveying and Mapping
| pages = 1–2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World maps are also distinct for the global knowledge required to construct them. A meaningful map of the world could not be constructed before the European [[Renaissance]] because less than half of the earth's coastlines, let alone its interior regions, were known to any culture. New knowledge of the Earth's surface has been accumulating ever since and continues to this day.

Maps of the world generally focus either on political features or on physical features. Political maps emphasize territorial boundaries and human settlement. Physical maps show [[geography|geographic]] features such as [[mountains]], [[soil type]] or [[land use]]. [[Geological map]]s show not only the surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[Geologic fault|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures. [[Choropleth map]]s use color hue and intensity to contrast differences between regions, such as demographic or economic statistics.

==Map projections==
{{Cleanup gallery|date=October 2018}}
{{further|Map projection}}
{{see also|List of map projections}}

A map is made using a map projection, which is any method of representing a [[globe]] on a plane. All projections distort distances and directions, and each projection distributes those distortions differently. Perhaps the most well known projection is the [[Mercator Projection]], originally designed as a [[nautical chart]].

==Historical maps==
{{Cleanup gallery|date=October 2018}}
{{Further|Early world maps}}
[[Early world maps]] cover depictions of the [[world]] from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Age of Discovery]] and the emergence of modern [[geography]] during the [[early modern period]]. Old maps provide much information about what was known in times past, as well as the philosophy and cultural basis of the map, which were often much different from modern cartography. Maps are one means by which scientists distribute their ideas and pass them on to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/map/h_map/h_map.htm|title=History of maps and cartography|work=emporia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references.

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Five billion===
'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

Demographers do not universally accept this date as being exact.  In fact there has been subsequent research which places the day of six billion nearer to 18 June or 19 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~galen/popclk.html |title=Population Clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Programs division of the United States Census Bureau estimated that the world population reached six billion on 21 April 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  United Nations Population Fund spokesman Omar Gharzeddine disputed the date of the Day of Six Billion by stating, "The U.N. marked the '6 billionth' [person] in 1999, and then a couple of years later the Population Division itself reassessed its calculations and said, actually, no, it was in 1998."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News |url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/28/8525681-7-billion-people-how-do-they-know |title=Cosmic Log – 7 billion people?

National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s. Commentators in countries with high [[immigration]] have pointed out that a population milestone may be reached by an immigrant rather than [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/australias-population-reaches-24-million/7170274|title=Australia's population hits 24 million people, ABS clock shows|date=2016-02-16|work=[[ABC Online]] |quote=The ABS said it was unclear whether the 24 millionth Australian was a newborn or a migrant|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/baby-reed-is-one-in-23-million-almost/story-fngr8hax-1226627384262|title=Baby Reed is one in 23 million as Australia's population hits a milestone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location= Sydney, Australia |quote=He said the 23rd millionth person could be a newborn but could equally be a person coming to work in Australia or a returning backpacker who had been away for more than a year.|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
