[[File:40 Window world map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|The nations in the 10/40 Window]]
The '''10/40 Window''' is a term coined by [[mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] strategist and Partners International CEO [[Luis Bush]] in 1990&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/ |title=The 10/40 Window |work=Time |date=June 30, 2003| accessdate= March 1, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234833/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/| archivedate= April 28, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}.

At the time, the authoritative source for socioeconomic and political metrics for every nation. Extreme poverty was denoted as under US$500 per capita GNP (in 1990 dollars).

What is least controversial is those areas with least access throughout history, as all metrics for such areas are zero or close to zero. Examples of metrics used include the presence of (Christian) work and workers (of any kind, whether community development, health, business, child care, house servants, etc), media in an appropriate language (print, TV, radio, web, etc.),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ow&gt;[[Operation World]] provides a concise well-researched/cited data summary for each nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wce&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=David B.|author2=Kurian, George T.|author3=Johnson, Todd M.

The concept behind the ''10/40 Window'' highlights these three elements (as of data available in 1990): an area of the world with great poverty and low quality of life, combined with lack of access to Christian resources. The Window forms a band encompassing [[Sahara]]n and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[animist]], [[Jewish]], or [[atheist]]. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

==Origin==
This region of the world was previously known to Christians as the "resistant belt", as noted by [[Luis Bush]] at the 1989 [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne II Conference in Manila]]. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based [[GIS]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas GIS, produced by Strategic Mapping Inc., was the first PC Geographic Information System.{{cite news|url=http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php |title=ESRI Retires ArcCAD and Atlas GIS| accessdate= September 21, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070925180632/http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php| archivedate= September 25, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the ''10/40 box''. A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the ''10/40 Window'', stating that this region ought to be seen as a "window of opportunity".{{citation needed |date= September 2007}} The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase ''10/40 Window region''.

Before being called the "resistant belt", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the "unoccupied fields" by [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer|Samuel Zwemer]], in his book by that same title, published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwemer|first=Samuel M. |title=The Unoccupied Mission Fields of Africa and Asia|location=New York|publisher=Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions|page=260|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Verbal and online discussions, no documentation available outside of Wikipedia itself.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.

The 1990 research data states:
* this part of the world was home to the largest populations living in deep poverty and lowest [[quality of life]];&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mappoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mapqual/&gt;
* this part of the world did have least access to Christian resources. Note the emphasis on ''access'' not ''percent Christian''. The West has ubiquitous access to such resources; this area of the world did and does not.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

This research deals in overall population characteristics. The ''10/40 Window'' is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:
* The 10/40 Window article refers to the "poorest of the poor" living in that region (based on late-1980s per-capita [[GNP]] under US$500).&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Of the three billion people living in such poverty-stricken nations, 82% lived in the 10/40 Window. Yet the 10/40 Window also includes nations such as [[South Korea]] and Japan. In the late 20th century, Japan boasted the world's third largest economy, and South Korea the eleventh. Such nations were strong throughout the late 20th century.
* Geographically, the 10/40 Window includes the [[Philippines]] and [[Portugal]], which both have a Roman Catholic Christian majority; [[Greece]], where almost 98% of the population belonged to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]; and South Korea, which is home to the largest single congregation church in the world&lt;ref&gt;The largest congregation is in Seoul ([[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]) {{cite news |url=http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html |title=The Top 10 Churches in the World (by size)| accessdate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162953/http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html| archivedate= September 27, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the second largest missionary-sending nation in the world.&lt;ref name=misinc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html |title=Missions Incredible|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107083606/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html|archivedate=November 7, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10/40 Window does not encompass [[Indonesia]] or Sri Lanka, nations that had very little access to Christian resources.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

==Gaining widespread use==
Over the years, the 10/40 Window has evolved from a specialist term used by Christian [[Missiology|missiologists]] to assumed vocabulary for Christians in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=792 |title=Becoming Global Christians in the 21st Century By Justin Long – Charisma Magazine, (2001) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=1575 |title=Islam and China's Christmas By David Aikman – Charisma Magazine, (2002) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tcw/2003/001/11.12.html |title=Marli Spieker &amp;#124; Today's Christian Woman &amp;#124; Your Life.

==Analysis==
The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):
*82% of the poorest of the world's poor (per capita GNP less than US$500 per year),&lt;ref name=mappoor&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poorest Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy),&lt;ref name=mapqual&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Quality of Life &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.,)&lt;ref name=maprel&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Three Religious Blocks &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mapislam&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Islam &amp;  &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*close to 100% of those who were both most-poor ''and'' had least-access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)&lt;ref name=mapprun&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poor, The Unevangelized, &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The least Christian resource investment&lt;ref&gt;Well below 10 percent in any of the study populations. Each of the cited maps provides side data on population, Christian involvement, etc in the various study populations (poor, low quality of life, non-Christian, etc)&lt;/ref&gt; and least sharing of the Christian message&lt;ref name=mapleast&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The 55 Least Evangelized Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; almanac, the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref name=wce/&gt; and the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

===Non-Christians in the 10/40 Window by religion===
The first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:
* 28 Muslim countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 2 Hindu countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 8 Buddhist countries, 237 million population est. (2000)

[http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/1040.htm Later updates] have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of "[[unreached]]" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:
*865 million Muslims
*550 million Hindus
*275 million Buddhists
*140 million in 2550 tribal groups (mainly animist)
*17 million Jews&lt;ref&gt;Note that this number is higher than the census-based world total of 14 million. However, even authoritative [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html Jewish sources] state that many Jews do not identify themselves in population censuses.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nations in the 10/40 Window===
The 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the [[Joshua Project]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/resources/articles/10_40_window |title=What is the 10/40 Window? |publisher=joshuaproject.net |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amrit Velā''' ({{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਵੇਲਾ}}) (Time of [[Amrita|Amrit]]) refers to the early morning period of time sometime between 3:00am and 6:00am&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W.

[[Guru Nanak]] in the [[Japji Sahib]] (4th Pauri) says, "In amrit velā meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."&lt;ref name="McLeod" /&gt; The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

In the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine ''Naam'' (through [[Simran]] and [[Nam Japo|Naam Japna]]).

'''{{IAST|Anekāntavāda}}''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:अनेकान्तवाद|अनेकान्तवाद]]}}, "many-sidedness") refers to the [[Jainism|Jain]] doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient [[India]].{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=325-326, 342}} It states that the ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | editor =Tara Sethia | title =Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =2004 | location =Delhi | pages =123–136 | isbn =81-208-2036-3 | chapter =Beyond Anekāntavāda : A Jain approach to religious tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anekantavada has also been interpreted to mean non-absolutism, "intellectual Ahimsa",{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=324}} [[religious pluralism]],{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=36}} as well as a rejection of fanaticism that leads to terror attacks and mass violence.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor=Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=85–88 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that modern revisionism has attempted to reinterpret anekantavada with religious tolerance, openmindedness and pluralism.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-334}}

According to [[Jainism]], no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. This knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]''), it adds, is comprehended only by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi |page=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge claims, according to the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.

The origins of ''anekāntavāda '' can be traced back to the teachings of [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] (599–527 [[BCE]]), the 24th Jain {{IAST|''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankara]]''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3}} The [[dialectic]]al concepts of ''syādvāda'' "conditioned viewpoints" and ''nayavāda'' "partial viewpoints" arose from ''anekāntavāda'' in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-2}}

==Etymology==
The word ''anekāntavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words: ''anekānta'' and ''vāda''. The word ''anekānta'' itself is composed of three root words, "an" (not), "eka" (one) and "anta" (end, side), together it connotes "not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness", or "manifoldness".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name= "grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vāda'' means "doctrine, way, speak, thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), "वाद", Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, pages 939-940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBSn4dR087YC |year=1982|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''anekāntavāda'' is translated by scholars as the doctrine of "many-sidedness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F. Gier|title=Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b0uIvu4aBuMC |year= 2000|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0-7914-4528-0|pages=80, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O9JlrJ1wwAC |year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9131-9|pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; "non-onesidedness",{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=1}} or "many pointedness".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

The term ''anekāntavāda'' is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

==Philosophical overview==
The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', also known as ''anekāntatva'', states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''naya'', or "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} Language  is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it still remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}

The ''anekāntavāda'' premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''Nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}}

The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', according to Bimal Matilal, states that "no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=2}} For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (''syadvada'') or limitations (''nayavada'', standpoints).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3, 30-32, 52-54}}

===Syādvāda===

''Syādvāda'' ({{lang-sa|स्याद्वाद}}) is the theory of ''conditioned predication'', the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word ''syāt'' ({{lang-sa|स्यात्}}), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb ''as'' ({{lang-sa|अस्}}), 'to be', and which becomes ''syād'' when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with ''sandhi''. The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc.  It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc.  The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'.  The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.

Syat can be translated into English as meaning "perchance, may be, perhaps" (it is).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}  The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense.  For example, sutra 1.4.96 of [[Pāṇini|Panini]]'s Astadhyayi explains it as signifying "a chance, maybe, probable".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}

In Jainism, however, ''syadvada'' and ''anekanta'' is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is "conditional yes or conditional approval" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase ''syad etat'',  meaning "let it be so, but", or "an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise".  This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of ''syad etat''.  Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=93–95 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context ''syadvada'' does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means "multiplicity or multiple possibilities".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} ''Syat'' in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a "many sidedness" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;

''Syādvāda'' is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=90–92 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or "[[Jaina seven-valued logic|the theory of sevenfold scheme]]".&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; These ''saptibhaṅgī'' seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=230}} and they are:&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "grimes"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=29}}

Each of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt; The phrase ''syāt'' declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]''), place (''kṣetra''), time (''kāla''), and being (''bhāva''), and negation with regard to other substance (''dravya''), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (''bhāva''). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (''dravya'') – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (''kṣetra'') – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}} In regard to time (''kāla'') – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (''bhāva'') – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}}

According to [[Acharya Samantabhadra|Samantabhadra]]'s text ''Āptamīmāṁsā'' (Verse 105), "''Syādvāda'', the doctrine of conditional predications, and ''kevalajñāna'' (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while ''kevalajñāna'' illumines directly, ''syādvāda'' illumines indirectly".{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 163}} ''Syadvada'' is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 174}}

===Nayavāda===

''Nayavāda'' ({{lang-sa|नयवाद}}) is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation") and ''vāda'' ("doctrine, thesis").&lt;ref name="Grimes202"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 198, 202–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt; Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}

According to Jainism, there are seven ''nayas'' or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using ''syadvada''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}} These seven ''naya'', according to [[Umaswati]], are:{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 119, 198–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt;
#Naigama-naya: common sense or a universal view
#Samgraha-naya: generic or class view that classifies it
#Vyavahara-naya: pragmatic or a particular view assesses its utility
#Rijusutra-naya: linear view considers it in present time
#Sabda-naya: verbal view that names it
#Samabhirudha-naya: etymological view uses the name and establishes it nature
#Evambhuta-naya: actuality view considers its concrete particulars

The ''naya'' theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of ''nayavada'' concept in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}}

A particular viewpoint is called a ''naya'' or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, ''Nayavada'' does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A ''naya'' reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (''syādvāda'').{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=28}}

===Jiva, the changing soul===
[[File:Mahavra 1900 art.jpg|thumb|Mahāvīra did not use the word ''anekāntavada'', but his teachings contain the seeds of the concept (painting from [[Rajasthan]], ca. 1900)]]
Ancient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'' (self, matter) utilizes ''anekantavada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Benesch|title=An Introduction to Comparative Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEWDAAAQBAJ |year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-59738-9|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H.

The [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of ''[[Brahman]]'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of [[anatta]] (no-self).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with ''anekāntavāda''.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}; Quote: "To counter the proponents of these diametrically opposed positions [Buddhist and Hindu], Jains developed a position knows as syadvada [seeud-VAH-duh], the way or path of "perhaps, maybe or somehow." Syadvada states simply that judgments resting on different points of view may differ without any of them being wholly wrong. [...] A limited and incomplete judgment is called a naya [nuh-yuh], and all human knowledge is a compilation of nayas, judgments resulting from different attitudes. The Jains were thus able to accept equally the Hindu views of "being" and Buddhist views of "becoming," but took neither in the sense that their partisan advocates desired or found comforting. [...] The Jain doctrine of syadvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that Jainism is the right religious path."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvind" &gt;[[Arvind Sharma|Sharma, Arvind]] (2001) Preface xii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as ''ekantika'' or only partially true.&lt;ref&gt;Sethia, Tara (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;Burch, George (1964) pp. 68–93&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through ''anekānta'' has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as [[Arvind Sharma]], who wrote:&lt;ref name="Arvind"/&gt;
{{Quote|Our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially, but not philosophically. This paradox is the paradox of change. Something – A changes and therefore it cannot be permanent. On the other hand, if A is not permanent, then what changes? In this debate between the "permanence" and "change", Hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and Buddhism the second. It is Jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously, and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either.}}

===Inclusivist or exclusivist===
Some Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in "exclusivist term as the one true path".&lt;ref name=sethia123/&gt; Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be "heterodox and heretics" and that they "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]]".&lt;ref name=sethia123&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be "approved or accommodated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Koller states ''anekāntavāda'' to be "epistemological respect for view of others" about the nature of existence whether it is "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but "not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".&lt;ref name="koller89"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps, just one perspective".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

==History and development==
The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' is one of the foundational [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept. The development of ''anekāntavāda'' also encouraged the development of the dialectics of ''syādvāda'' (conditioned viewpoints) and ''nayavāda'' (partial viewpoints).

According to Karl Potter, the Jain ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt; The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that "unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with [[Anatta]] (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (''jiva'') and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.&lt;ref name=johnson232/&gt;&lt;ref name=potter114&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0779-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The origins of ''anekāntavāda'' are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.&lt;ref name="bhagvati"&gt;Charitrapragya, Samani (2004) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Early Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-62}} According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial ''anekantavada'' doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}} These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}}

The early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. ''Śvētāmbara'' text, ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'' contains references to ''Vibhagyavāda'', which, according to [[Hermann Jacobi]], is the same as ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī''.&lt;ref name="sutra"&gt;Jacobi, Hermann (1895) 14:21–22&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted ''vibhagyavada'' as ''syadvada'', the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text ''[[Sutrakritanga]]''.&lt;ref name="jacobi327"/&gt; However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jaina-canon Jaina canon], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
A monk should be modest, though he be of a fearless mind; he should expound the ''syādvāda'', he should use the two permitted kinds of speech, living among virtuous men, impartial and wise.

According to Upadhyaye, the ''Bhagvatisūtra'' (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the ''saptibhaṅgīnaya''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye"&gt;Upadhyaye, A. N. (2001) pp. 6136–37&lt;/ref&gt; This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina/&gt;

The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Slaje| title=Śāstrārambha: Inquiries Into the Preamble in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C| year=2008| publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn=978-3-447-05645-8|page=35 with footnote 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digambara scholar [[Kundakunda]], in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī'' in ''Pravacanasāra'' and  ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pancastikayasāra]]''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye" /&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} Kundakunda also used ''nayas'' to discuss the essence of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] in ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]''. Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on ''anekantavada'' to the late 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=107-109}}

===Parable of the blind men and elephant===
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|Seven blind men and an elephant parable]]
The Jain texts explain the ''anekāntvāda'' concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E.

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

This parable is called ''Andha-gaja-nyaya'' maxim in Jain texts.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=40–43 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Jain references to this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century).&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt;

While the [[Blind men and an elephant|same parable]] is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D.

*from a certain point of view, or in a certain sense, the pot exists
*from a certain point of view, the pot does not exist
*from a certain point of view, the pot exists and does not exist
*from a certain point of view, the pot is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot both exists and is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot both does not exist and is inexpressible
*from a certain point of view, the pot exists, does not exist, and is also inexpressible

===Medieval developments===

Ācārya [[Haribhadra]] (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of ''anekāntavāda''. He wrote a [[doxography]], a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work ''Purusathasiddhiupaya'' with strong praise for ''anekāntavāda'': "I bow down to the principle of ''anekānta'', the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity."&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. P. (2006) Verse no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in ''Tattvarthaslokavārtikka'', 116:&lt;ref&gt;T. W. Rhys Davids (1980) pp. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|[[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]]}}, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond ''anekāntavāda'' by advocating ''madhāyastha'', meaning "standing in the middle" or "equidistance". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. C. (2001) p. 1487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient [[Indian philosophy]], in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref name = "McEvilley-p335"&gt;McEvilley, Thomas (2002) p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemology of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.

While employing ''anekāntavāda'', the 17th century Jain scholar [[Yasovijaya]] stated that it is not ''anābhigrahika'' (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In Jain belief, ''anekāntavāda'' transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Wright  | first =J.

''Anekāntavāda'' played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from [[Saiva|Śaiva]]s, [[Vaishnava|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslim]]s, and [[Christian]]s at various times. According to John Koller, professor of [[Asian studies]], ''anekāntavāda'' allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of [[Haribhadra]] justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=335-336, 338-339}}

There is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of "benevolence and tolerance" towards others.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=340-341}}

===Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi===
Mahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal ''[[Young India]] – 21 Jan 1926''. According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the "reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of [[Brahman]]", and his view of "Hindu religious pluralism":{{sfn|Long|2013|p=169}}&lt;ref name = "hay"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hay | first =Stephen N. | editor = Sibnarayan Ray | title =Gandhi India and the World | publisher =Nachiketa Publishers | year =1970 | location =Bombay | pages =14–23 | chapter =Jain Influences on Gandhi's Early Thought }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhi Juhu May1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] used the Jain concept of Anekantavada to explain his views.&lt;ref name="ShermaSharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.D.

{{Quote|I am an [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitist]] and yet I can support [[Dvaita|Dvaitism]] (dualism). The world is changing every moment, and is therefore unreal, it has no permanent existence. But though it is constantly changing, it has a something about it which persists and it is therefore to that extent real. I have therefore no objection to calling it real and unreal, and thus being called an ''Anekāntavadi'' or a ''Syādvadi''. But my ''Syādvāda'' is not the ''Syādvāda'' of the learned, it is peculiarly my own. I cannot engage in a debate with them. It has been my experience that I am always true from my point of view, and am often wrong from the point of view of my honest critics. I know that we are both right from our respective points of view. And this knowledge saves me from attributing motives to my opponents or critics. (...) My ''Anekāntavāda'' is the result of the twin doctrine of [[Satyagraha]] and {{IAST|''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]]''}}.}}

===Against religious intolerance and contemporary terrorism===
Referring to the [[September 11 attacks]], John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that ''anekāntavāda'' is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.&lt;ref name="Johnkoller"&gt;Koller, John (2004) pp. 85–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Scott R.|date=2014-07-03|title=Anekāntavāda and Engaged Rhetorical Pluralism: Explicating Jaina Views on Perspectivism, Violence, and Rhetoric | journal= Advances in the History of Rhetoric |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15362426.2014.933721 | volume=17|issue =2|pages=131–156|doi= 10.1080/15362426.2014.933721| issn= 1536-2426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|James William Jones|2008}}

According to Sabine Scholz, the application of the ''Anekantavada'' as a religious basis for "intellectual Ahimsa" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that ''Anekantavada'' is an expression of "religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against "intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism".&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Scholz|editor=Julia A. B. Hegewald and Subrata K. Mitra|title=Re-Use-The Art and Politics of Integration and Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZqHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0981-5|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as [[John E. Cort]] and [[Paul Dundas]] state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as "religious tolerance of other opinions" is a "misreading of the original doctrine". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}}&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt; John Cort states that the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or "intellectual Ahimsa". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present "Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-331}} According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of "accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=333-334}}

According to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" in self-defense would not lose any merit.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}} N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and ''Anekantavada'' doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.L. Jain|editor=Colette Caillat and Nalini Balbir|title=Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecKCrO6nLiAC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3247-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;

==Comparison with non-Jain doctrines==
According to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that "Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (''anekāntika'') truth" while for Buddhism this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagchandra Jain; ''The Rudiments Of Anekāntavāda In Early Pali Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, states Jayatilleke, "no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions."&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are ''anekamsika'' (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the [[Four Noble Truths]], while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the [[The unanswered questions|avyakata-theses]].&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"/&gt; Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as ''satkaryavada'', ''asatkaryavada'', ''avirodhavada'' and others.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gaudapadiya-Karika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0904-7|pages=194–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anekantavada'' overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is ''satkaryavada'' in explaining causes, and the ''asatkaryavada'' in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=133, see Causal Models}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] further elaborated and refined the theory of ''[[pramana]]s'' and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Julius Lipner]]|title=The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Ramanuja|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjR2xuu4L8EC |year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-038-0|pages=82–89, 133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Indologists]] such as professor [[John E. Cort]] state that ''anekāntavāda'' is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}} According to [[Paul Dundas]], in Jain hands, this method of analysis became "a fearsome weapon of philosophical [[polemic]] with which the doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be".&lt;ref Name="Dundas192"&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of ''Anekantavada'' self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.&lt;ref Name="Dundas192" /&gt;

The doctrines of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādavāda'' are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is ''anekāntavāda'' true or false?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Webb | first =Mark Owen | title =The Jain Philosophy | work =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm#H4 | accessdate = 2008-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302171025/http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pandya, V. (2001) p. 5210&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just "compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

===Hindu philosophies===
====Nyaya====
The [[Nyaya]] school criticized the Jain doctrine of ''anekantavada'', states Karl Potter, as "wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, "jiva and ajiva are not related" and "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that ''jiva'' attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of ''anekantavada'' makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year= 1991|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn= 978-81-208-0779-2|pages=145–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaisheshika====
The [[Vaisheshika]] and [[Shaivism]] school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for [[moksha]] meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under ''Anekantavada'' doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

====Vedanta====
''Anekāntavāda'' was analyzed and critiqued by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Śankarācārya]] (~800 CE) in his ''bhasya'' on ''[[Brahmasutra]]'' (2:2:33–36):&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1992) pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that ''anekantavada'' doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: ''virodha'' (contradictions) and ''samsaya'' (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

{{Quote|
It is impossible that contradictory attributes such as being and non-being should at the same time belong to one and the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment. The third alternative expressed in the words — they either are such or not such — results in cognition of indefinite nature, which is no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is. Thus the means of knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act of knowledge become all alike indefinite. How can his followers act on a doctrine, the matter of which is altogether indeterminate? The result of your efforts is perfect knowledge and is not perfect knowledge. Observation shows that, only when a course of action is known to have a definite result, people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be listened any more than a drunken or a mad man.
|Adi Shankara, ''Brahmasutra'', 2.2:33–36}}

Shankara's criticism of ''anekantavada'' extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The problem with ''anekantavada'' doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be "certain that everything is uncertain". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

Contemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of ''Anekantavada'' does reject some versions of the "law of non-contradiction", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=42–43 with footnotes 15 and 16}}, '''Quote:''' "This is the sense in which it is correct to say that the Jainas reject the "law of non-contradiction".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
The Buddhist scholar [[Shantarakshita|Śāntarakṣita]], and his student Kamalasila, criticized ''anekantavada'' by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise "jivas (souls) do not exist". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=57}} According to Santaraksita, Jains state that "jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively", but if so debates Santaraksita, "jiva cannot change". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to "jiva don't exist".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the "fallacy of division".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

The Buddhist logician [[Dharmakirti]] critiqued ''anekāntavāda'' as follows:{{sfn|Pandya|2001}}
{{Quote|With the differentiation removed, all things have dual nature. Then, if somebody is implored to eat curd, then why he does not eat camel?" The insinuation is obvious; if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from the nature of a camel, then one is justified in eating camel, as by eating camel, he is merely eating the negation of curd.|Dharmakirti, ''Pramānavarttikakārika''}}

===Self-criticism in Jain scholarship===
The medieval era Jain logicians [[Akalanka]] and [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyananda]], who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his ''Pramanasamgraha'' acknowledges seven problems when ''anekantavada'' is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (''vaiyadhi karanya''), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}} Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of ''vyatikara'' (cross breeding in ideas) and ''apratipatti'' (incomprehensibility). [[Prabhācandra]], who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in ''anekantavada'' application.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

Other [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] cultures have traditionally had similar spiritual mediators, although [[Alaskan Native religion]] has many forms and variants.

==Role in Inuit society==
Both women and men could become an angakkuq,&lt;ref name="Freuchen 1960"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freuchen|first1=Dagmar|title=Peter Freuchen's Adventures in the Arctic|date=1960|publisher=Messner|location=New York|page=136||accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although it was rarer for women to do so. The process for becoming an angakkuq varied widely. The son of a current angakkuq might be trained by his father to become one as well. Alternatively, a young man or woman who exhibited a predilection or power that made them stand out might be trained by an experienced mentor. There are also instances of angakkuit claiming to have been called to the role through dreams or visions.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; Mistreated orphans or people who had survived hard times might also become angakkuit with the help of the spirits of their dead loved ones.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt; 

Training to become an angakkuq consisted of acculturation to the rites and roles necessary for the position, as well as instruction in the special language of the angakkuit,&lt;ref name="Freuchen 1960b"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freuchen|first1=Dagmar|title=Peter Freuchen's Adventures in the Arctic|date=1960|publisher=Messner|location=New York|page=132||accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which consisted largely of an archaic vocabulary and oral tradition that was shared across much of the Arctic areas the Inuit occupied. During their training, the angakkuq would also gain a familiar or spirit guide who would be visible only to them.&lt;ref name=bastian&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Bastian, Dawn E.  |author2=Mitchell, Judy K. | title = Handbook of Native American Mythology | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2004 | location = Santa Barbara, California | pages = 47–49 | isbn = 1-85109-533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guide, called a [[Inuit religion|tuurngaq]], would at times give them extraordinary powers. Inuit stories tell of agakkuit who could run as fast as [[caribou]], or who could fly, with the assistance of their tuurngaq. In some traditions, the angakkuq would be either stabbed or shot, receiving no wound because of the intervention of their tuurngaw, thus proving their power.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt;

Until spiritual guidance or assistance was needed, an angakkuq lived a normal life for an Inuit, participating in society as a normal person. But when sickness needed to be cured, or divination of the causes of various misfortunes was needed, the angakkuq would be called on.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; The services of an angakkuit might also be required to interpret dreams.&lt;ref name="orale"/&gt; If they were called to perform actions that helped the entire village, the work was usually done freely. But if they were called to help an individual or family, they would usually receive remuneration for their efforts.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt; 

Amongst the Inuit, there are notions comparable to laws:
* ''tirigusuusiit'', things to avoid
* ''maligait'', things to follow
* ''piqujait'', things to do
If these three are not obeyed, then the angakkuq may need to intervene with the offending party in order to avoid harmful consequence to the person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradition-orale.ca/english/tirigusuusiit-and-maligait-58.html |title=  
Tirigusuusiit and Maligait |accessdate=2007-10-17 |work=tradition-orale.ca| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071114230224/http://www.tradition-orale.ca/english/tirigusuusiit-and-maligait-58.html| archivedate= 14 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking these laws or taboos was seen as the cause of misfortune, such as bad weather, accidents, or unsuccessful hunts. In order to pinpoint the cause of such misfortune, the angakkuq would undertake a spirit-guided journey outside of their body. They would discover the cause of the misfortune on this journey. Once they returned from the journey, the angakkuq would question people involved in the situation, and, under the belief that they already knew who was responsible, the people being questioned would often confess. This confession alone could be declared the solution to the problem, or acts of penance such as cleaning the urine pots or swapping wives might be necessary.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt;

The angakkuit of the central Inuit participate in an annual ceremony to appease the mythological figure [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], the Sea Woman. The Inuit believed that Sedna became angry when her taboos were broken, and the only way to appease her was for an angakkuq to travel in spirit to the underworld where she lived, [[Adlivun]], and smooth out her hair. According to myth, this was of great assistance to Sedna because she lacks fingers. The angakkuq would then beg or fight with Sedna to ensure that his people would not starve, and the Inuit believed that his pleading and apologies on behalf of his people would allow the animals to return and hunters to be successful. After returning from this spirit journey, communities in which the rite was practiced would have communal confessions, and then celebration.&lt;ref name="bastian"/&gt;

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

[[Image:Catrina-sculpture.jpg|right|thumb|A ''calaca'' of [[La Calavera Catrina]].]]
A '''calaca''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈlaka}}, a colloquial [[Mexican Spanish]] name for [[skeleton]]) is a figure of a [[human skull|skull]] or [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] (usually human) commonly used for decoration during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Day of the Dead]] festival, although they are made all year round.

==Description==
Tracing their origins from [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] imagery, calacas are frequently shown with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flowers and foliage. As with other aspects of the Day of the Dead festival, calacas are generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful figures. They are often shown wearing festive clothing, dancing, and playing musical instruments to indicate a happy afterlife. This draws on the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly, and that death should be a joyous occasion. This goes back to Aztec beliefs, one of the few traditions to remain after the Spanish conquest.

Calacas used in the festival include carved skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made out of carved wood or fired clay, and sweet treats in the form of [[human skull|skull]]s or skeletons. Calacas are sometimes made of wood, stone, or even candy.

A popular phrase among Mexicans and those Latinos that personally know someone is "se lo (la) llevó la calaca" after someone has died, literally meaning "the calaca took him (her)" or "death took him (her)".

In Guatemala, "calaca" is understood as "death". The figure of a bare skeleton represents death and implies fear of death.  Thus, it is not normally utilized as a joyful image.

==Popular culture==
Calaca-like figures can be seen in the [[Tim Burton]] films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', Neil Gaiman's movie ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', the PlayStation 3 games ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) and ''[[Guacamelee!]]'' (2013), and the 1998 [[Tim Schafer]] computer game ''[[Grim Fandango]].''

Calacas are prominently featured as representations of the deceased in ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]''.

In ''[[Monster High]]'', Skelita Calaveras is a calaca and is the daughter of Los Esklitos (The Skeletons).

In ''[[El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera]]'', the villain Sartana of the Dead is a calaca and commands various calacas that are in her service.

The Calacas are featured in ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]''.

The "'''conflict thesis'''" is a [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] which maintains that there is an intrinsic intellectual conflict between [[religion]] and [[science]] and that the [[relationship between religion and science]] inevitably leads to hostility; examples to support this thesis have commonly been drawn from the relations between science and religion in Western Europe.

== The historical conflict thesis ==
[[File:John William Draper.jpg|right|thumb|John William Draper]]
[[File:Andrew Dickson White 1885.jpg|right|thumb|Andrew Dickson White]]
In the 1800s the relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional interactions were expressed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=9780674057418|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was around the mid-1800s that discussion of "science and religion" first emerged because before this time, "science" still included moral and metaphysical dimensions, was not inherently linked to the [[scientific method]], and the term "scientist" did not emerge until 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|isbn=022618448X|chapter=6. Professing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist [[John William Draper]] and the writer [[Andrew Dickson White]] were the most influential exponents of the conflict thesis between religion and science. Draper had been the speaker in the [[British Association]] [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|meeting of 1860]] which led to the famous confrontation between Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] over [[Darwinism]], and in America "the religious controversy over biological evolution reached its most critical stages in the late 1870s".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Post-Darwinian Controversies|first= James R. |last= Moore|page= 10|publisher=|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ppXB4mBY05AC}} quoting Schlesinger. But see also James C. Ungureanu, "A Yankee at Oxford: John William Draper at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford, 30 June 1860," ''Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science '' (Dec 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1870s Draper was invited by American science popularizer Edward Livingston Youmans to write a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), a book replying to contemporary issues in Roman Catholicism, such as the [[papal infallibility|doctrine of papal infallibility]], and mostly criticizing what he claimed to be [[anti-intellectualism]] in [[Roman Catholicism|the Catholic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D (2001), ''Rebuilding the Matrix'', Lion Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7459-5116-3}} (pg. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; but also making criticisms of [[Islam]] and of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;
"Averroes, in his old age - he died A. D. 1193 - was expelled from Spain; the religious party had triumphed over the philosophical. He was denounced as a traitor to religion.  An opposition to philosophy had been organized all over the Mussulman world. There was hardly a philosopher who was not punished." (p142) "The two rival divisions of the Christian Church - Protestant and Catholic - were thus in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered to be agreeable to the Scriptures." (p218)
&lt;/ref&gt; Draper's preface summarises the conflict thesis:

{{quotation|The history of Science is not a mere record of  isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, ''History of the Conflict Religion'', D. Appleton and Co. (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1874 White published his thesis in [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 8/February 1876/The Warfare of Science I|Popular Science Monthly]] and in book form as ''The Warfare of Science'':

{{quotation|In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science—and invariably. And, on the other hand, all untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to religion some of its stages may have seemed, for the time, to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and of science.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Warfare of Science|first= Andrew Dickson|last= White|year= 1876|page= 8|url= https://archive.org/details/warfareofscience00whituoft}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1896, White published ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'', the culmination of over thirty years of research and publication on the subject, criticizing what he saw as restrictive, dogmatic forms of [[Christianity]]. In the introduction, White emphasized that he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting [[Ezra Cornell]] in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation.

[[James Joseph Walsh]], M.D., the historian of medicine, criticized White's perspective as anti-historical in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22760194&amp;id=B-cQAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22popes+and+science%22 ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time''] (1908),&lt;ref&gt;Fordam University Press, 1908, Kessinger Publishing, reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-3646-9}}  Reviews: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=02tZKPD5CJrIa31EgK&amp;id=G57Y1rlQVP0C&amp;pg=PT2&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=%22the+popes+and+science%22] [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1407075]&lt;/ref&gt; a book dedicated to [[Pope Pius X]]:

{{quotation|the story of the supposed opposition of the Church and the Popes and the ecclesiastical authorities to science in any of its branches, is founded entirely on mistaken notions. Most of it is quite imaginary. Much of it is due to the exaggeration of the significance of the [[Galileo affair|Galileo incident]]. Only those who know nothing  about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. White's book, contradicted as it is so directly by all serious histories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teachers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and emphasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James Joseph, ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'', Fordam University Press, New York 1908, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''God and Nature'' (1986), [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] report that "White's ''Warfare'' apparently did not sell as briskly as Draper's ''Conflict'', but in the end it proved more influential, partly, it seems, because Draper's strident anti-Catholicism soon dated his work and because White's impressive documentation gave the appearance of sound scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers, ''God &amp; Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'', University of California Press (April 29, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, historians' acceptance of the conflict thesis declined until rejected in the 1970s. David B. Wilson notes:

In his course on science and religion, historian Lawrence Principe summarizes Draper's and White's works by saying, "While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coursebook, Principe writes, "No serious historians of science or of the science-religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable."
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}


Regarding the scholarship of Draper's work, Principe says
{{quotation|How does he [John William Draper] support his contention of conflict?  Well, unfortunately, with some of the worst historical writing you are ever likely to come across.  Historical facts are confected, causes and chronologies twisted to the author’s purpose.  We find interpretations made merely by declaration.  We find quotations violently taken out of context.  And instances, quite a few of them where Draper claims a historical writer said something in fact 180 degrees away from what he actually claimed...Much of Draper’s book is so ridiculous, so malodramatic, so rabid, it’s hard for a knowledgeable person actually to read it without a wry smirk...Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.
&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Academic===

Historians of science today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (those involving Galileo and Darwin) in favor of a "complexity" model, because religious figures took positions on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved in discrediting religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Richard H.|title= For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science|year= 2011|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 9780761855668|pages= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said: "White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science. And both develop and use the same myths to support their narrative, the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|flat-earth legend]] prominently among them".&lt;ref name=Gould1996&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary of the [[historiography]] of the conflict thesis, [[Colin A. Russell]], the former President of [[Christians in Science]], said that "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Colin A., "The Conflict of Science and Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion'', p. 15, New York 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Religion'', Gary Ferngren proposes a complex relationship between religion and science:

{{quotation|While some historians had always regarded the Draper-White thesis as oversimplifying and distorting a complex relationship, in the late twentieth century it underwent a more systematic reevaluation.  The result is the growing recognition among historians of science that the relationship of religion and science has been much more positive than is sometimes thought.  Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization.  If [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] and the [[Scopes trial]] come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor).

Some modern historians of science (such as Peter Barker, [[Bernard R. Goldstein]], and Crosbie Smith) propose that scientific discoveries - such as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] in the 17th century, and the reformulation of physics in terms of [[energy]], in the 19th century - were driven by religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Peter, and Goldstein, Bernard R.

''The Science of Energy: A Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain''.  London: The Athlone PRess, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious organizations and clerics figure prominently in the broad histories of science, until the [[profession]]alization of the scientific enterprise, in the 19th century, led to tensions between scholars taking religious and secular approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the chapters on "Geology and Paleontology" (by Nicolaas A. Rupke), "Natural History" (by Peter M. Hess), and "Charles Darwin" (by James Moore) in Gary Ferngren (ed.), ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the prominent examples of religion's apparent conflict with science, the [[Galileo affair]] (1614) and the [[Scopes trial]] (1925), were not pure instances of conflict between science and religion, but included personal and political facts in the development of each conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Richard J., "Galileo Galilei", ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''; Larson, Edward J.

{{main|Galileo affair}}
The Galileo affair is one of the few examples commonly used by advocates of the conflict thesis. Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of "the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion," and that this view promotes "the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion." Finocchiaro writes, "I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic," and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo "saw" the earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was "imprisoned," since he was "actually held under house arrest."&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included scientific, philosophical, and theological arguments.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt;

The Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed Heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named ''Simplicio'' who was a simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in [[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|''The Sleepwalkers'']] [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This angered the Pope and weakened Galileo's position politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Lindberg|first = David|title = Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]]. Galileo's ''Dialogue'' was banned, the publication of his past or future works forbidden, he was ordered to "abjure, curse and detest" heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–293).&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230419/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 |date=September 27, 2007 }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234122/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 |date=September 27, 2007 }}{{it icon}}.

===Scientist and public perceptions===

This thesis is still held to be true in whole or in part by some prominent contemporary scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]] who has said "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HEUSSNER|first1=KI MAE|title=Stephen Hawking on Religion: 'Science Will Win'|website=ABC News|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Steven Weinberg]], grant that it is possible for science and religion to be compatible since some prominent scientists are also religious, but he sees some significant tensions that potentially weaken religious beliefs overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Lake Views: This World and the Universe|date=2011|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674062302|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done on scientists from 21 American universities showed that most did not perceive conflict between science and religion. In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm. Additionally, scientists were more likely to reject conflict thesis if their peers held positive views of religion.&lt;ref name="scientists religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|author2=Park, Jerry Z. |title=Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?|year=2009|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=276–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01447.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Ronald Numbers]] suggests the conflict theory lingers in a popular belief, inclusive of scientists and clerics alike, and that while history reflects an intrinsic and inevitable intellectual conflict between (Judeo-Christian) religion and science, it is perpetuated by the [[polemic]]s surrounding controversies involving [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]], and [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion|title=Statements from Religious Organizations|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging, for example, "school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have received criticism from mainstream [[Christianity]], members of the medical community, former members, and commentators regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|their beliefs]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices|practices]]. The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of [[blood transfusions]], particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of [[sexual abuse]] to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Failed predictions===
{{Main|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}
{{See also|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
The beliefs unique to Jehovah's Witnesses involve their interpretations of the [[second coming]] of Christ, the [[Millenarianism|millennium]] and the [[kingdom of God]]. [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] publications have made, and continue to make, predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | pages = 9, 115 | ISBN = 0-227-67939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those early predictions were described as "established truth",&lt;ref&gt;''The Time is at Hand'', Watch Tower Society, 1889, pages 99: "In view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth, that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the kingdom of God will be accomplished by A.D. 1914."; cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'beyond a doubt'.&lt;ref&gt;In 1892 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' stated that God's battle, Armageddon, which was believed to be already under way, would end in October 1914, a date "definitely marked in Scripture" (15 January 1892, page 1355 reprint), and ''Watch Tower'' editor Charles Taze Russell declared: 
: "We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, God's dates, not ours." (''The Watchtower'', 15 July 1894, page 1677).
After comparing "unreliable secular chronology" to reliable "Bible chronology", ''The Watchtower'' stated,
: “It was on this line of reckoning [using the chronology of the Bible as an established fact] that the dates 1874, 1914, and 1918 were located; and the Lord has placed the stamp of his seal upon 1914 and 1918 beyond any possibility of erasure....Using this same measuring line, beginning with the entry...of Israel into Canaan, and counting the full 70 cycles...,as clearly indicated by Jehovah's sending of the Jews into Babylon for the full 70 years, it is an easy matter to locate 1925, probably the fall, for the beginning of the antitypical jubilee. There can be no more question about 1925 than there was about 1914.... Looking back we can now easily see that those dates were clearly indicated in Scripture and doubtless intended by the Lord to encourage his people....That all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year will not alter the date one whit more than in the other cases.” (''The Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, p. 150; Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, page 224).&lt;/ref&gt;
Witnesses are told to 'be complete in accepting the visible organization's direction in every aspect' and that there is no need to question what God tells them through his Word and organization since love "believes all things."&lt;ref name="FollowingFaithful"&gt;"Following Faithful Shepherds with Life in View", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1967, page 591, "Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ. It is essential for life. Doing so, be complete in accepting its every aspect. We cannot claim to love God, yet deny his Word and channel of communication....Jehovah's visible organization is based firmly on the twelvefold foundation of the apostles of the Lamb with Jesus Christ himself being the foundation cornerstone.(Rev. 21:14,19;Eph 2:20-22) Therefore, in submitting to Jehovah's visible theocratic organization, we must be in full and complete agreement with every feature of its apostolic procedure and requirements."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |magazine= The Watchtower |date=15 July 1974 |page =441 |title= The Godly Qualities of Love and Hate |quote= Christians have implicit trust in their heavenly Father; they do not question what he tells them through his written Word and organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 174"&gt;Raymond Franz. ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 174, "No less serious is it when a group of men have divided views on predictions related to a certain date and yet present their adherents an outward appearance of united confidence, encouraging those adherents to place unwavering trust in those predictions."&lt;/ref&gt; If a member advocates views different to what appears in print, they face expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom |page= 629}} "people certainly ha[ve] the freedom to believe what they chose. But anyone who publicly or privately advocates views that are divergent from what appears in the publications of an organization, and who does so while claiming to represent that organization, causes division."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first= Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz |title= In Search of Christian Freedom |publisher= Commentary Press| year= 2007| location= Atlanta |pages= 18–28| isbn= 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Botting| first= Heather| author2 = Gary Botting |title= The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher= University of Toronto Press |year= 1984 |pages= 66–69| isbn= 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failed predictions that were either explicitly stated or strongly implied, particularly linked to dates in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925 and 1975, have led to the alteration or abandonment of some teachings. The Society's publications have at times suggested that members had previously "read into the ''Watch Tower'' statements that were never intended"&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', Watch Tower Society, 1959, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the beliefs of members were "based on wrong premises."&lt;ref&gt;"A Solid Basis for Confidence", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1976, page 440.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor Edmond Gruss, other failed predictions were ignored, and replaced with new predictions; for example, in the book, ''The Finished Mystery'' (1917), events were applied to the years 1918 to 1925 that earlier had been held to occur prior to 1914. When the new interpretations also did not transpire, the 1926 edition of the book changed the statements and removed the dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Gruss| first = Edmond C.| title = The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation| publisher = Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co| year = 1972| pages = 87–88| isbn = 0-87552-306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has cited publications that claimed God has used Jehovah's Witnesses as a collective prophet.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2002, pg. 173, Franz quotes from "They Shall Know That a Prophet Was Among Them", (''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972,) which states that God had raised Jehovah's Witnesses as "a prophet to help [people], to warn them of dangers and declare things to come". He also cites "Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his "true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true", in contrast to "false messengers", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, "a genuine prophet within our generation". The Watch Tower book noted: "Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them." He also cites "Execution of the Great Harlot Nears", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses "special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end".&lt;/ref&gt; Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as "pathetic".&lt;ref&gt;James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, {{ISBN|0-920413-37-4}}, pages 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Criticisms of statements, such as those found below, are found in a number of books including Penton, M. James (1997) ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press; Franz, Raymond, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'' (2007) Commentary Press; Watters, Randall (2004) ''Thus Saith Jehovah's Witnesses'', Common Sense Publications; Reed, David A. (1990) ''Index of Watchtower Errors'', 1879 to 1989, Baker Books and at websites including [http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/index.php/watchtower_quotes/ Watchtower Information Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826172536/http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/index.php/watchtower_quotes/ |date=2006-08-26 }}; [http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/ Quotes-Watchtower.co.uk]; [http://www.reexamine.org/quotes/ Reexamine.Quotes].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldeck, Val ''Jehovah's Witnesses: What do they believe?''.

''Let No One Mislead You''. iUniverse. {{ISBN|0-595-30710-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beverley says the Watch Tower Society has passed judgment on others who have falsely predicted the end of the world (he cites a 1968 ''Awake!'' article that says other groups were "guilty of false prophesying" after having "predicted an 'end to the world', even announcing a specific date").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchtowerwiki.org/files/1968_Oct_8_Awake_BW.pdf|title=''Awake!'', October 8, 1968, p. 23.|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, {{ISBN|0-920413-37-4}}, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Why So Many False Alarms?", ''Awake!'', March 22, 1993, pages 3-4, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, pg 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It admits its explanations of Bible prophecy are not infallible&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - Its Grand Climax'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March 1, 1904 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' p. 67, "We have in the Scriptures what we think is clear testimony respecting that date [1914], but no particulars or dates for the intervening time. It is not our intention to enter upon the role of prophet to any degree, but merely to give below what seems to us rather likely to be the trend of events."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Views From the Watchtower", ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence'', January 1908, "We are not prophesying; we are merely giving our surmises ... We do not even [assert] that there is no mistake in our interpretation of prophesy and our calculations of chronology. We have merely laid these before you, leaving it for each to exercise his own faith or doubt in respect to them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Preaching Christ—Through Envy or Goodwill?", ''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1976, p. 297, "Jehovah’s Witnesses as modern-day Christians are working hard to get this good news preached to every individual. They do not claim infallibility or perfection. Neither are they inspired prophets."&lt;/ref&gt; and that its predictions are not claimed explicitly as "the words of Jehovah."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; It states that some of its expectations have needed adjustment because of eagerness for God's kingdom, but that those adjustments are no reason to "call into question the whole body of truth."&lt;ref&gt;"Allow No Place for the Devil!", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1986, page 19, "Some opposers claim that Jehovah’s Witnesses are false prophets. These opponents say that dates have been set, but nothing has happened. ... Yes, Jehovah’s people have had to revise expectations from time to time. Because of our eagerness, we have hoped for the new system earlier than Jehovah’s timetable has called for it. But we display our faith in God’s Word and its sure promises by declaring its message to others. Moreover, the need to revise our understanding somewhat does not make us false prophets or change the fact that we are living in 'the last days,' ... How foolish to take the view that expectations needing some adjustment should call into question the whole body of truth! The evidence is clear that Jehovah has used and is continuing to use his one organization."&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Franz claims that the Watch Tower Society tries to evade its responsibility when citing human fallibility as a defense, adding that the Society represents itself as God's appointed spokesman, and that throughout its history has made many emphatic predictions. Franz adds that the organization's eagerness for the Millennium does not give it license to impugn the motives of those who fail to accept its predictions.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 174" /&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses "keep changing the dates" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions. Chryssides states, "For the Jehovah’s Witnesses prophecy serves more as a way of discerning a divine plan in human history than a means to predicting the future."&lt;ref name="Georgie"&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2010/to-chryssides.htm George Chryssides, ''They Keep Changing the Dates'', A paper presented at the CESNUR 2010 conference in Torino.] [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/IJSNR/article/viewFile/8147/pdf How Prophecy Succeeds: The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Expectations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictions (by date of publication) include:
*'''1877:''' Christ's kingdom would hold full sway over the earth in 1914; the Jews, as a people, would be restored to God's favor; the "saints" would be carried to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taze Russell and Nelson H. Barbour, ''The Three Worlds'' (1907) as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', pages 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1891:''' 1914 would be "the farthest limit of the rule of imperfect men."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taze Russell, ''The Time Is At Hand'' (1891) as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1904:''' "World-wide anarchy" would follow the end of the Gentile Times in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin D. Curry, ''Jehovah's Witnesses: The Millenarian World of the Watch Tower'', Garland, 1992, as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1916:''' World War I would terminate in Armageddon and the rapture of the "saints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penton |first=James |title=Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |location= |isbn=978-0802079732 |page=46 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1917:''' In 1918, Christendom would go down as a system to oblivion and be succeeded by revolutionary governments. God would "destroy the churches wholesale and the church members by the millions." Church members would "perish by the sword of war, revolution and anarchy." The dead would lie unburied. In 1920 all earthly governments would disappear, with worldwide anarchy prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917, p. 485, 258, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 206-211.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1920:''' Messiah's kingdom would be established in 1925 and bring worldwide peace. God would begin restoring the earth. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and other faithful patriarchs would be resurrected to perfect human life and be made princes and rulers, the visible representatives of the New Order on earth. Those who showed themselves obedient to God would never die.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Rutherford, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', 1920, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 212-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1922:''' The anti-typical "jubilee" that would mark God's intervention in earthly affairs would take place "probably the fall" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1924:''' God's restoration of Earth would begin "shortly after" October 1, 1925. [[Jerusalem]] would be made the world's capital. Resurrected "princes" such as [[Abel]], [[Noah]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]] would give instructions to their subjects around the world by radio, and airplanes would transport people to and from Jerusalem from all parts of the globe in just "a few hours".&lt;ref&gt;''The Way to Paradise'' booklet, Watch Tower Society, 1924, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1938:''' Armageddon was too close for marriage or child bearing.&lt;ref&gt;''Face the Facts'', 1938, pp. 46-50&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1941:''' There were only "months" remaining until Armageddon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1941, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1942:''' Armageddon was "immediately before us."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1942, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1961:''' ''Awake!'' magazine stated that Armageddon "will come in the twentieth century. ... This generation will see its fulfillment."&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', February 22, 1961, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1966:''' It would be 6000 years since man's creation in the fall of 1975 and it would be "appropriate" for Christ's thousand-year reign to begin at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Life Everlasting in Freedom of the Sons of God|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=1966|url=http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/lifeeverlasting/1966_Life_Everlasting.pdf|pages=29–35}}, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Time was "running out, no question about that."&lt;ref&gt;Talk by F. W. Franz, Baltimore, Maryland 1966, cited by ''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, and by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The "immediate future" was "certain to be filled with climactic events ... within a few years at most", the final parts of Bible prophecy relating to the "last days" would undergo fulfillment as Christ's reign began.
*'''1967:''' The end-time period (beginning in 1914) was claimed to be so far advanced that the time remaining could "be compared, not just to the last day of a week, but rather, to the last part of that day".&lt;ref&gt;''Did Man Get Here By Evolution Or By Creation?'', Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1967, pg 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1968:''' No one could say "with certainty" that the battle of [[Armageddon]] would begin in 1975, but time was "running out rapidly" with "earthshaking events" soon to take place.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1968, page 273&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1968 there was a "short period of time left", with "only about ninety months left before 6000 years of man's existence on earth is completed".&lt;ref&gt;''Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Society, March 1968, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 246.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1969:''' The existing world order would not last long enough for young people to grow old; the world system would end "in a few years." Young Witnesses were told not to bother pursuing tertiary education for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', May 22, 1969, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1984:''' There were "many indications" that "the end" was closer than the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1984, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Watch Tower Society literature claims the Society's founder, [[Charles Taze Russell]], was directed by God's Holy Spirit, through which he received "flashes of light",&lt;ref&gt;"Flashes of Light - Great and Small", ''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1995, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; it has substantially altered doctrines since its inception and abandoned many of Russell's teachings.&lt;ref name=Franz184&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the changes have involved biblical chronology that had earlier been claimed as beyond question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 1894|page=1677|quote=We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would.

*''Date of beginning of Christ's kingdom rule''. Russell taught that Jesus had become king in April 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Scriptures Vol. II 1889 p. 239, Studies in the Scriptures Volume III 1891 p. 234, Studies in Scriptures Vol. IV 1897 p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 632.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Joseph Rutherford altered the date to 1914.&lt;ref name=Franz184 /&gt;
*''Date of resurrection of anointed Christians''. After the failure of predictions that Christ's chosen "saints" would be carried away to heaven in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, pages 20, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell developed the teaching that those "dying in the Lord" from 1878 forward would have an immediate heavenly resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Watch Tower'' confirmed the doctrine in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', February 1, 1925, page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; but two years later asserted this date was wrong&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', May 15, 1927, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the beginning of the instant resurrection to heaven for faithful Christians was from 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', June 1, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Great Pyramid as a "stone witness" of God''. Russell wrote in 1910 that God had the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt built as a testimony to the truth of the Bible and proof of its chronology identifying the "last days".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html "The Corroborative Testimony of God's Stone Witness and Prophet, The Great Pyramid in Egypt", Chapter 10, ''Thy Kingdom Come'', third volume of Studies in the Scriptures, 1910].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', June 15, 1922, page 187, as reproduced by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 225, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Rutherford rejected the doctrine and claimed the Pyramid had been built under the direction of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', 1928, pages 339-45, 355-62, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Identity of "faithful and wise servant"''. Russell initially believed the "faithful and wise servant" of Matthew 24:45 was "every member of this body of Christ ... the whole body individually and collectively."&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', October–November 1881, as cited by ''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 he had altered his view and began explaining it was a person, not the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle of Armageddon'' by C. T. Russell, 1886, page 613, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', footnote, page 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell accepted claims by Bible Students that he was that "servant"&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', December 1, 1916, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', March 1, 1923, pages 68 and 71, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 626, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1909 described as his "opponents" those who would apply the term "faithful and wise servant" to "all the members of the church of Christ" rather than to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', October 1, 1909, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927 the Watch Tower Society was teaching that it was "a collective servant."&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 626.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Beginning of the "last days"''. From the earliest issues of the ''Watch Tower'', Russell promoted the belief that the "last days" had begun in 1799 and would ''end'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''Thy Kingdom Come'', 1891, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1921 Watch Tower publications were still claiming the last days had begun in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harp of God'', (1921), 1924 ed., p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 that date was abandoned and 1914 was fixed as the ''beginning'' of the last days.
*''Jews' role in God's Kingdom''. Russell followed the view of [[Nelson H. Barbour]], who believed that in 1914 Christ's kingdom would take power over all the earth and the Jews, as a people, would be restored to God's favor.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', pages 21, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Russell wrote that with the completion of the "Gentile Times" in 1914, Israel's "blindness" would subside and they would convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Russell, ''The Time Is At Hand'' (Watch Tower Society, 1889, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 190, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Life'' (1929) noted that the return of Jews to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] signaled that the end was very close, because Jews would "have the favors first and thereafter all others who obey the Lord" under God's restoration of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', Watch Tower Society, 1929, page 170, as cited by Edmond C. Gruss, ''The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation'', Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 that belief was abandoned and from that date the Watch Tower Society taught that Witnesses alone were the Israel of God.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Rutherford, ''Vindication - Book II'', pages 257-258, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Date of Christ's invisible presence''. The Watch Tower Society taught for more than 60 years that this began in 1874, insisting in 1922 that the date was "indisputable".&lt;ref name="Watch Tower 1922, page 228"&gt;''Watch Tower'', November 1, 1922, page 333, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1922, "The indisputable facts, therefore, show that the time of the end began in 1799; that the Lord's second presence began in 1874".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 the society moved the event to 1914.&lt;ref name=Franz184 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, pages 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"No Spiritual Energy Crisis for Discreet Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 15, 1974, page 507, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Identity of the "superior authorities"''. Russell taught that the "superior authorities" of Romans 13:1, to whom Christians had to show subjection and obedience, were governmental authorities. In 1929 ''The Watchtower'' discarded this view, stating that the term referred only to God and Christ, and saying the change of doctrine was evidence of "advancing light" of truth shining forth to God's chosen people.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484"&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', 2007, page 484.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, ''The Watchtower'' stated that the words of Romans 13 "could never have applied to the political powers of Caesar’s world as wrongly claimed by the clergy of Christendom,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1952, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960 ''The Watchtower'' described the earlier view as a factor that had caused the Bible Student movement to be "unclean" in God's eyes during the 1914–1918 period. Two years later, in 1962, ''The Watchtower'' reverted to Russell's initial doctrine.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484"/&gt;
*''Identity and function of the Governing Body''. Frequent mentions of the term "Governing Body" began in Watch Tower Society literature in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 107| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governing Body was initially identified as the Watch Tower Society's seven-member board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;''Qualified To Be Ministers'', Watch Tower Society, 1955, page 381, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, the board played no role in establishing Watchtower doctrines, and all such decisions since the Society's origins had been made by the Society's president.&lt;ref&gt;Marley Cole, ''Jehovah's Witnesses - The New World Society'', Vantage Press, New York, 1955, pages 86-89, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony by Fred Franz, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh Transcript, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh, 1954, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1923 ''Watch Tower'' noted that Russell alone directed the policy and course of the Society "without regard to any other person on earth"&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', March 1, 1923, page 68, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and both his successors, Rutherford and Knorr, also acted alone in establishing Watch Tower doctrines. An organizational change on January 1, 1976, for the first time gave the Governing Body the power to rule on doctrines&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, pages 58-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and become the ruling council of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', 1997, page 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, ''The Watchtower'' in 1971 claimed that a Governing Body of anointed Christians had existed since the 19th century to govern the affairs of God's anointed people.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1971, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Treatment of disfellowshipped persons''. In the 1950s when disfellowshipping became common, Witnesses were to have nothing to do with expelled members, not conversing with or acknowledging them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', July 1, 1963, page 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Family members of expelled individuals were permitted occasional "contacts absolutely necessary in matters pertaining to family interests," but could not discuss spiritual matters with them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1963, page 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 ''The Watchtower'', acknowledging some unbalanced Witnesses had displayed unkind, inhumane and possibly cruel attitudes to those expelled,&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, pages 467, "It is right to hate the wrong committed by the disfellowshiped one, but it is not right to hate the person nor is it right to treat such ones in an inhumane way."&lt;/ref&gt; relaxed restrictions on family contact, allowing families to choose for themselves the extent of association,&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, pages 471-472.&lt;/ref&gt; including whether or not to discuss some spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, page 471, par 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a reversal of policy occurred, with Witnesses instructed to avoid all spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped ones, including with close relatives.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1981, page 28"&gt;"If a Relative Is Disfellowshiped", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses were instructed not to greet disfellowshipped persons.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1981, page 28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If a Relative Is Disfellowshiped", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents were permitted to care for the physical needs of a disfellowshipped minor child; ill parents or physically or emotionally ill child could be accepted back into the home "for a time". Witnesses were instructed not to eat with disfellowshipped relatives and were warned that emotional influence could soften their resolve.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 20-31, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the Witnesses' Brooklyn headquarters advised traveling overseers that a person need not be ''promoting'' "apostate views" to warrant disfellowshipping; it advised that "appropriate judicial action" be taken against a person who "continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided" through ''The Watchtower''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to all circuit and district overseers from Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of New York, September 1, 1980, as reproduced by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules on shunning were extended in 1981 to include those who had resigned from the group voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 23, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 357-359.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Fall of "Babylon the Great".'' Russell taught that the fall of the "world empire of false religion" had taken place in 1878 and predicted "Babylon's" complete destruction in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', June 15, 1911, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford claimed in 1917 that religion's final destruction would take place in 1918, explaining that God would destroy churches "wholesale" and that "Christendom shall go down as a system to oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917, p. 485, 258, 513 as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 206-211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the Watch Tower Society claimed that release from prison in 1919 of senior Watchtower figures marked the fall of Babylon "as far as having any captive hold on God's people was concerned",&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - It's Grand Climax at Hand!'', Watch Tower Society, 1988, page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; with her "final destruction" "into oblivion, never to recover", expected "in the near future."&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - It's Grand Climax at Hand!'', Watch Tower Society, 1988, pages 266, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations association===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and the United Nations}}
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the United Nations is one of the 'superior authorities' that exist by God's permission, and that it serves a purpose in maintaining order, but do not support it politically and do not consider it to be the means to achieve peace and security. Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that the United Nations is the "[[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|image of the wild beast]]" of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:1-18, and the second fulfilment of the "abominable thing that causes desolation" from Matthew 24:15; that it will be the means for the devastation of organized false religion worldwide;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2001844#h=17 "No Calamity Will Befall Us" (Subheading)].

''The Watchtower'', p 14&lt;/ref&gt; and that, like all other political powers, it will be destroyed and replaced by God's heavenly kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;"A World Without War-When?" Oct.1, 1991, pp.5 ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses have denounced other religious organizations for having offered political support to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', 1 June 1997, p. 17 par. 15: "In the first place, what lies ahead for the world's false religions that have so often been extremely friendly with the UN? They are the offspring of one idolatrous fountainhead, ancient Babylon. Appropriately, they are described at Revelation 17:5 as "Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth". Jeremiah described the doom of this hypocritical conglomerate. Harlotlike, they have seduced earth's politicians, flattering the UN and forming illicit relations with its member political powers."&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2001, an article was published in the British ''Guardian'' newspaper questioning the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society's registration as a non-governmental organization ([[non-governmental organization|NGO]]) with the [[United Nations]] Department of Public Information and accusing the Watch Tower Society of hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Stephen (Oct. 8, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,565199,00.html "Jehovah's Witnesses link to UN queried"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the article's publication, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society submitted a formal request for disassociation, removing all association with the United Nations Department of Public Information,&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Stephen (Oct. 15, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4277197,00.html "'Hypocrite' Jehovah's Witnesses abandon secret link with UN"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; and released a letter stating that the reason for becoming associated with the United Nations Department of Information (DPI) was to access their facilities, and that they had not been aware of the change in language contained in the criteria for NGO association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randytv.com/secret/enclosure4USE.jpg Letter to Editor - The Guardian"] (Oct. 22, 2001) ''Office of Public Information''&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Watch Tower Society sought NGO association, "the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations", acknowledging that the purpose of membership is to "promote knowledge of the principles and activities of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from United Nations DPI/NGO Resource Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Jerusalem===
Jehovah's Witnesses assert that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC and completely uninhabited for exactly seventy years. This date is critical to their selection of October 1914 for the arrival of Christ in kingly power—2520 years after October 607 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Pay Attention to Daniel's Prophecy!'' chap. 6 par. 25-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gruss&gt;Edmond C. Gruss, ''Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation'', Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, {{ISBN|0-87552-306-4}} Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Witness sources do not support 607 BC for the event, placing the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]] within a year of 587 BC, twenty years later.&lt;ref name=gruss /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rogerson, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, 1969, page 105, "Secular historians put this date as 586 or 587 BC but the Witnesses, following Russell, place it at 607 BC."&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses believe that periods of seventy years mentioned in the books of Jeremiah and Daniel refer to the Babylonian exile of Jews. They also believe that the gathering of Jews in Jerusalem, shortly after their return from Babylon, officially ended the exile in Jewish month of ''[[Tishrei]]'' (Ezra 3:1). According to the Watch Tower Society, October 607 BC is derived by counting back seventy years from ''Tishrei'' of 537 BC, based on their belief that Cyrus' decree to release the Jews during his first regnal year "may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C."&lt;ref name="WT 10/1"&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011736 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part One]" ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2011, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|title=Evidences of the Year’s Correctness|date=May 1, 1952|pages=271–2|quote = It was in this first regnal year of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. (Ezra 1:1) The decree may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C. In either case this would have given sufficient time for the large party of 49,897 Jews to organize their expedition and to make their long four-month journey from Babylon to Jerusalem to get there by September 29–30, 537 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month, to build their altar to Jehovah as recorded at Ezra 3:1-3. Inasmuch as September 29–30, 537 B.C., officially ends the seventy years of desolation as recorded at 2 Chronicles 36:20, 21, so the beginning of the desolation of the land must have officially begun to be counted after September 21–22, 607 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month in 607 B.C., which is the beginning point for the counting of the 2,520 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular sources assign the return to either 538 BC or 537 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47693/Babylonian-Exile |title=Babylonian Exile |date=February 26, 2016 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/exile2.html |title=Timeline of Judaism after the Babylonian Exile (538 BCE-70 CE) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keller | first = Werner | title = The Bible As History| publisher = Bantam; 2 Revised edition | year = 1983| page = 352 | isbn =0-553-27943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Bible: Biographical, Geographical, Historical and Doctrinal'' by Charles Randall Barnes, Page 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dyer | first = Charles | title = Nelson’s Old Testament survey: Discovering essence, Background &amp; Meaning about Every Old Testament book| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology &amp; Christ's Return'', Carl O. Jonsson, a former Witness, presents eighteen lines of evidence to support the traditional view of neo-Babylonian chronology. He accuses the Watch Tower Society of deliberately misquoting sources in an effort to bolster their position.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology &amp; Christ's Return'' by Carl O. Jonsson. {{ISBN|0-914675-06-0}} Publisher: Commentary Press (July, 1998, Fourth edition 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society claims that biblical chronology is not always compatible with secular sources, and that the Bible is superior. It claims that secular historians make conclusions about 587 BC based on incorrect or inconsistent historical records, but accepts those sources that identify Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BC, claiming it has no evidence of being inconsistent and hence can be used as a pivotal date.&lt;ref name="WT 10/1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011810 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part Two]" ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2011, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003156#h=17 ''Insight on the Scriptures''. Vol.2 page 459], "secular chronologers calculate the 16th day of Tashritu (Tishri) as falling on October 11, Julian calendar, and October 5, Gregorian calendar, in the year 539 B.C.E. Since this date is an accepted one, there being no evidence to the contrary, it is usable as a pivotal date in coordinating secular history with Bible history."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rolf Furuli]], a Jehovah's Witness and a lecturer in Semitic languages, presents a study of 607 BC in support of the Witnesses' conclusions in ''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews'' (2003) {{ISBN|82-994633-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lester L. Grabbe, professor of theology at the University of Hull, said of Furuli's study: "Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship. ... F. shows little evidence of having put his theories to the test with specialists in Mesopotamian astronomy and Persian history."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'' 28:5 [2004], p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative positions of the moon, stars and planets indicated in the [[Babylonian astronomical diary]] ''VAT 4956'' are used by secular historians to establish 568 BC as the thirty-seventh year of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stephenson |first1=F.

===Evolution===
The Watch Tower Society teaches a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|title=Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dismisses [[Young Earth creationism]] as "unscriptural and unbelievable",&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1986, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and states that Jehovah's Witnesses "are not creationists" on the basis that they do not believe the earth was created in six literal days.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', May 8, 1997, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications attempt to refute the [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]], in favor of divine [[creationism|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Life — How Did It Get Here? By Evolution Or By Creation?'', Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Was Life Created?'', Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society's views of evolution have met with criticism typical of [[objections to evolution]]. [[Gary Botting]] described his own difficulty as a Jehovah's Witness to reconcile creation with simple observations of species diversification, especially after discussions with [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Preface" to ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'', pp. xiv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's 1985 publication, ''Life—How Did it Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?'' is criticized for its dependency on [[Francis Hitching]], who is cited thirteen times. The book presents Hitching—a TV writer and paranormalist with no scientific credentials—as an evolutionary scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Hitching is first introduced as an "evolutionist" (p. 15). A Hitching quote on page 71 is repeated on page 73, in the latter case presented as the statement of "a scientist". The 1986 Watchtower book ''The Bible — God's Word or Man's?'' likewise refers to Hitching as a scientist (p. 106).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] also criticizes the book for implying that "chance" is the only alternative to deliberate design, stating, "[T]he candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and [[natural selection]]."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins: ''The God Delusion'', p. 145. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 2006. {{ISBN|0-618-68000-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covington said of Jehovah's Witnesses: "We must have unity ... unity at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;Court transcript as cited by Heather &amp; Gary Botting, ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 1984, page 67-68, also at [http://cchasson.free.fr/deposit/trial/Walsh_Trial.pdf Pursuer's Proof: Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh Transcript, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh, 1954].&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that Witnesses are subject to a disciplinary system that encourages informants.&lt;ref name=Franz11&gt;R.

Franz and others have described Jehovah's Witnesses' meetings as "catechistical" question-and-answer sessions in which questions and answers are both provided by the organization, placing pressure on members to reiterate its opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Franz |first=Raymond |title=In Search of Christian Freedom |publisher=Commentary Press |year=2007 |edition=2nd |pages = 419–421|isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stevenson | first = W.C.| title = Year of Doom 1975: The Inside Story of Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co | year = 1967 | location = London | pages = 33–35 | quote= The inevitable result of a person's submitting to (the home Bible study) arrangement is that eventually all his own thoughts will be replaced by the thoughts contained in the book he is studying ... if one were able to watch this person's development ... it would be quite obvious that he was gradually losing all individuality of thought and action ...

&lt;!--Defense from Jehovah's witnesses--&gt;
The Society has described its intolerance of dissident and divergent doctrinal views within its ranks as "strict", but claims its stance is based on the scriptural precedent of 2&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;2:17, 18 in which the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] condemns [[Christian heresy|heretics]] [[Hymenaeus (Ephesian)|Hymenaeus]] and [[Philetus (Ephesian)|Philetus]] who denied the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. It said: "Following such Scriptural patterns, if a Christian (who claims belief in God, the Bible, and Jesus) unrepentantly promotes false teachings, it may be necessary for him to be expelled from the congregation ... Hence, the true Christian congregation cannot rightly be accused of being harshly dogmatic."&lt;ref&gt;"Questions from readers", ''Watchtower'', April 1, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Conclusion with scholars--&gt;
Sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] says that Jehovah's Witness leaders are "not always very democratic" and members are expected to conform to "rather strict standards", but that enforcement tends to be informal, sustained by close bonds of friendship, and that Jehovah's Witnesses see themselves as "part of the power structure rather than subject to it".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;{{Citation|title=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]|contribution=Why the Jehovah's Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application|contribution-url=http://www.theocraticlibrary.com/downloads/Why_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_Grow_So_Rapidly.pdf|year=1997|pages=142–143|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-30|author=Stark and Iannoccone|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[James A.

Jehovah's Witnesses state that they are not a cult&lt;ref&gt;"Are Jehovah's Witnesses a Cult?", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1994, pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; and say that although individuals need proper guidance from God, they should do their own thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Others Do Your Thinking?", ''Awake!'', August 22, 1978, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Who Molds Your Thinking?", ''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1999, page 22, "You have free will.

===Coercion===
Since 1920 the Watch Tower Society has required all congregation members participating in the preaching work to turn in written reports of the amount of their activity,&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', page 96, as cited by R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that the reports help the Society to plan its activities and identify areas of greater need&lt;ref&gt;Question Box, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1979, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and help congregation elders to identify those who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Do You Contribute to an Accurate Report?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', December 2002, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 the Society imposed personal quotas, requiring all active Witnesses to spend at least 60 hours of door-to-door preaching per month, claiming these were "directions from the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;"Righteous requirements", ''Watchtower'', July 1, 1943, pages 204-206, "Jehovah ... has appointed his 'faithful and wise servant, who is his visible mouthpiece ... These expressions of God's will by his King and through his established agency constitute his law or rule of action ... The Lord breaks down our organization instructions further ... He says the requirements for special pioneers shall be 175 hours and 50 back-calls per month ... and for regular pioneers 150 hours ... And for company publishers, he says, 'Let us make a quota of 60 hours and 12 back-calls and at least one study a week for each publisher'. These directions come to us from the Lord through his established agency directing what is required of us ... This expression of the Lord's will should be the end of all controversy ... The Lord through his 'faithful and wise servant' now states to us, ''Let us cover our territory four times in six months''. That becomes our organization instructions and has the same binding force on us that his statement to the Logos had when he said, 'Let us make man in our image'. It is our duty to accept this additional instruction and obey it."&lt;/ref&gt; Although these quotas were subsequently removed, Raymond Franz claims "invisible" quotas remained, obliging Witnesses to meet certain levels of preaching work to remain in good standing in the congregation&lt;ref name=Franz16&gt;R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; or to qualify for eldership.&lt;ref name=Franz6 /&gt; Franz describes repeated urging for adherents to "put kingdom interests first" and devote increasing amounts of time to door-to-door preaching efforts as coercive pressure. He says many Witnesses constantly feel guilty that they are not doing more in "field activity".&lt;ref name=Franz6&gt;R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Witnesses Heather and Gary Botting, claiming an emphasis on a personal track record would mean that salvation is effectively being "bought" with "good works", observed: "No matter how long a Witness remains an active distributor of literature, the moment he ceases to be active he is regarded by his peers as good as dead in terms of achieving the ultimate goal of life everlasting in an earthly paradise ... Few realize upon entering the movement that the purchase price is open-ended and that the bill can never be paid in full until death or the advent of Armageddon."&lt;ref name=orwell /&gt;

''The Watchtower'', however, noted that although public preaching is necessary, such works do not "save" a Christian and it urged Witnesses to examine their motive for engaging in preaching activity.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005404 Saved, Not by Works Alone, But by Undeserved Kindness]", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 2005, pages 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Andrew Holden, "those who fail to devote a satisfactory amount of time to doorstep evangelism (currently around seventeen hours per month in the United States) soon lose the respect of their co-religionists and may even be disfellowshipped. The Witnesses are thus forced to think quantitatively about their salvation."{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=72}}

Medical and legal commentators have noted cases, claiming that Witness medical patients were coerced to obey the denomination's ban on blood transfusions.&lt;ref name=Vancouver&gt;[https://culteducation.com/group/1267-jehovah-s-witnesses/11230-jehovahs-witnesses-case-heads-to-bc-court.html “Jehovah's Witnesses case heads to B.C. court”, Vancouver Sun, April 1, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulsus.com/journals/abstract.jsp?HCtype=Consumer&amp;sCurrPg=journal&amp;jnlKy=5&amp;atlKy=6964&amp;isuKy=460&amp;spage=1&amp;isArt=t&amp;|title=Pulsus Group - Journals|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528596/ Paediatr Child Health, Medical emergencies in children of orthodox Jehovah’s Witness families: Three recent legal cases, ethical issues and proposals for management]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Osamu Muramoto, in the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', those who unrepentantly receive prohibited blood products are labeled "apostates", expelled, and shunned by other Jehovah's Witness friends or family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377670 | pmid=9752623 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 1.

In a case involving a review of a Russian district court decision, the European Court of Human Rights found nothing in the judgements to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." The court said: "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others." However, the court acknowledged that coercion by the group to reject blood transfusion may be involved, stating "even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shunning===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline|Shunning}}
Witnesses practice disfellowshipping of members who unrepentantly engage in "gross sin",&lt;ref name="accept"&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006845 Always Accept Jehovah’s Discipline]", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 2006, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; (most commonly for breaches of the Witnesses' code of personal morality),&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002725 Cultivate Obedience as the End Draws Near]", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2002, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beckford | first = James A. |authorlink = James A.

The Watch Tower Society has attracted criticism for disfellowshipping members who decide they cannot conscientiously agree with all the denomination's teachings and practices. Sociologist Andrew Holden says that because the group provides no valid reason for leaving, those who do choose to leave are regarded as traitors.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=150}} According to Raymond Franz, those who decide they cannot accept Watch Tower teachings and practices often live in a climate of fear, feeling they must constantly be on guard about what they say, do and read. He says those who do express any disagreement, even in a private conversation with friends, risk investigation and trial by a judicial committee as apostates or heretics&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 384| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classed as "wicked".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 351| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz argues that the threat of expulsion for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 359| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=151}} Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism&lt;!--does source say "ultimate control mechanism"?--&gt;&lt;!--yes--&gt; among the Witnesses;&lt;ref name="Penton249"&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=163}} Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lawson, "Sect-State Relations: Accounting for the Differing Trajectories of Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses," ''Sociology of Religion'', 1995, 56:4, pg 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications defend the practice of expelling and shunning those who "promote false teaching", claiming such individuals must be quarantined to prevent the spread of their "spiritual infection".&lt;ref&gt;"Maintain Your Faith and Spiritual Health", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They have cited a dictionary definition of apostasy ("renunciation of a religious faith, abandonment of a previous loyalty") to rule that an individual who begins affiliating with another religious organization has disassociated from the Witnesses, warranting their shunning to protect the spiritual cleanness of the Witness congregation on the basis of the reference in 1 John 2:19 that those who leave Christianity are "not of our sort".&lt;ref&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1986, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's acceptance of a blood transfusion is similarly deemed as evidence of disassociation.&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Muramoto, "Bioethical aspects of the recent changes in the policy of refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses", ''British Medical Journal'', January 6, 2001, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; They say Witnesses also obey the "strong counsel" at 1 Corinthians 5:11 that Christians should "quit mixing in company" with people who unrepentantly reject certain scriptural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ridley | first1 = Donald T. | year = 1999 | title = Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal of blood: Obedience to scripture and religious conscience | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 25 | issue = | page = 470 | doi=10.1136/jme.25.6.469| pmc = 479295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Witnesses' judicial process has also been criticized. Hearings take place in secret,&lt;ref name="Penton249" /&gt; with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Penton, M. J. 1997 89"/&gt; According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but are not permitted to remain for the discussion.&lt;ref name="Franz38"&gt;{{Citation|author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2002|page=38|isbn=0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.&lt;ref name="Botting91"&gt;{{Citation| last = Botting| first = Heather | author2 = Gary Botting| title = The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1984| page= 91|isbn = 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a decision is made regarding disfellowshipping or disassociation, an announcement is made that the person is "no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses," at which point shunning is immediate. Members are not told whether the person has disassociated or has been disfellowshipped. Neither testimony nor evidence in support of the judicial decision are provided. Congregation members are told to accept the rulings without question and Witnesses who refuse to abide by a judicial committee decision will themselves suffer expulsion.&lt;ref name="Penton249" /&gt; Members are forbidden to talk with the expelled member, removing any opportunity for the person to discuss or explain their actions.&lt;ref name="Franz38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 371| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penton claims judicial committee members and the Watch Tower Society frequently ignore established procedures when dealing with troublesome individuals, conspiring to have them expelled in violation of Society rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that Witness policies encourage an informer system to report to elders Witnesses suspected of having committed an act that could warrant expulsion, including deviating from organizational policies and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', Commentary Press, pages 365-385, citing "A Time to Speak – When?", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Muramoto, "Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah’s Witnesses, Part 1", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also been directed at the 1981 change of policy&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower,'' September 15, 1981, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were to be treated as though they were disfellowshipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2002|page=357|isbn=0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden says that as a result, those who do leave are seldom allowed a dignified exit.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=163}} Heather and Gary Botting claim inactive Witnesses are often pressured to either become active or to disassociate themselves by declaring they no longer accept key Watch Tower Society doctrines.&lt;ref name="Botting91" /&gt;

===Blood===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}
Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions of whole allogenic blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as [[Leviticus]] 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion.&lt;ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.&lt;ref name="Muramoto"/&gt;

====Fractions and components====
In the case of [[Blood plasma fractionation|minor fractions derived from blood]], each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004445 Be guided by the Living God]" (Jun. 15, 2004). ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000447 Questions from readers: Do Jehovah's Witnesses accept any minor fractions of blood?]" (Jun. 15, 2000). ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some Jehovah's Witnesses accept the use of blood fractions and others do not. However, fractions that carry out "the key function of a primary component" or make up "a significant portion of that component" are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006283#h=13 ''Awake!'' August 2006 box on P. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a stance of dividing blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components to be poured out onto the ground has led to criticism from organizations such as the ''Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajwrb.org/|title=AJWRB.org|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid ''per se'' is not the real issue. They say the real issue is ''respect'' and ''obedience'' regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' November 1, 1961, p. 669 Questions From Readers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005143#h=16 ''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'' 2005 P.128]&lt;/ref&gt; Members are allowed to eat [[meat]] that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the ''respect'' has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |title=OK Kosher Certification — Salting of Meat |publisher=Ok.org |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |title=Making Meat Kosher: Between Slaughtering and Cooking |publisher=My Jewish Learning |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to lawyer Kerry Louderback-Wood, a former Jehovah's Witness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm "Religion Today", ''New York Times'', January 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427200056/http://www.marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm |date=April 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Watch Tower Society misrepresents the scope of allowed fractions. If taken together, they "total the entire volume of blood they came from".&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005 p. 815&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this can be seen in blood plasma, which consists of 90-96% water. The remaining amount consists mainly of albumin, globulins, fibrinogen and coagulation factors. These four fractions are allowable for use, but only if taken separately. Raymond Franz has likened this to banning the eating of a ham and cheese sandwich but allowing the eating of bread, ham and cheese separately.&lt;ref&gt;Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-914675-16-8}}. p.732.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storing and donation====
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that storing blood violates direction from the Bible to 'pour blood out onto the ground'. They do not donate blood except for uses they have individually pre-approved.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000767 Questions From Readers]", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2000, page 31, "Jehovah’s Witnesses...do not donate blood [without preconditions on its use], nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be ‘poured out.’ That practice conflicts with God’s law. Other procedures or tests involving an individual’s own blood are not so clearly in conflict with God’s stated principles. ...the goal may be to isolate some of a blood component and apply that elsewhere... A Christian must decide for himself how his own blood will be handled... Ahead of time, he should obtain from the doctor or technician the facts about what might be done with his blood during the procedure. Then he must decide according to what his conscience permits."&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are told that acceptance of blood fractions from donated blood is a matter of conscience. A 2006 issue of Jehovah's Witnesses' newsletter ''Our Kingdom Ministry'' stated, "Although [Jehovah's Witnesses] do not donate or store their own blood ''for transfusion purposes'', some procedures or tests involving an individual’s blood are not so clearly in conflict with Bible principles. Therefore, each individual should make a conscientious decision" [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;"How Do I View Blood Fractions and Medical Procedures Involving My Own Blood?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2006, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Franz has challenged these policies because acceptable blood fractions can only be derived from stored blood provided by donors.&lt;ref&gt;Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}.

Regardless of the medical considerations, Jehovah Witnesses advocate that physicians should uphold the right of a patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 Ivanhoe's Medical Breakthroughs - When Religion and Medicine Collide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125211155/http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 |date=2005-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out of his or her own requests.&lt;ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life"/&gt; However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a [[Jehovah's Witnesses and governments#Other cases|case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France]].

The situation has been controversial, particularly in the case of children. In the [[United States]], many physicians will agree to explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians. Some state laws require physicians to administer blood-based treatment to minors if it is their professional opinion that it is necessary to prevent immediate death or severe permanent damage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Even when an adult's life is at stake, some philosophers argue that since blood refusal is based on irrational beliefs, the patient's decision may be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1377366 | pmid=9358347 | volume=23 | title=Should informed consent be based on rational beliefs? | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=282–8 | last1 = Savulescu | first1 = J | last2 = Momeyer | first2 = RW | doi=10.1136/jme.23.5.282|quote=we believe that JWs' beliefs are irrational even in terms that should be acceptable to JWs.

Secondly, Paul warns against slavish obedience to law ... Paul himself does not understand The Bible to be literally true, as evidenced when he speaks of the story of the origin of Abraham's sons being "an allegory" ... What is required is rational argument. | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry Louderback-Wood has claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses' legal corporations are potentially liable to significant claims for compensation if the organization misrepresents the medical risks of blood transfusions. Wood claims that constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not remove the legal responsibility that every person or organization has regarding misrepresenting secular fact.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal blood====
''The Watchtower'' has stated that "Various medical products have been obtained from biological sources, either animal or human ... Such commercialization of ... blood is hardly tempting for true Christians, who guide their thinking by God's perfect law. Our Creator views blood as sacred, representing God-given life ... blood removed from a creature was to be poured out on the ground, disposed of."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' (Feb. 1, 1997) p30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting of sexual abuse===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses' handling of child sex abuse |Silentlambs}}
Former Jehovah's Witness Bill Bower, founder of [[Silentlambs]], accuses [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] of employing organizational policies of not reporting [[sexual abuse]] cases to authorities to protect the organisation's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentlambs.org/historyofsl.htm Bill Bowen, "The History of Silentlambs"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religioustolerance]] site states that the consequence of keeping the cases secrets is that "there is a very high probability that the abuse will continue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness7.htm "Jehovah's Witnesses (WTS) Handling of Child Sexual Abuse Cases"], ''Religious Tolerance.org'' Retrieved Mar 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims of sexual abuse have asserted that when reporting abuse they were ordered to maintain silence by their local elders to avoid embarrassment to both the accused and the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/29/eveningnews/main551557.shtml "Another Church Sex Scandal"] (Apr. 29, 2003).

While a Witness may lose congregation privileges following a single credible accusation of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;“Let All Things Take Place for Upbuilding”, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', July 2000, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be scripturally obliged to require corroboration before applying their severest forms of congregational discipline.&lt;ref&gt;"Comfort for Those With a “Stricken Spirit”", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1995, page 28, "If the [lone] accusation is denied [by the accused], the elders should explain to the accuser that nothing more can be done in a judicial way. ...The Bible says that there must be two or three witnesses before judicial action can be taken.

==Biblical criticisms==
{{See also|New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures#Critical review}}
The [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] has been criticized for its refusal to reveal the names and academic credentials of the translators of its ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' (NWT).&lt;ref name="pentonbible"&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|pages=174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has claimed members of the NWT's translation committee wished to remain anonymous in order to exalt only the name of God,&lt;ref&gt;"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1950, page 320.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Watchtower'' stating that the educational qualifications of the translators were unimportant and that "the translation itself testifies to their qualifications".&lt;ref&gt;Questions from readers, ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1974, page 767.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Franz]], a former member of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]], has claimed that of the four men he says constituted the committee, only one—its principal translator, his uncle [[Frederick William Franz|Frederick Franz]]—had sufficient knowledge of biblical languages to have attempted the project.&lt;ref&gt;In a 1954 court case, Franz was invited to translate a passage of Genesis from English to Hebrew. (Translator's proof, page 102-103). He declined, saying he would not attempt it. Heather and Gary Botting wrongly claim (page 98) he could make no sense of "an elementary passage of Hebrew from Genesis".&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Franz had studied Greek for two years and was self-taught in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=fred56&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 56| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much criticism of the NWT involves the rendering of certain texts considered to be biased towards specific Witness practices and doctrines.&lt;ref name="pentonbible" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Bowman Jr, ''Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses'', (Grand Rapids MI: Baker Book House, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haas,''Journal of Biblical Literature,'' Vol. 74, No. 4, (Dec. 1955), p. 283, "This work indicates a great deal of effort and thought as well as considerable scholarship, it is to be regretted that religious bias was allowed to colour many passages."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ankerberg&gt;Ankerberg, John and John Weldon, 2003, ''The New World Translation of the Jehovah's Witnesses'', accessible [http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/ATRI-Bible-School/Fall-Bible-School/fall-bible-school-jw-new-world-translation.htm online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029043702/http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/ATRI-Bible-School/Fall-Bible-School/fall-bible-school-jw-new-world-translation.htm |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes R, The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions, The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response, Zondervan, 2001, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M Metzger, "Jehovah's Witnesses and Jesus Christ," Theology Today, (April 1953 p. 74); see also Metzger, "The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures," The Bible Translator (July 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; These include the use of "torture stake" instead of "cross" throughout the New Testament;&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt; the rendering of [[John 1:1]], with the insertion of the indefinite article ("a") in its rendering to give "the Word was ''a'' god";&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Dodd: "The reason why [the Word was a god] is unacceptable is that it runs counter to the current of Johannine thought, and indeed of Christian thought as a whole." ''Technical Papers for The Bible Translator'', Vol 28, No. 1, January 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Romans 10:10, which uses the term "public declaration", which may reinforce the imperative to engage in public preaching;&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt; John 17:3, which used the term "taking in knowledge" rather than "know" to suggest that salvation is dependent on ongoing study,&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt; and the placement of the comma in Luke 23:43, which affects the timing of the fulfillment of Jesus' promise to the thief at [[Calvary]].&lt;ref name=bottingbible&gt;{{Citation| last = Botting| first = Heather| author2 = Gary Botting| title = The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1984| pages = 98–101| isbn = 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also criticized is the NWT's insertion of the name ''[[Jehovah]]'' 237 times in the [[New Testament]] without extant New Testament Greek manuscript evidence that the name existed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 494–505| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. HÉBERT/EDS, "Jehovah's Witnesses", ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia,'' Gale, 2005&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Vol. 7, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M., The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, The Bible Translator 15/3 (July 1964), pp. 150-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications have claimed that the name was "restored" on a sound basis, stating that when New Testament writers quote earlier Old Testament scriptures containing the [[Tetragrammaton]] (יהוה), "the translator has the right to render [[Kyrios]] ("LORD") as Jehovah."&lt;ref&gt;"God’s Name and the New Testament", ''The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1984, pages 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; The NWT mentions twenty-seven other translations which have similarly rendered ''Kyrios'' as a form of the name ''Jehovah'', stating that there is only one verse where the NWT does so without agreement from other translations.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix 1D The Divine Name in the Christian Greek Scriptures", ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures - With References'', page 1565&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society has claimed its translation "courageously restores God’s name, Jehovah, to its proper place in the Biblical text, is free from the bias of religious traditionalism, and ... gives the literal meaning of God’s Word as accurately as possible."&lt;ref&gt;"Your Bible—How It Was Produced", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1981, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason BeDuhn]], associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University, in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], compared major translations for accuracy. He stated that whilst there are "a handful of examples of bias in the [New World Translation (NW)]", that "most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers." He also wrote that the NWT's introduction of the name "Jehovah" into the New Testament 237 times was "not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;Jason D. BeDuhn, ''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'', 2004, pages 165, 169, 175, 176. BeDuhn compared the ''King James'', the ''(New) Revised Standard'', the ''New International'', the ''New American Bible'', the ''New American Standard Bible'', the ''Amplified Bible'', the ''Living Bible'', ''Today's English'' and the ''NWT'' versions in Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:6, Colossians 1:15-20, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58, John 1:1.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "the NW and [another translation] are not bias free, and they are not perfect translations. But they are remarkably good translations ... often better than [the other six translations analyzed]."&lt;ref&gt;''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'' by Jason BeDuhn, 2004, pages 165, University Press of America, {{ISBN|0-7618-2556-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-2556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticizes BeDuhn's positive review of the ''New World Translation'', stating that the main goal of BeDuhn's book is to deny the deity of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Howe, ''Bias in New Testament Translations?'', 2010, p. 326 (back cover), "In this critical evaluation, BeDuhn's arguments are challenged and his conclusions called into question." - See also Thomas A. Howe, ''The Deity of Christ in Modern Translations'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10766">A '''deathbed confession''' is an admittance or [[confession]] when someone is nearing death, or on their "death bed". This confession may help alleviate any [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[regret]]s, secrets, or [[sin]]s the dying person may have had in their life. These confessions can occur because the dying want to live the last moments of their life free of any secrets they have been holding in for a portion, or the entirety of their life. A deathbed confession can be given to anyone, but a family member is usually with their loved one during this time. Doctors and nurses may also hear a deathbed confession because they are often present in a person’s last moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Elizabeth Johnston|title=Religion: A Clinical Guide for Nurses|date=2012|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8261-0860-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These confessions can range from a confession of sins that have been committed to crimes that have been committed or witnessed. Often, these confessions are made to clear the dying’s conscience. A common type of confession is either religious or spiritually based. On the death bed, the dying will confess sins or mistakes they have made in their lifetime, and ask for forgiveness, so that they may move on to the [[afterlife]] according to their religion. Different religions have different protocols for the deathbed confession, but all religions seek to provide relief for the dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bregman|first1=Lucy|title=Death and Dying in World Religions |date=2009|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-0-7575-6838-1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; People may also confess their feelings for another person while dying. This can relieve the dying of the internal struggle with hiding how they actually feel for someone. These emotions can range from hatred to love, and everything in between.

Many confessions have involved the admittance of a crime that the dying has committed, which obviously cannot be prosecuted once the perpetrator has died. On the other hand, someone can confess that they have knowledge of or witnessed a crime that has been committed. This special kind of confession can sometimes be admissible in court to get a conviction, depending on the circumstances of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804 |website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=2011-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use for a deathbed confession in the criminal justice system is to re-open a case that may have gone cold to get [[closure (psychology)|closure]] for the victim's family or friends, even if prosecution is not an option.

== Religion ==

=== Buddhism ===
Many terminal patients look to religion or spirituality to bring comfort in their remaining time. [[Buddhism]] has been showing up in [[palliative care]] more frequently to help patients cope with death and come to peace with the end of their life. Buddhism is a philosophically based religion mainly focused on suffering: why it exists, what causes it, and how to escape it. The belief is that ignorance, anger, and attachment cause inevitable suffering to the body. Buddhism also believes that life and the body is temporary and it is a privilege used to look for [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Discussing any issues in a patient's life related to suffering can bring inner peace and relief. Buddhism does not seek to manipulate a dying patient into following a religion or forcing dying confessions, but rather to become a thought-provoking way to talk about their suffering and clear themselves of attachment to their body, to prepare for death. Talking about suffering may bring up confessions or secrets that can be released before death to journey towards enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masel|first1=Eva|last2=Watzke|first2=Herbert|last3=Schur|first3=Sophie|title=Life is Uncertain. Death is Certain. Buddhism and Palliative Care|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=August 2012 |volume=44 |issue=2|pages=307–312|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088539241200262X|accessdate=4 April 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2012.02.018|pmid=22871512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Many [[Christian]]s, most notably [[Catholics]], believe that sins must be [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] to a priest before death. The priest can then absolve the dying of their sins, so that they can be properly prepared for the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deathbed Confessions and Conversions|url=http://www.biblestudyguide.org/articles/death/deathbed-confessions-and-conversions.htm |website=Bible Study Guide|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admittance of sin is important to the dying individual, because this frees them from sin, purifying the soul for a happy afterlife with God in Heaven. These final confessions, sometimes along with the [[Last Rites]], are often performed by a hospital priest or [[chaplain]] when a patient's quality of life suddenly declines.

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] is largely centered around the idea of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Good karma allows the soul to move up on the incarnation hierarchy to a better life. Bad karma does the opposite; it causes the soul to have to pay for its actions in this life or the previous one. The next incarnation is less fortunate until the bad karma is cancelled out by good deeds or suffering. This heavy emphasis on karma leads many Hindus to carry out many final acts to improve their chances in the next life and reduce end of life suffering. The main ways Hindus try to increase their karma before moving onto the next life is by apologizing to people, resolving any issues with family or friends, confessions with a [[guru]] or other religious figure, religious ceremonies, sacrifices or repentance. Performing all, or some, of these actions allows the patient to think about God, while they pass and prepare for the next life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thrane|first1=Susan|title=Hindu End of Life: Death, Dying, Suffering, and Karma|journal=Journal of Hospice and Palliative Nursing|date=1 November 2010|volume=12|issue=6|pages=337–342|doi=10.1097/njh.0b013e3181f2ff11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Confession in Judaism#Deathbed confession}}
The [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;BT Shabbos 32a&lt;/ref&gt; teaches that "if one falls sick and his life is in danger, he is told: 'Make confession, for all who are sentenced to death make confession.'" [[Semahot|Masechet Semachot]]&lt;ref&gt;Semachot lit. means "Joyous Occasions" and is used euphemistically to refer to mourning. Semachot is one of the "Smaller Tractates" that records Amoraic and Tannaic statements that were not included in the canon of the Talmud&lt;/ref&gt; adds, &lt;blockquote&gt;"When someone is approaching death, we tell him to confess before he dies, adding that on the one hand, many people confessed and did not die, whilst on the other, there are many who did not confess and died, and there are many who walk in the street and confess; because on the merit of confession you will live."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Native American spirituality ===
Many tribes of Native Americans have similar views regarding death. Death is seen as a natural transition, and a part of life. The world is seen as an interconnected web, and a person is an extension of the web, as well as all other life. After death, it is believed by many that the components of your person is returned to the web of life. Making this transition smoothly is important to both the dying, and the loved ones left behind after they have passed on. Ensuring that there are no secrets remaining is vital to a transition back to the web of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Laurie|title=Workshop teaches Native American views on death, dying and spirituality|agency=The Advocate|date=17 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==

=== Admissibility ===
{{globalize|date=January 2018}}
A deathbed confession can be [[admissible evidence]] in court under the right circumstances. If someone confesses knowledge of a crime and then dies or their condition worsens, the law does not consider the statement to be [[hearsay]] and can be used in a criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deathbed confession can be a valuable piece of evidence in a case that may not have much [[physical evidence]]. Even criminal confessions that have been secret for years can still be of use, such as in a murder case, because there is no [[statute of limitations]] on murder cases.

=== Cold cases ===
Deathbed confessions can be used to re-open [[cold cases]] to benefit the victim's family. 

==Examples==
Bridget Sullivan, who had been employed as a housekeeper by the family of [[Lizzie Borden]],  died in [[Butte, Montana]] in 1948, where she allegedly gave a deathbed confession to her sister, stating that she had changed her testimony on the stand in order to protect Lizzie from being convicted of the murders of her father and step-mother.

===Alleged confessions===
Many decades after the 1926 disappearance of a 16-year-old girl named Emma Alice Smith in [[Sussex]], in  2009, a man named David Wright claimed his deceased great-aunt Lillian Smith, a sister of Emma Alice Smith, had told her niece that in the 1950s she had taken a death bed confession from a man claiming that he had murdered Emma Alice on her way to the train station in Horam. The case was reopened, not to find a killer, but to find the body of the young girl to give her a proper burial and give her relatives some closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Jonathan|title=Time and Crime: Which Cold-case Investigations Should Be Reheated?|journal=Criminal Justice Ethics|date=2015|volume=34|issue=1|pages=18–41|doi=10.1080/0731129x.2015.1025505|url=http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/344/1/Hughes%20%20Jonas_Time%20and%20Crime_accepted%20manuscript.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sussex Police concluded that despite the alleged death-bed confession, Emma Alice Smith had not been murdered but had in fact [[elope]]d with a married man named Thomas Wills. Police concluded the pair had probably ended up in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Johann Figl: ''Handbuch Religionswissenschaft: Religionen und ihre zentralen Themen.'' Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2003, {{ISBN|3-7022-2508-0}}, S. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia Haslinger: ''Die Evolution der Religionen und der Religiosität,'' s.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).  [http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf "Sociological Definitions, Language Games and the 'Essence' of Religion"]. ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'', vol 14, no. 1, pp. 61–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Jason Ānanda. (2012) ''The Invention of Religion in Japan.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0801887569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

'''Divine inspiration''' is the concept of a [[supernatural]] force, typically a [[deity]], causing a person or people to experience a [[Creativity|creative]] desire. It has been a commonly reported aspect of many [[religion]]s, for thousands of years. Divine inspiration is often closely tied to the concept of [[revelation]], the belief in information being revealed or disclosed through communication with a deity or other [[Non-physical entity|supernatural entity]] or entities.

==Examples==
Besides ancient mythology, the [[religious text]]s of traditions including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are all claimed to be divinely inspired to some degree.
* Ancient [[Mesopotamia]]: In the Mesopotamian epic ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'', the writer describes his work as dictated by the Goddess in a dream-vision.
* Ancient Greece: The [[Muse|ancient Greek muses]] were said to be supernatural forces that gave artists their skill, while the [[Oracle|Ancient Greek oracles]] were said to be subject to supernatural forces. 
* Hinduism: [[Music]] has historically been considered a medium through which performers can become a vehicle for divine inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Bruce M. |last=Sullivan|title =Historical Dictionary of Hinduism|date =1997|page= 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cvhGP8NRx4QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Scarecrow Press|isbn = 9780810833272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Saraswati]] is also sometimes invoked for assistance with inspiration.&lt;ref name=ar272&gt;{{Google books|IChFAAAAcAAJ|Asiatic Researches}}, - History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences and Literature of Asia, Volume 3, London, pages 272-273&lt;/ref&gt;
* Judaism and Christianity: Both religions claim [[Biblical inspiration]] for the parts of the [[Bible]] to which they adhere.
* Islam: Muslims believe the [[Quran]] was verbally revealed by God to [[Muhammad]] through the angel [[Gabriel]] (''Jibril''),&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Gray|title=The Leaders Are Coming!|date=2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=9781449760137|page=287|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sV0mAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22Muslims+believe+that+the+Quran+was+verbally+revealed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e8lCVMimDZS2yASeuYHgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Muslims%20believe%20that%20the%20Quran%20was%20verbally%20revealed%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams &amp; Drew"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy H.

==Counterexample==

The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have at times disclaimed divine inspiration with respect to their doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Do We Need Help to Understand the Bible? | journal= The Watchtower | date = February 15, 1981 | page = 19 | quote = "True, the brothers preparing these publications are not infallible. Their writings are not inspired as are those of Paul and the other Bible writers. (2 Tim. 3:16) And so, at times, it has been necessary, as understanding became clearer, to correct views. (Prov. 4:18)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at other times they propose that "divine guidance" is provided to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Do You See the Evidence of God's Guidance?", ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 2011, pages 3–5, "How, then, do we react when we receive divine direction? Do we try to apply it “right afterward”? Or do we continue doing things just as we have been accustomed to doing them? Are we familiar with up-to-date directions, such as those regarding conducting home Bible studies, preaching to foreign speaking people, regularly sharing in family worship, cooperating with Hospital Liaison Committees, and conducting ourselves properly at conventions? ... Do you clearly discern the evidence of divine guidance? Jehovah uses his organization to guide us, his people, through “the wilderness” during these last days of Satan’s wicked world."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plato's Manias==
[[Plato]] distinguishes four kinds of inspiration or "mania" in the dialogue [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]. The word "mania" signifying that a person is caught up in a state transcending the individual consciousness. In other dialogues, Plato identifies other manias besides the four given in Phaedrus. Anger, for example, is a mania because a man may become inspired by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in battle and perform deeds of superhuman strength. The four given in Phaedrus, however, are called Divine as they are the inspirations which perfect the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Shrine of Wisdom, "Plato and the Four Inspirations", in 3 parts, Vol 29 &amp; 30 (1926), Vol 31 (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Poetic or Musicial, inspired by [[The Muses]], brings the disordered parts of the soul into harmony.
# Telestic, inspired by [[Dionysus]], purifies the soul and returns it to its ideal state of perfection and wholeness.
# Prophetic, inspired by [[Apollo]], concentrates the soul to a unity.
# Amatory, inspired by [[Eros]], conjoins the unified soul to the gods and to intelligible Beauty, effecting divine union.

The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a highly [[sacred]] religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in particularly sacred ceremonies. They are made from bones of either the American [[bald eagle]] or the American [[golden eagle]], and are considered extremely powerful spiritual objects.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"&gt;Maroukis, Thomas Constantine (2005).

==Use==

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at  [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015 | format = PDF}} As amended 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

These laws would apply to the collection and use of eagle bone whistles.

'''''Ehi''''' is the name of a personal spirit in some West African religious beliefs, especially in southwestern [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]]. Ehi means "genius",&lt;ref name="JacobsNutt1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|last2=Nutt|first2=Alfred Trübner|last3=Wright|first3=Arthur Robinson|author4=Crooke, William |title=Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbq5AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 February 2013|year=1969|publisher=Folklore Society|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also means "angel" in some [[Nigerian languages]] and refers to a spirit possessing a man, similar to a [[guardian angel]].

''Ehi'' is a component of a person that remains with the supreme deity Osa. A person's ''ehi'' guides them through their life in the ''agbon'', or material world, while interacting with other spirits in the ''erinmwin'', or [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ehi'' is a component of a person that remains with the supreme deity Osa. A person's ''ehi'' guides them through their life in the ''agbon'', or material world, while interacting with other spirits in the ''erinmwin'', or spirit world.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''ehi'' remains with the person during the day, and returns to report to Osa at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary Of The Bini Language Of Southern Nigeria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3c9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=2013-02-05|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Ehi'' is viewed as a cult in parts of western Africa with a "moderated initiative" where many believe that lack of success can be blamed on the ''Ehi'' possessing a man.&lt;ref name="May1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=May|first=Brian|title=The Third World Calamity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TK89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=5 February 2013|year=1981|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-0764-3|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ehi'' is said to be "constantly sacrificed" in gratitude for success or for guidance in difficult times.&lt;ref name="Okpewho1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Okpewho|first=Isidore|title=Once Upon a Kingdom: Myth, Hegemony, and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DC-Q6vgEYTQC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=5 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21189-7|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury says of it, "Close as a man and his ''ehi'' are they are yet thought of as being independent agents and so there is a possibility of conflict between them. Ehi must, therefore, be propritiated in much the same way as other supernatural entities and failure to do this results in trouble.&lt;ref name="Okpewho1998"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4929">'''England's Happiness in the Crowning of William and Mary''' is an English [[broadside ballad]] composed in 1689 and takes as its primary focus the [[coronation]] of [[William III of England]] and [[Mary II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English Short Title Catalogue|title=Englands happiness in the crowning of VVilliam and Mary, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.

==Synopsis==
The ballad, set to the tune of "Let Caesar Live Long,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English Broadside Ballad Archive|title=ENGLANDS Happiness In the Crowning of WILLIAM and MARY, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20880/image|website=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrates the 1689 coronation of William III and Mary II of England. We see this adulation displayed most prominently in the ballad's refrain: "For in heart, voice, and loyalty merry we'll be, / In the Crowning of William and brave Queen Mary." Though there are variations of the [[refrain]] present in the ballad, each stanza concludes with the commemoration of the "Crowning of William and brave Queen Mary." The ballad celebrates also the subsequent abolition of [[Roman Catholicism]] that the crowning of the Protestant King and Queen was sure to bring about: "Now England, old England, still hold up thy head, / who lately by Popery long time hath been led, / [An]d let the Pope’s Actors, that plaid all their pranks, / [Be] gone in all haste, or we’l[l] cripple  their shanks." Indeed, one might say that a primary theme of this ballad, other than that of a straightforward [[encomium]], is [[anti-Catholicism]]. The stanzas are littered with pro-Protestant/anti-Catholic rhetoric. Indeed, the stanza ends by praising the reestablishment of the Protestant religion: "Then let all true Christians that lives in the lan[d] / By Protestant Interest for ever to stand, / And for good King William and Mary to pray, / In true Gospel-glory the Scepter to sway."

==Form==
The ballad is split into 10 six-line stanzas ([[sestet]]s), making the total line count 60. Each line is composed in [[iambic hexameter]], and the author uses rhyming [[couplets]] to tie these lines together.

'''Saint Fragan''' was a [[5th-century]] [[Pre-Congregational Saint]] and [[Prince]] of [[Scotland]].
He is celebrated on 3 October in the Calendar of the Breton Saints,&lt;ref name="grandterrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandterrier.net/wiki/index.php?title=Mod%C3%A8le:Almanak_Octobre|title=Modèle:Almanak octobre|website=GrandTerrier|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares with Gwen a [[Feast day]] on July 5 in the Roman Calendar.

Fragan came from Great Britain, and was a Prince of Albany in Scotland. In the 5th century he left Scotland to evangelize [[Armorica]].

{{other|Gemeinde (disambiguation)}}

In [[theology|theological usage]], the [[German language|German]] word '''Gemeinde''' ({{IPA|ɡəˈmaɪndə|lang}}; plural: '''Gemeinden''') refers to a group of people attached to a specific [[place of worship|house of worship]], usually a [[church (building)|church building]] or a [[synagogue]].
The word can be used to mean a parish assembly, in the sense of a group of people physically present for a service or other function, or be used in the sense of the [[Greek language|Greek]] term {{lang|he|[[koinonia]]}}, a general fellowship of believers.
In these senses, the word has no direct English equivalent except among [[Mormons]], who call it a ward.

Among the [[Amish]], the word can also refer to the Amish community, interpreted as a corporate body politic, as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hostetler | first=John Andrew | title=Amish Life | publisher=Herald Press | isbn=9780836133264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">'''Gerin oil''' or '''geriniol''' is a fictional drug used as a device to criticize [[religion]] in articles written by [[Richard Dawkins]]. The word is an [[anagram]] of "[[religion]]".

The first article, ''Gerin Oil'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html Gerin Oil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725123716/http://www.anst.uu.se/dla05000/Gerin%20Oil.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in an American [[secular humanism]] publication, ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', in December 2003 (Volume 24, No. 1).  It was popularised in an article titled ''Opiate of the Masses''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7036 Opiate of the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes a dangerous legal drug "Gerin Oil" or "Geriniol." Dawkins blames its effects as being responsible for historic acts of violence such as the [[September 11th attacks]], massacres of native South Americans by [[conquistadors]], and the [[Salem Witch Trials]].

In Dawkins' satirical description, users are often introduced to the "drug" at social gatherings such as weddings and funerals. In small amounts it is considered harmless, but its usage may increase over time. Medium usage of "Gerin Oil" is said to cause a disconnect with reality where users expect private wishes expressed to come true, and may be accompanied by spasmodic muscular movement or contraction. In large doses it is said to cause aural or visual hallucinations. He also links its use to child mutilation, sexual prohibition, and the tendency to smile when convicted of mass murder.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] included Dawkins' essay in his compilation ''[[The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Non-Believer|The Portable Atheist]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Great Big God''' is a Children's Christian music series from [[Vineyard Records UK]].

== History ==
In 2000, [[Nigel Hemming (Musician and Songwriter)|Nigel Hemming]] was approached by [[Vineyard Records UK]] to co-produce the first [[Vineyard Churches UK and Ireland|Vineyard UK]] children’s worship album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song entitled 'Great Big God', written by Nigel and Jo Hemming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://songselect.ccli.com/Songs/3373437/great-big-god|title=SongSelect by CCLI|website=songselect.ccli.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recorded and became the title track of the first album to be released under the brand ('''Great Big God''' – released in September 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following Easter, the song was chosen for use in the all age worship slot at [[Spring Harvest]], a national worship and teaching event in UK, and was featured on the live recording, ''Spring Harvest - Kids Praise 2002''.

Since the launch of the album in 2001 Great Big God as a series has grown and to date six albums, a DVD and three-disc best of compilation CD have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the series has been noted by many Christian music reviewers. For example, in February 2006 [[Cross Rhythms]] said that the "''Great Big God'' CDs have been amongst the most popular British-made children's worship albums of recent years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Backing_Tracks/13706/|title=Review: Backing Tracks - Great Big God {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Cross Rhythms again reiterated the popularity of the series saying "Great Big God CDs and DVDs...have been hugely popular with both parents and kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Great_Big_God_Live/77983/|title=Review: Great Big God Live - Great Big God - DVD {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|Adherent of Hinduism}}
'''Hindu''' ({{Audio|hi-Hindu.ogg|pronunciation}}) refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jefferylong&gt;[[Jeffery D. Long]] (2007), A Vision for Hinduism, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1845112738}}, pages 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion. (...) However, it is a religious term that the word ''Hindu'' is now used in English, and Hinduism is the name of a religion, although, as we have seen, we should beware of any false impression of uniformity that this might give us."&lt;/ref&gt; It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David N. Lorenzen|authorlink=David Lorenzen|title=Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO-YmMWpcVEC |year=2006| publisher=Yoda |isbn=978-81-902272-6-1|pages=xx, 2, 13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical meaning of the term ''Hindu'' has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the [[Indus]] in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in the [[Indian subcontinent]] around or beyond the Sindhu ([[Indus]]) river.&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan&gt;{{citation|last1=Hawley|first1=John Stratton|last2=Narayanan|first2=Vasudha|title=The Life of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hairjdT-ekC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, the term began to refer to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan/&gt;{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|p=6}} adds: "(...) 'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices. The '-ism' was added to Hindu in around 1830 to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans in contrast to other religions, and the term was soon appropriated by Indians themselves in the context of building a national identity opposed to colonialism, though the term 'Hindu' was used in Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographic texts in contrast to 'Yavana' or Muslim as early as the sixteenth century".}}{{Efn|{{harvtxt|von Stietencron|2005|p=229}}: For more than 100 years the word Hindu (plural) continued to denote the Indians in general. But when, from AD 712 onwards, Muslims began to settle permanently in the Indus valley and to make converts among low-caste Hindus, Persian authors distinguished between Hindus and Muslims in India: Hindus were Indians other than Muslim. We know that Persian scholars were able to distinguish a number of religions among the Hindus. But when Europeans started to use the term Hindoo, they applied it to the non-Muslim masses of India without those scholarly differentiations.}}

The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenzenhidentity&gt;{{harvnb|Lorenzen|2006|pp=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it developed post-8th century CE after the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars.&lt;ref name=lorenzenhidentity/&gt;&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt;&lt;ref name=brajadulal/&gt; A sense of Hindu identity and the term ''Hindu'' appears in some texts dated between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and regional languages.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt;&lt;ref name="OConnell1973"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Word 'Hindu' in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Texts |author=O'Connell, Joseph T. |date=July–September 1973| journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=340–344 |doi=10.2307/599467 |jstor=599467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as [[Vidyapati]], [[Kabir]] and [[Eknath]] used the phrase ''Hindu dharma'' (Hinduism) and contrasted it with ''Turaka dharma'' (Islam).{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006}} The Christian friar Sebastiao Manrique used the term 'Hindu' in religious context in 1649.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=15}} In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer to the followers of [[Indian religions]] collectively as ''Hindus'', in contrast to ''Mohamedans'' for Mughals and Arabs following Islam.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;&lt;ref name=hawleynarayanan/&gt; By the mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains,&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; but the colonial laws continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term ''Hindu'' until about mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=rachel/&gt; Scholars state that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon.&lt;ref name=lipner17/&gt;&lt;ref name=leslie/&gt; '''Hindoo''' is an archaic spelling variant, whose use today may be considered derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Herbst|first=Philip|title=The color of words: an encyclopaedic dictionary of ethnic bias in the United States|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=1997|isbn=978-1-877864-97-1|pp=106–107|quote= "'''Hindu, Hindoo'''  A term borrowed from the Persian word ''Hindu'' ...

&lt;!-- Omitted for now
Despite the commonplace use of the term "Hindu" for the followers of the Hindu religion, the term also continues to designate a cultural identity, the ownership of India's millennia-old cultural heritage. [[Arvind Sharma]] notes that the exclusivist conception of religion was foreign to India, and Indians did not yield to it during the centuries of Muslim rule but only under the British colonial rule. Resistance to the exclusivist conception led to [[Savarkar]]'s ''Hindutva'', where Hinduism was seen both as a religion and a culture.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=25-26}} ''Hindutva'' is a national Hindu-ness, by which a Hindu is one born in India and behaves like a Hindu. [[M. S. Golwalkar]] even spoke of "Hindu Muslims," meaning "Hindu by culture, Muslim by religion."{{sfn|Sridharan|2000|pp=13-14}}

{{further information|Hinduism}}
The word ''Hindu'' is derived from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}} and [[Sanskrit]]{{sfn|Flood|2008|p=3}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} word ''Sindhu'', which means "a large body of water", covering "river, ocean".&lt;ref name="TakacsCline2015"&gt;{{citation |last1=Takacs |first1=Sarolta Anna |last2=Cline |first2=Eric H. |title=The Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |date=17 July 2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-45839-5 |pages=377–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{harvtxt|Flood|2008|p=3}}: The Indo-Aryan word ''Sindhu'' means "river", "ocean".}} It was used as the name of the [[Indus river]] and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term '{{not a typo|hindu}}' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as "a [[Persian language|Persian]] geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: ''Sindhu'')",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of [[Darius I]].&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/&gt; The [[Punjab region]], called [[Sapta Sindhu]] in the Vedas, is called ''Hapta Hindu'' in [[Zend Avesta]].

Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text ''Record of the Western Regions'' by the Buddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]]. Xuanzang uses the transliterated term ''In-tu'' whose "connotation overflows in the religious" according to [[Arvind Sharma]].&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/&gt; While Xuanzang suggested that the term refers to the country named after the moon, another Buddhist scholar [[I-tsing]] contradicted the conclusion saying that ''In-tu'' was not a common name for the country.{{sfn|Jha|2009|p=15}}

[[Al-Biruni]]'s 11th-century text ''Tarikh Al-Hind'', and the texts of the Delhi Sultanate period use the term 'Hindu', where it includes all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists, and retains the ambiguity of being "a region or a religion".&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/&gt; The 'Hindu' community occurs as the amorphous 'Other' of the Muslim community in the court chronicles, according to [[Romila Thapar]].&lt;ref name="Thapar tyranny"&gt;{{citation |last=Thapar |first=Romila |authorlink=Romila Thapar |date=September–October 1996 |title=The Tyranny of Labels |journal=Social Scientist |volume=24 |number=9/10 |pp=3–23 |JSTOR=3520140 |doi=10.2307/3520140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] notes that 'Hindu' retained its geographical reference initially: 'Indian', 'indigenous, local', virtually 'native'. Slowly, the Indian groups themselves started using the term, differentiating themselves and their "traditional ways" from those of the invaders.{{sfn|Wilfred Cantwell Smith|1981|p=62}}

&lt;!-- Do we still need this?
'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}}
--&gt;
The text ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', by Chanda Baradai, about the 1192 CE defeat of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] at the hands of [[Muhammad Ghori]], is full of references to "Hindus" and "Turks", and at one stage, says "both the religions have drawn their curved swords;" however, the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} In Islamic literature, [[Isami (historian)|'Abd al-Malik Isami]]'s Persian work, ''Futuhu's-salatin'', composed in the Deccan in 1350, uses the word ''{{'}}{{not a typo|hindi}}' '' to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word ''{{'}}{{not a typo|hindu}}' '' to mean 'Hindu' in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion".{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} The poet [[Vidyapati]]'s poem ''Kirtilata'' contrasts the cultures of Hindus and Turks (Muslims) in a city and concludes "The Hindus and the Turks live close together; Each makes fun of the other's religion (''dhamme'')."{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=31}} One of the earliest uses of word 'Hindu' in religious context in a European language (Spanish), was the publication in 1649 by Sebastiao Manrique.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=15}}

Other prominent mentions of 'Hindu' include the epigraphical inscriptions from Andhra Pradesh kingdoms who battled military expansion of Muslim dynasties in the 14th century, where the word 'Hindu' partly implies a religious identity in contrast to 'Turks' or Islamic religious identity.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|pp=32-33}} The term ''Hindu'' was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later [[Rajatarangini]]s of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450) and some 16th- to 18th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] texts, including ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' and ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]''. These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called [[Yona#Later meanings|Yavanas]] (foreigners) or [[Mlecchas]] (barbarians), with the 16th-century ''Chaitanya Charitamrita'' text and the 17th-century ''Bhakta Mala'' text using the phrase "Hindu [[dharma]]".&lt;ref name="OConnell1973" /&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Malviya dwipa island across Har ki Pauri during Kavad mela, Haridwar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Hindus at [[Har Ki Pauri]], [[Haridwar]] near river [[Ganges]] in [[Uttarakhand]] state of India.]]

===Medieval-era usage (8th to 18th century)===
One of the earliest but ambiguous uses of the word Hindu is, states [[Arvind Sharma]], in the 'Brahmanabad settlement' which Muhammad ibn Qasim made with non-Muslims after the Arab invasion of northwestern Sindh region of India, in 712 CE. The term 'Hindu' meant people who were non-Muslims, and it included Buddhists of the region.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th-century text of Al Biruni, Hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to Islam, as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between Hindus holding a centralist and pluralist religious views.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2/&gt; In the texts of Delhi Sultanate era, states Sharma, the term Hindu remains ambiguous on whether it means people of a region or religion, giving the example of Ibn Battuta's explanation of the name "Hindu Kush" for a mountain range in Afghanistan. It was so called, wrote Ibn Battuta, because many Indian slaves died there of snow cold, as they were marched across that mountain range. The term ''Hindu'' there is ambivalent and could mean geographical region or religion.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism, and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Hindu appears in the texts from the Mughal Empire era. It broadly refers to non-Muslims. Pashaura Singh states, "in Persian writings, Sikhs were regarded as Hindu in the sense of non-Muslim Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), page 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahangir]], for example, called the Sikh [[Guru Arjan]] a Hindu:&lt;ref&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.gisp.d7_sp/files/sitefiles/journals/volume12/no1/3_singh.pdf Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan], Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=
There was a Hindu named Arjan in Gobindwal on the banks of the Beas River. Pretending to be a spiritual guide, he had won over as devotees many simple-minded Indians and even some ignorant, stupid Muslims by broadcasting his claims to be a saint. [...] When Khusraw stopped at his residence, [Arjan] came out and had an interview with [Khusraw]. Giving him some elementary spiritual precepts picked up here and there, he made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called qashqa in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky.

During the colonial era, the term Hindu had connotations of native religions of India, that is religions other than Christianity and Islam.&lt;ref name=gauri&gt;Gauri Viswanathan (1998), Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691058993}}, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; In early colonial era Anglo-Hindu laws and British India court system, the term Hindu referred to people of all Indian religions and two non-Indian religions:

{{Quote|
The colonial project was itself undermined by its own constitutive contradictions since many of these laws were no more intrinsic to Indian society than the proposed meld of English and Indian systems. (...) The application of laws derived from Sanskrit classical texts leveled the community of '''Hindus''' to include all those who were not Muslims or Christians, and it absorbed under the category of "Hindu" both outcastes and members of religions as diverse as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism.
|Gauri Viswanathan, ''Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief''|&lt;ref name=gauri/&gt;}}

The 20th-century colonial laws of British India segregated people's rights by their religion, evolving to provide Muslims with Sharia law, Christians, Jews and Parsis of British India with their own religious laws. The British government created a compendium of religious laws for Hindus, and the term 'Hindu' in these colonial 'Hindu laws', decades before India's independence, applied to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.&lt;ref name=rachel&gt;Rachel Sturman (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Timothy Lubin et al), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521716260}}, pages 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the stipulations of British law, colonial [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] and particularly the influential Asiatick Researches founded in the 18th century, later called [[The Asiatic Society]], initially identified just two religions in India – Islam, and Hinduism. These orientalists included all Indian religions such as Buddhism as a subgroup of Hinduism in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111-118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These texts called followers of Islam as ''Mohamedans'', and all others as ''Hindus''. The text, by the early 19th century, began dividing Hindus into separate groups, for chronology studies of the various beliefs. Among the earliest terms to emerge were ''Seeks and their College'' (later spelled Sikhs by Charles Wilkins), ''Boudhism'' (later spelled Buddhism), and in the 9th volume of Asiatick Researches report on religions in India, the term ''Jainism'' received notice.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;

According to Pennington, the terms Hindu and Hinduism were thus constructed for colonial studies of India. The various sub-divisions and separation of subgroup terms were assumed to be result of "communal conflict", and Hindu was constructed by these orientalists to imply people who adhered to "ancient default oppressive religious substratum of India", states Pennington.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; Followers of other Indian religions so identified were later referred Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains and distinguished from Hindus, in an antagonistic two-dimensional manner, with Hindus and Hinduism stereotyped as irrational traditional and others as rational reform religions. However, these mid-19th-century reports offered no indication of doctrinal or ritual differences between Hindu and Buddhist, or other newly constructed religious identities.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt; These colonial studies, states Pennigton, "puzzled endlessly about the Hindus and intensely scrutinized them, but did not interrogate and avoided reporting the practices and religion of Mughal and Arabs in South Asia", and often relied on Muslim scholars to characterise Hindus.&lt;ref name=brian111/&gt;

===Contemporary usage===

:When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or [[creed]]. It may broadly be described as a [[way of life]] and nothing more.

===Disputes===

In the [[Constitution of India]], the word "Hindu" has been used in some places to denote persons professing any of these religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr3indi.htm India-Constitution:Religious rights] Article 25:''"Explanation II: In sub-Clause (b) of clause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion"''&lt;/ref&gt; This however has been challenged by the Sikhs&lt;ref name="Marty1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin E.

The [[Republic of India]] is in the peculiar situation that the [[Supreme Court of India]] has repeatedly been called upon to define "Hinduism" because the [[Constitution of India]], while it prohibits "discrimination of any citizen" on grounds of religion in article 15, article 30 foresees special rights for "All minorities, whether based on religion or language". As a consequence, religious groups have an interest in being recognised as distinct from the Hindu majority in order to qualify as a "religious minority". Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether [[Jainism]] is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006.

==History of Hindu identity==
Starting after the 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion, states Sheldon Pollock, the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri&gt;Sheldon Pollock (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 266-269&lt;/ref&gt; Temples dedicated to deity [[Rama]] were built from north to south India, and textual records as well as hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] to regional kings and their response to Islamic attacks. The [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] king of [[Devagiri]] named ''[[Ramachandra of Devagiri|Ramacandra]]'', for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, "How is this Rama to be described.. who freed [[Varanasi]] from the ''mleccha'' (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara".&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt; Pollock notes that the Yadava king ''Ramacandra'' is described as a devotee of deity [[Shiva]] (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom's location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity [[Vishnu]] avatar.&lt;ref name=pollockdevagiri/&gt; Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 261-297&lt;/ref&gt;

Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence.&lt;ref name=brajadulal2004/&gt; According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom ([[Karnataka]]), and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature.&lt;ref name=brajadulal&gt;Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (1998), Representing the other?: Sanskrit sources and the Muslims (eighth to fourteenth century), Manohar Publications, {{ISBN|978-8173042522}}, pages 92-103, Chapter 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brajadulal2004&gt;Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, {{ISBN|978-0761825616}}, pages 303-323&lt;/ref&gt; This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards. The 14th-century Sanskrit text, ''Madhuravijayam'', a memoir written by ''Gangadevi'', the wife of Vijayanagara prince, for example describes the consequences of war using religious terms,&lt;ref name=brajadulal306/&gt;

I very much lament for what happened to the groves in Madhura,

Although al-Biruni's original Arabic text only uses a term equivalent to the religion of the people of India, his description of Hindu religion is in fact remarkably similar to those of nineteenth-century European orientalists. For his part Vidyapati, in his Apabhransha text Kirtilata, makes use of the phrase 'Hindu and Turk dharmas' in a clearly religious sense and highlights the local conflicts between the two communities. In the early sixteenth century texts attributed to Kabir, the references to 'Hindus' and to 'Turks' or 'Muslims' (musalamans) in a clearly religious context are numerous and unambiguous."&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (2010), Rethinking Religion in India: The Colonial Construction of Hinduism (Editors: Esther Bloch et al), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548908}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andrew Nicholson, in his review of scholarship on Hindu identity history, states that the vernacular literature of [[Bhakti movement]] sants from 15th to 17th century, such as [[Kabir]], Anantadas, Eknath, Vidyapati, suggests that distinct religious identities, between Hindus and Turks (Muslims), had formed during these centuries.&lt;ref name=andrewnicholson/&gt; The poetry of this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities, states Nicholson, and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with a "distinct sense of a Hindu religious identity".&lt;ref name=andrewnicholson&gt;Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 198-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars state that Hindu, Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectively-introduced modern constructions.&lt;ref name=leslie/&gt; Inscriptional evidence from the 8th century onwards, in regions such as South India, suggests that medieval era India, at both elite and folk religious practices level, likely had a "shared religious culture",&lt;ref name=leslie&gt;Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195356724}}, pages 25-26, 204&lt;/ref&gt; and their collective identities were "multiple, layered and fuzzy".&lt;ref name=leslieorr&gt;Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195356724}}, pages 42, 204&lt;/ref&gt; Even among Hinduism denominations such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Hindu identities, states Leslie Orr, lacked "firm definitions and clear boundaries".&lt;ref name=leslieorr/&gt;

Overlaps in Jain-Hindu identities have included Jains worshipping Hindu deities, intermarriages between Jains and Hindus, and medieval era Jain temples featuring Hindu religious icons and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415266055}}, pages 6-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K Reddy (2011), Indian History, Tata McGraw Hill, {{ISBN|978-0071329231}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Allen (1992), Ornament in Indian Architecture, University of Delaware Press, {{ISBN|978-0874133998}}, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond India, on Java island of [[Indonesia]], historical records attest to marriages between Hindus and Buddhists, medieval era temple architecture and sculptures that simultaneously incorporate Hindu and Buddhist themes,&lt;ref&gt;Trudy King et al (1996), Historic Places: Asia and Oceania, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1884964046}}, page 692&lt;/ref&gt; where Hinduism and Buddhism merged and functioned as "two separate paths within one overall system", according to Ann Kenney and other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Kenney et al (2003), Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824827793}}, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among ''Khatris'', were frequent.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner/&gt; Some Hindu families brought up a son as a Sikh, and some Hindus view Sikhism as a tradition within Hinduism, even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.&lt;ref name=robertzaehner&gt;Robert Zaehner (1997), Encyclopedia of the World's Religions, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0760707128}}, page 409&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Lipner states that the custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs is a modern phenomena, but one that is a convenient abstraction.&lt;ref name=lipner17&gt;Julius J. Lipner (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415456777}}, pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing Indian traditions is a fairly recent practice, states Lipner, and is the result of "not only Western preconceptions about the nature of religion in general and of religion in India in particular, but also with the political awareness that has arisen in India" in its people and a result of Western influence during its colonial history.&lt;ref name=lipner17/&gt;

===Sacred geography===
Scholars such as Fleming and Eck state that the post-Epic era literature from the 1st millennium CE amply demonstrate that there was a historic concept of the Indian subcontinent as a sacred geography, where the sacredness was a shared set of religious ideas. For example, the twelve ''Jyotirlingas'' of Shaivism and fifty-one ''Shaktipithas'' of Shaktism are described in the early medieval era Puranas as pilgrimage sites around a theme.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knut A.

Varanasi as a sacred pilgrimage site is documented in the ''Varanasimahatmya'' text embedded inside the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', and the oldest versions of this text are dated to 6th to 8th-century CE.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|p=56}}&lt;ref name=Eck2012p34/&gt;

The idea of twelve sacred sites in Shiva Hindu tradition spread across the Indian subcontinent appears not only in the medieval era temples but also in copper plate inscriptions and temple seals discovered in different sites.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=57-58}} According to Bhardwaj, non-Hindu texts such as the memoirs of Chinese Buddhist and Persian Muslim travellers attest to the existence and significance of the pilgrimage to sacred geography among Hindus by later 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surinder M. Bhardwaj|title=Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India: A Study in Cultural Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6XJFokSJzEC |year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04951-2|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fleming, those who question whether the term Hindu and Hinduism are a modern construction in a religious context present their arguments based on some texts that have survived into the modern era, either of Islamic courts or of literature published by Western missionaries or colonial-era Indologists aiming for a reasonable construction of history. However, the existence of non-textual evidence such as cave temples separated by thousands of kilometers, as well as lists of medieval era pilgrimage sites, is evidence of a shared sacred geography and existence of a community that was self-aware of shared religious premises and landscape.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-58}}&lt;ref name=Eck2012p34/&gt; Further, it is a norm in evolving cultures that there is a gap between the "lived and historical realities" of a religious tradition and the emergence of related "textual authorities".{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=57-58}} The tradition and temples likely existed well before the medieval era Hindu manuscripts appeared that describe them and the sacred geography. This, states Fleming, is apparent given the sophistication of the architecture and the sacred sites along with the variance in the versions of the Puranic literature.{{sfn|Fleming|2009|pp=51-58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surinder M.

Eck]] and other Indologists such as André Wink, Muslim invaders were aware of Hindu sacred geography such as Mathura, Ujjain, and Varanasi by the 11th-century. These sites became a target of their serial attacks in the centuries that followed.&lt;ref name=Eck2012p34&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana L Eck|authorlink=Diana L.

===Hindu nationalism===
{{main article|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Christophe Jaffrelot states that modern Hindu nationalism was born in [[Maharashtra]], in the 1920s, as a reaction to the Islamic [[Khilafat Movement]] wherein Indian Muslims championed and took the cause of the Turkish Ottoman sultan as the Caliph of all Muslims, at the end of the [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=chrisjaffrelot/&gt;&lt;ref name=minault&gt;Gail Minault (1982), The Khilafat Movement: Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231050722}}, pages 1-11 and Preface section&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of Indian Muslim population, of pan-Islamic hegemony, and questioned whether Indian Muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial Indian nationalism.&lt;ref name=minault/&gt; The Hindu nationalism ideology that emerged, states Jeffrelot, was codified by Savarkar while he was a political prisoner of the British colonial empire.&lt;ref name=chrisjaffrelot&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691130989}}, pages 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amalendu Misra (2004), Identity and Religion, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761932260}}, pages 148-188&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Bayly traces the roots of Hindu nationalism to the Hindu identity and political independence achieved by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]], that overthrew the Islamic Mughal empire in large parts of India, allowing Hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored Hindu holy places such as Varanasi.&lt;ref&gt;CA Bayly (1985), The pre-history of communialism? Religious conflict in India 1700-1860, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2, pages 186-187, 177-203&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars view Hindu mobilisation and consequent nationalism to have emerged in the 19th century as a response to [[British colonialism]] by Indian nationalists and [[neo-Hinduism]] gurus.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691130989}}, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Copley]] (2000), Gurus and their followers: New religious reform movements in Colonial India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195649581}}, pages 4-5, 24-27, 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Hardy&gt;Hardy, F.

The colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was primarily a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism.&lt;ref name=peterveer/&gt; The successes of each side fed the fears of the other, leading to the growth of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=peterveer&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 11-14, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as "an Islamic state" upon independence.&lt;ref name=peterveer31&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 31, 99, 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jawad Syed|author2=Edwina Pio|author3=Tahir Kamran et al|title=Faith-Based Violence and Deobandi Militancy in Pakistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mx5DQAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-94966-3|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farahnaz Ispahani|title=Purifying the Land of the Pure: A History of Pakistan's Religious Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jl7ODQAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-062167-4|pages=28–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India.&lt;ref name=peterveer53&gt;Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520082564}}, pages 26-32, 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of [[Hindutva]] in second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = RamPrasad&gt;Ram-Prasad, C.

Gerald Larson states, for example, that Hindu nationalists have sought a uniform civil code, where all citizens are subject to the same laws, everyone has equal civil rights, and individual rights do not depend on the individual's religion.&lt;ref name=larson55&gt;GJ Larson (2002), Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0253214805}}, pages 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, opponents of Hindu nationalists remark that eliminating religious law from India poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of Muslims, and people of Islamic faith have a constitutional right to Islamic [[sharia]]h-based personal laws.&lt;ref name=larson55/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield (2005), The Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code?, in Religion and Law in Independent India (Editor: Robert Baird), Manohar, {{ISBN|978-8173045882}}, page 121-127, 135-136, 151-156&lt;/ref&gt; A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls.&lt;ref name=sylviavatuk/&gt; Hindu nationalists seek that the legal age for marriage be eighteen that is universally applied to all girls regardless of their religion and that marriages be registered with local government to verify the age of marriage. Muslim clerics consider this proposal as unacceptable because under the shariah-derived personal law, a Muslim girl can be married at any age after she reaches puberty.&lt;ref name=sylviavatuk&gt;Sylvia Vatuk (2013), Adjudicating Family Law in Muslim Courts (Editor: Elisa Giunchi), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415811859}}, pages 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu nationalism in India, states Katharine Adeney, is a controversial political subject, with no consensus about what it means or implies in terms of the form of government and religious rights of the minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Adeney and Lawrence Saez (2005), Coalition Politics and Hindu Nationalism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415359818}}, pages 98-114&lt;/ref&gt;

In more ancient times, Hindu kingdoms arose and spread the religion and traditions across Southeast Asia, particularly [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref name="Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia"&gt;{{cite web| URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=P4uJMJNpvdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia|publisher=Hunter Publisher.Inc|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia"/&gt; [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ITLRpPrrcykC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_vpt_buy#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Philippine History Module-based Learning I' 2002 Ed.|publisher=Rex Bookstore.Inc|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what is now central [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Iv3B4moBF_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Traces of Indian Culture in Vietnam|author=Gitesh Sharma|publisher=Rajkamal Prakshan Group|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 3 million Hindus are found in [[Bali]] Indonesia, a culture whose origins trace back to ideas brought by Tamil Hindu traders to Indonesian islands in the 1st millennium CE. Their sacred texts are also the [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700715336}}, pages 2-23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Purana]]s and the [[Itihasa]] (mainly ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'') are enduring traditions among Indonesian Hindus, expressed in community dances and shadow puppet (''[[wayang]]'') performances. As in India, Indonesian Hindus recognises four paths of spirituality, calling it ''Catur Marga''.&lt;ref name=murdana&gt;Murdana, I. Ketut (2008), BALINESE ARTS AND CULTURE: A flash understanding of Concept and Behavior, Mudra - JURNAL SENI BUDAYA, Indonesia; Volume 22, page 5-11&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindu believe that there are four proper goals of human life, calling it ''Catur Purusartha'' - [[dharma]] (pursuit of moral and ethical living), [[artha]] (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), [[kama]] (pursuit of joy and love) and [[moksha]] (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bagus Sudirga (2009), Widya Dharma - Agama Hindu, Ganeca Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9795711773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IGP Sugandhi (2005), Seni (Rupa) Bali Hindu Dalam Perspektif Epistemologi Brahma Widya, Ornamen, Vol 2, Number 1, pp. 58-69&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''historiography of religion''' is how historians have studied religion in terms of themes, sources and conflicting ideas. Historians typically focus on one particular topic in the overall [[history of religions]] - in terms of geographical area or of theological tradition.

Historians for centuries focused on the theological developments of their own religious heritage. Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in "primitive" and comparative religion. In the 20th century the field focused mostly on theology and on church organization and development. Since the 1970s the [[social history]] approach to religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformation==
{{Further|Reformation|Protestant culture}}
Jacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation.  Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the sixteenth century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli.  Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the [[social history|new social history]] in the 1960s look at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, "in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991) p 215&lt;/ref&gt;
==1700-1900==
New approaches to the history of Christianity were introduced by [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795-1886) and [[Philip Schaff]]  (1819-92). They emphasized the need for more neutrality, with the goal of understanding history as it actually happened, rather than promoting or defending ones theological heritage. Von Ranke in 1843 finished his six‐volume ''German History in the Epoch of the Reformation'' then turned to a multivolume '' History of the Popes during the Last Four Centuries.''  Schaff, deeply schooled in the German tradition, relocated to the United States in 1844. His ''History of the Christian Church'' (7 vols., 1858–1890), set new standards for the American study of ecclesiastical history. He demonstrated how to integrate liturgical developments.  He also introduced European scholars to American religion, arguing that American sectarianism, with all its faults, was preferable to European church-statism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Albert Howard, "Philip Schaff: Religion, Politics and the Transatlantic World." ''Journal of Church &amp; State'' 49#2 (2007): 191-210. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Pietism and benevolence===
[[Pietism]], originated in 18th century Germany and was emulated in neighboring countries. It had a major impact in England and North America, where it affected the [[Methodist]] movement and a series of revival outbursts known as the [[Great Awakening]] in the U.S.  It involved an intense internal focus on sin and salvation through Christ, and in the form of [[evangelicalism]], remains a powerful force in Protestantism into the 21st century.  Pietism emphasize the value of revivals, leading to the born-again experience, and inspired its followers to set high moralistic standards for public behavior, as in such areas as opposition to alcohol and slavery.&lt;ref&gt; Jonathan Strom,  "Problems and promises of pietism research." ''Church History'' 71.3 (2002): 536-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have explored in depth the impact of the new religious sentiments of the 18th and 19th century on the organizational behavior of laymen.  The  Protestants sponsored voluntary charitable and religious societies, including overseas missions throughout the empire, setting up Sunday Schools, founding charity schools, distributing Bibles and devotional literature, creating and emphasizing hymns and communal singing, and setting up revivals.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Sirota, ''The Christian Monitors: The Church of England and the Age of Benevolence, 1680-1730'' (2014) &lt;/ref&gt; A major result was the establishment of an international battle against slavery as an affront to Protestant morality.&lt;ref&gt;  Travis Glasson, ''Mastering Christianity: Missionary Anglicanism and Slavery in the Atlantic World'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative studies===
Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and "primitive" religion through the work of [[Max Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[William Robertson Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Émile  Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Rudolf Otto]].&lt;ref&gt; Hans Kippenberg, ''Discovering Religious History in the Modern Age'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Hartmut Lehmann argues that four basic themes dominated the history of Christianity during the 20th century:  the rise of "political religions," drastic technological changes, progressive secularization, and the impressive growth of Christian communities in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Lehmann,  "The history of twentieth-century christianity as a challenge for historians." ''Church history'' 71.3 (2002): 585-599. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Secularization===
An important field of study has been secularization, or the steady decline in religious activity in historically Protestant countries of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Morris, "Secularization and religious experience: arguments in the historiography of modern British religion." ''Historical Journal'' 55#1 (2012): 195-219, [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/secularization-and-religious-experience-arguments-in-the-historiography-of-modern-british-religion/2912CE04BABEEB79361D41DE5E06E08E online]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Brown, ''The death of Christian Britain: understanding secularisation'' (2nd ed. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missions and expansion===
Much recent research is focused on the dramatic expansion of Christian religions in the Third World.  &lt;ref&gt; 
David B. Barrett, et al. eds. ''World Christian Encyclopedia: A Comparative Survey of Churches and Religions in the Modern World, vol. 1, The World by Countries: Religionists, Churches, Ministries; vol. 2: The World by Segments: Religions, Peoples, Languages, Cities, Topics'' (2nd ed. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
Protestant and Catholic religions, starting with the base in colonial powers in Europe , grew dramatically in the Third World in the 20th century, especially in Africa.  For example, there are a far more Anglicans in Nigeria today, that in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wingate and Carrie Pemberton, eds. ''Anglicanism: a global communion'' (Church Publishing, Inc., 1998).  &lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries especially from the United States promoted Mormon, Jehovah Witness, Seventh-day Adventist, and holiness and Pentecostal denominations to highly receptive audiences.&lt;ref&gt;André Corten,  "The growth of the literature on Afro‐American, Latin American and African Pentecostalism." ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'' 12.3 (1997): 311-334. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
The historiography of Islam grew slowly in the 20th century, and since the 1980s has become a major project for scholars.  &lt;ref&gt;Aziz Al-Azmeh, ed. ''Times of History: Universal Topics in Islamic Historiography'' (2007) [https://muse.jhu.edu/book/40498 online] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology''''', published in 1877, is a book of [[esoteric]] [[philosophy]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]'s first major work and a key text in her [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical movement]]. 

The work has often been criticized as a plagiarized occult work, with scholars noting how Blavatsky extensively copied from a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. Hart|Hart, James D]]; Leininger, Phillip. (1995). ''The Oxford Companion to American Literature''. Oxford University Press. pp. 71-72. {{ISBN|0-19-506548-4}} "After a period of spiritualism in America, Mme Blavatsky with the aid of Colonel Henry S. Olcott founded her Theosophical Society and published ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877), a plagiarized occult work denouncing the spiritualism she had formerly advocated."&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Isis Unveiled'' is nevertheless also understood by modern scholars to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. (1994). ''The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge''. State University of New York Press. pp. xv-x-x, 241-245. "The Western Esoteric Tradition has no more important figures in modern times than Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;Godwin, Joscelyn. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevir"&gt;Bevir, Mark. ''The West Turns Eastward: Madame Blavatsky and the Transformation of the Occult Tradition''. Journal of the American Academy of Religion. 62.3 (1994), pp. 747-767.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna'', in ''Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism''. ed. by Wouter J. Hanegraff (Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The work was originally entitled ''The Veil of Isis'', a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 [[Rosicrucian]] work by W.W. Reade. ''Isis Unveiled'' is divided into two volumes. Volume I, ''The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science'', discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, [[elementals]], [[psychic phenomena]], and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, ''Theology'', discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to [[Eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], the [[Vedas]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. It follows the [[Renaissance]] notion of ''[[prisca theologia]]'', in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient "Wisdom-Religion".&lt;ref name="Santucci"/&gt; Blavatsky writes in the preface that ''Isis Unveiled'' is "a plea for the recognition of the [[Hermetic philosophy]], the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena P., ''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology'' (Pasadena, CA: Theosophical University Press, 1999), vol. I. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Isis Unveiled'' is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction'' (Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition—[[perennial philosophy]], a [[Neo-Platonic]] [[Emanationism|emanationist cosmology]], [[adepts]], [[esoteric Christianity]]—and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, ''Isis Unveiled'' reflected many contemporary controversies—such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories on [[evolution]] and their impact on religion—and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Bruce F. ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 34-38, 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.

In later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in ''Isis Unveiled'' appeared in a significantly altered form,{{refn|group=note|name="conceptual shift in move to india"|This shift in thought is marked by Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society's move eastward to India.&lt;ref name="WEMS"&gt;''Helena Blavatsky: Western Esoteric Masters Series'', ed. by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2004), pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}} drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction.  Specifically, the few and—according to many—ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of ''Isis Unveiled'' stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888).  Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in ''Isis Unveiled'', attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in ''Isis Unveiled'' compared to those of later works.{{refn|group=note|name="HPBs elaboration on reincarnation in IU"|In the article ''Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits'' Blavatsky elaborately addressed the confusion related to the statements on reincarnation of ''Isis Unveiled'', stating in particular that: "[… T]he doctrine [of reincarnation] is maintained now as it was then.  Moreover, there is no 'discrepancy' but only incompleteness — hence, misconceptions arising from later teachings.".&lt;ref name=trs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits|journal=Articles from The Path — April 1886 to March 1896 |date=November 1886|volume= I|issue= 8|page=232|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/path/v01n08p232_theories-about-reincarnation-and-spirits.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|name="HPB on three- and sevenfold conception of man"|In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' Blavatsky explains that the sevenfold conception of man is the threefold conception of man, refined.  In section 6, ''Theosophical Teachings as to Nature and Man'', under the heading ''The Septenary Nature of Man'' it is asked: "Is it what we call Spirit and Soul, and the man of flesh?", to which is replied: "It is not. That is the old Platonic division. Plato was an Initiate, and therefore could not go into forbidden details; but he who is acquainted with the archaic doctrine finds the seven in Plato's various combinations of Soul and Spirit.".&lt;ref name=keytotheosophy&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=The Key to Theosophy|orig-year=1889|publisher= Theosophical University Press: Online Literature|isbn=1-55700-046-8|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern Theosophists hold the book as a [[Revelation|revealed]] [[Religious text|work]] dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's [[Ascended master|Masters]].&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ‘The Coming of the Masters: The Evolutionary Reformulation of Spiritual Intermediaries in Modern Theosophy’, in ''Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western Esotericism'', ed.

==Critical reception==
[[File:Emmette Coleman.png|thumb|[[William Emmette Coleman]]]]
Detractors often accuse the book of extensive unattributed [[plagiarism]], a view first seriously put forth by [[William Emmette Coleman]] shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as [[Mark Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Sedgwick|Sedgwick, Mark]]. (2004). ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|0-19-515297-2}} "''Isis Unveiled'' was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's ''Sod, the Son of Man'', 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's ''History of Magic'', and so on)."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Geoffrey Ashe]] notes that ''Isis Unveiled'' combines "comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a mélange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]]. (2001). ''Encyclopedia of Prophecy''. ABC-CLIO. p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Isis Unveiled'' makes use of a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: "Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas."&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Modern copies of ''Isis Unveiled'' are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.

Historian [[Ronald H. Fritze]] considers ''Isis Unveiled'' to be a work of [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009). ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions''. Reaktion Books. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Henry R. Evans]], a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a "hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry R. Evans|Evans, Henry R]]. (1897). ''Hours with the Ghosts, or, Nineteenth Century Witchcraft: Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Theosophy''. Laird &amp; Lee. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing ''Isis Unveiled'' and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time.&lt;ref name="Olcott"&gt;Olcott, Henry. ''Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, I'' (Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1972), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci 2"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''The Notion of Race in Theosophy'', in ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 11.3 (2008), pp. 37-63&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and [[Occultism]] as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding [[Spiritualism]] movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later [[Ascended master|Masters]], rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals—who helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her—under a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"/&gt;

[[Sten Bodvar Liljegren]] notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing [[orientalism]] of the period, the novels of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, A. L. (1958). ''Through a Glass Darkly: Spiritualism in the Browning Circle by Katherine H. Porter; Bulwer-Lytton's Novels and "Isis Unveiled" by S. B. Liljegren''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 2, No. 2. pp. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judaism}}

'''Judaism''' (originally from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|יהודה}}, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]";&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford" /&gt; via [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) is the religion of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. It is an ancient, [[monotheistic]], [[Abrahamic religion]] with the [[Torah]] as its foundational text.&lt;ref name="uncertainties" /&gt; It encompasses the [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[culture]] of the [[Jewish people]].&lt;ref name="Judaism" /&gt; Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] that [[God in Judaism|God]] established with the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Knowledge Resources: Judaism" /&gt; Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Hebrew Bible]], and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. With between 14.5 and 17.4&amp;nbsp;million adherents worldwide,&lt;ref name="Population of Jews" /&gt; Judaism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the tenth largest religion in the world]].

Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]].&lt;ref name="What is the oral Torah?" /&gt; Historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the [[Sadducees#General|Sadducees]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism]] during the [[Second Temple period]]; the [[Karaite Judaism#Karaite interpretations of the Torah|Karaites]] and [[Sabbateans]] during the early and later medieval period;&lt;ref name="Karaite Jewish University" /&gt; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] may be [[nontheistic]].&lt;ref name="Society for Humanistic Judaism" /&gt; Today, the largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]]. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to [[Jewish law]], the authority of the [[Rabbinic tradition]], and the significance of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Denominations" /&gt; Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more [[Religious liberalism|liberal]], with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews.&lt;ref name="Reform Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Reform Judaism?" /&gt; Historically, [[beth din|special courts]] enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary.&lt;ref name="Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din" /&gt; Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the [[rabbis]] and scholars who interpret them.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;

The [[history of Judaism]] spans more than 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="MINDELL2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David P Mindell|title=The Evolving World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8kA6eaz7hsC&amp;pg=PA224|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04108-0|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism has its roots as an [[organized religion]] in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/history_1.shtml|title=History of Judaism until 164 BCE|work=History of Judaism|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions.&lt;ref name="Religion &amp; Ethics – Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/themes/religion/ Religion: Three Religions, One God] PBS&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrews]] and [[Israelites]] were already referred to as "Jews" in later books of the Tanakh such as the [[Book of Esther]], with the term Jews replacing the title "Children of Israel".&lt;ref name="google" /&gt; Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later [[Abrahamic religions]], including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref name="Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: Theological and Historical Affiliations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Historical Muhammad" /&gt; Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced [[secular]] [[Western world|Western]] [[ethics]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref name="questia" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} [[Hebraism]] was just as important a factor in the ancient era development of [[Western civilization]] as [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenism]], and Judaism, as the background of [[Christianity]], has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Historical Series"&gt;Cambridge University Historical Series, ''An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects'', p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews are an [[ethnoreligious group]]&lt;ref name="Ethnoreligious" /&gt; including those born Jewish, in addition to [[converts to Judaism]]. In 2015, the [[Jewish population by country|world Jewish population]] was estimated at about 14.3&amp;nbsp;million, or roughly 0.2% of the total world population.&lt;ref name=WJP2015&gt;{{cite web|title=World Jewish Population 2015|url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Studies/details.cfm?StudyID=803|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 43% of all Jews reside in [[Israel]] and another 43% reside in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with most of the remainder living in [[Europe]], and other minority groups spread throughout [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="WJP2015" /&gt;

Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created.&lt;ref name="understanding" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt; According to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), God promised [[Abraham]] to make of his offspring a great nation.&lt;ref name="everlasting" /&gt; Many generations later, he commanded the nation of [[Israelites|Israel]] to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world.&lt;ref name="deuteronomy" /&gt; He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.&lt;ref name="leviticus" /&gt; These commandments are but two of a large corpus of [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] and [[Halakha|laws]] that constitute this [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], which is the substance of Judaism.

Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism ([[Kabbalah]]), Rabbinic scholar [[Max Kadushin]] has characterized normative Judaism as "normal mysticism", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews.&lt;ref name="publishing" /&gt; This is played out through the observance of the [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) and given verbal expression in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Birkat Ha-Mizvot]], the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled.
:The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the ''Berakhot''. ''Kedushah'', holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The ''Birkat Ha-Mitzwot'' evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are [[Theurgy|non-theurgic.]] And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a ''Berakah'' is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the ''occasions'' for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.&lt;ref name="publishing2" /&gt;
Whereas [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] often debate whether God is [[Immanence|immanent]] or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, [[Halakha]] is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.

Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Jewish Bible ([[Tanakh]]) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in [[ancient Israel]].&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre" /&gt; In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.&lt;ref name="The Jewish roots of Christological monotheism: papers from the St. Andrews conference on the historical origins of the worship of Jesus" /&gt;

Moreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283487502_Is_There_a_Jewish_Theology_or_Not|title=Is There a Jewish Theology or Not?|last=Maimes|first=Steven|date=Jan 2013|website=|language=en|via=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/must-a-jew-believe-in-god/|title=Must a Jew Believe in God?|last=Septimus|first=Daniel|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=Nov 19, 2018|publisher=70 / Faces Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God ''per se''.&lt;ref name="jovanovich" /&gt; In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history.&lt;ref name="movements" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/community/st-tammany/index.ssf/2014/01/theology_on_tap_winter_2014_un.html|title=Theology on Tap Winter 2014 under way in Mandeville: Keeping the Faith|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Normative Judaism?

Scholars throughout [[Jewish history]] have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism.&lt;ref name="montpelier" /&gt; The most popular formulation is [[Maimonides]]' [[13 principles of faith|thirteen principles of faith]], developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic.&lt;ref name="mesora" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, 13 Principles of Faith" /&gt; Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The JPS guide to Jewish traditions" /&gt;

In Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. Albo and [[Abraham ben David|the Raavad]] argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith.

Along these lines, the ancient historian [[Josephus]] emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating [[apostasy]] with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included [[circumcision]] and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries.&lt;ref name="medieval" /&gt; Later, two poetic restatements of these principles ("''[[Ani Ma'amin]]''" and "''[[Yigdal]]''") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies,&lt;ref name="The Thirteen Principles of the Jewish Faith" /&gt; leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.&lt;ref name="What Do Jews Believe?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;

In modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judaism101beliefs" /&gt; Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Even so, all [[Jewish religious movements]] are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and various commentaries such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarch]] [[Abraham]] as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to [[Moses]], who is considered Judaism's greatest [[prophet]].&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ontario" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patriarchscovenant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Do You Know the Exodus Really Happened?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sacredtexts" /&gt; In the [[Mishnah]], a core text of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the [[World to Come]].&lt;ref name="sacred-texts" /&gt;

Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]]. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik's]] (associated with the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox movement]]) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the [[halakha]] whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of the [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with [[civilization]] and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, [[Solomon Schechter]]'s [[Conservative Judaism]] was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, [[David Philipson]] draws the outlines of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/15006583/Some_Remarks_on_the_Self-Images_of_the_Modern_Judaism._Textual_Analysis|title=Some Remarks on the Self-Images of the Modern Judaism.

===Jewish legal literature===
{{Main article|Halakha}}
The basis of Jewish law and tradition (halakha) is the [[Torah]] (also known as the [[Pentateuch]] or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]] in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]] (members of the tribe of [[Levi]]), some only to farmers within the [[Land of Israel]]. Many laws were only applicable when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/541686/jewish/How-Many-of-the-Torahs-Commandments-Still-Apply.htm|title=How Many of the Torah's Commandments Still Apply?|last=Danzinger|first=Eliezer|website=Chabad.org|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the [[Sadducees]], and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]), most Jews believe in the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]. These oral traditions were transmitted by the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.

According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.

For centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146" (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''[[Mishnah]]'' was compiled by Rabbi [[Judah the Prince|Judah haNasi]] after the destruction of Jerusalem, in [[anno mundi]] 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew) (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two [[Talmud]]s, the Jerusalem Talmud (''Talmud Yerushalmi'') and the Babylonian Talmud (''Talmud Bavli''). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.

In the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm|title=Proofs for the Oral Law|last=Student|first=Gil|date=|website=The AishDas Society|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic [[Midrash]], the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as [[responsa]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Sheelot U-Teshuvot''.) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

===Jewish philosophy===
{{Main article|Jewish philosophy}}
Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Judah Halevi]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]]. Major changes occurred in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], and [[Yitzchok Hutner]]. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Will Herberg]], and [[Emmanuel Lévinas]].

===Rabbinic hermeneutics===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=13 Principles of Hermeneutics:

# A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form
# A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms.
# A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served.
# When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars, only those particulars are to be embraced by it.
# A law that begins with specifying particular cases, and then proceeds to an all-embracing generalization, is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization.
# A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications, then continues with the specification of particular cases, and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization, can be applied only to the particular cases specified.
# The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars (rules 4 and 5) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language.
# A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization.
# A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited, but without any mention of the penalty.
# A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case, normally included in the generalization, with a modification in the penalty, either toward easing it or making it more severe.
# A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them.
# Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages
# Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages.

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and many other [[Jews]] do not believe that the revealed [[Torah]] consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of [[Torah]] (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Talmud]]) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the [[Talmud]],
:These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).
In Judaism, "the study of [[Torah]] can be a means of experiencing God".&lt;ref name="publishing3" /&gt; Reflecting on the contribution of the [[Amoraim]] and [[Tanaim]] to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:
:The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world .... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification."&lt;ref name="invitation" /&gt;
To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study ''how'' to study the word of God.

In the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various [[logic]]al and [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:
:first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy" /&gt;
These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud,
:A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire—declares the Lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings." (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).
Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations&lt;ref name="indeterminacy4" /&gt;

According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the [[written Torah]] were revealed to Moses at Sinai in [[oral Torah|oral form]], and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy5" /&gt;

Thus, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]); [[R. Ishmael]], thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel).&lt;ref name="introduction" /&gt; [[Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili]] listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet ha-Shachar'', the introduction to his commentary on the [[Sifra]]. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to [[logic]], [[hermeneutics]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="introduction6" /&gt; [[Judah Hadassi]] incorporated Ishmael's principles into [[Karaite Judaism]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="introduction7" /&gt; Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="jerusalem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="congregations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publications" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publication" /&gt;

==Jewish identity==
===Origin of the term "Judaism"===
[[File:Macedonian Mezuzah.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mezuzah]] case]]

The term "Judaism" derives from ''Iudaismus'', a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek ''[[Ioudaismos]]'' (Ἰουδαϊσμός) (from the verb {{lang|grc|ἰουδαΐζειν}}, "to side with or imitate the [Judeans]").&lt;ref name="LSJverb"&gt;{{LSJ|*)ioudai/zw|ἰουδαΐζειν|ref|mLSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ultimate source was the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] יהודה, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]",&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford8" /&gt; which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism: יַהֲדוּת, ''Yahadut''. The term ''Ἰουδαϊσμός'' first appears in the [[Hellenistic Greek]] book of [[2 Maccabees]] in the 2nd century BCE. In the context of the age and period it meant "seeking or forming part of a cultural entity"&lt;ref name=influence /&gt; and it resembled its antonym ''[[hellenismos]]'', a word that signified a people's submission to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) cultural norms. The conflict between ''iudaismos'' and ''hellenismos'' lay behind the [[Maccabean revolt]] and hence the invention of the term ''iudaismos''.&lt;ref name=influence&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2q6qTb-A7GwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA39 |first=Oskar |last=Skarsaune |authorlink=Oskar Skarsaune | title=In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity|publisher=InterVarsity Press|pages=39ff. |accessdate=22 August 2010|isbn=978-0-8308-2670-4|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] writes in his book ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'':

{{quote|We are tempted, of course, to translate [''Ioudaïsmós''] as "Judaism," but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, ''Ioudaïsmós'' has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion. It means rather "the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish)." Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call "religious," but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus ''Ioudaïsmós'' should be translated not as "Judaism" but as Judaeanness.&lt;ref&gt;Shaye J.D. Cohen 1999 ''The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties'' University of California Press. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean "the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews" is Robert Fabyan's ''The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce'' (1516).&lt;ref&gt;"He anon renouncyd his Iudaisme or Moysen Lawe, And was cristenyd, and lyued after as a Cristen Man." (Robert Fabian, ''New Chronicles of England and France'', reprint London 1811, p. 334.)&lt;/ref&gt; "Judaism" as a direct translation of the Latin ''Iudaismus'' first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] ([[Deuterocanon]] in [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]), 2 Macc. ii. 21: "Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme."&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism===
According to [[Daniel Boyarin]], the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in [[Plato]]nic philosophy and that permeated [[Hellenistic Judaism]].&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity" /&gt; Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see [[Haskalah]]) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the [[Land of Israel]]. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the [[Khazar]]s), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.{{citation needed | reason= Boyarin does not say anything about Khazars is this synthesis?|date=April 2015}} Thus, Boyarin has argued that "Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension."&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10" /&gt;

In contrast to this point of view, practices such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.

===Who is a Jew?===
{{Main article|Who is a Jew?}}

According to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in accordance with Jewish Law. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and the larger denominations of worldwide [[Reform Judaism|Progressive Judaism]] (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Who is a Jew?" /&gt; Converts are called "ben Abraham" or "bat Abraham", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel G. Freedman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/strains-grow-between-israel-and-many-jews-in-the-us.html "Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew,&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university" /&gt; and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes.&lt;ref name="Law of Return 5710-1950" /&gt; However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism "without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community" and "A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jacob, Walter (1987). Contemporary American Reform Responsa. Mars, PA: Publishers Choice Book Mfg." /&gt;

[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, [[David Ben-Gurion]] requested opinions on ''mihu Yehudi'' ("Who is a Jew") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.&lt;ref name="Klein2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish demographics===
{{Main|Jewish population by country}}

The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of "who is a Jew" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the ''Jewish Year Book'' (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6&amp;nbsp;million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.

==Jewish religious movements==
{{Main article|Jewish religious movements}}

===Rabbinic Judaism===
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: "Yahadut Rabanit" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the [[Talmud]]. It is characterised by the belief that the [[Written Torah]] (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the [[Oral Torah]] and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the [[halakha|Law]].

The [[Jewish Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century resulted in the division of [[Ashkenazi]] (Western) Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.
* [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that both the Written and [[Oral Torah]] were divinely revealed to [[Moses]] and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law. Orthodoxy places a high importance on [[13 Principles of Faith|Maimonides' 13 principles]] as a definition of Jewish faith.
:* Orthodoxy is often divided into [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]]. [[Haredi Judaism]] is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of [[Haredi Judaism]] include [[Hasidic Judaism]], which is rooted in the [[Kabbalah]] and distinguished by reliance on a [[Rebbe]] or religious teacher; and [[Sephardic Haredi]] Judaism, which emerged among [[Sephardic]] (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel.
* [[Conservative Judaism]] is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [[Shabbat]] and [[kashrut]], a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses.&lt;ref name="Torah MiSinai:Conservative Views" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservative Judaism" /&gt; Conservative Judaism holds that the [[oral Torah|Oral Law]] is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.
* [[Reform Judaism]], called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the [[Torah]] while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.
[[File:ReformJewishService.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|right|A [[Reform Judaism|Reform synagogue]] with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women]]

* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.
* [[Jewish Renewal]] is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.
* [[Humanistic Judaism]] is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.

While [[Minhag|traditions and customs]] (see also "[[Sephardic law and customs]]") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the "movement" framework popular in and among [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elazar|first1=Daniel|title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed?|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm|website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a "big tent" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jager|first1=Elliot|title=Sephardi Judaism Straining to Stay Non-Denominational|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Sephardi-Judaism-Straining-to-Stay-Non-Denominational-513181|website=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case in contemporary [[State of israel|Israel]], which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) 

Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and [[Nusach#Sephardi_and_Mizrachi_nuschaot|prayer rites]] are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

====Jewish movements in Israel====
{{Main article|Religion in Israel}}
Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as "secular" (''hiloni''), [[Masortim|"traditional" (''masorti'')]], "religious" (''dati'') or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]''. The term "secular" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).

The term "traditional" (''masorti'') is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of "eastern" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the [[Conservative Judaism]], which also names itself "Masorti" outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways "secular" and "traditional" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term "Orthodox" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]]. What would be called "Orthodox" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' (religious) or ''haredi'' (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called "[[Religious Zionism]]" or the "National Religious" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''haredi-leumi'' ([[nationalism|nationalist]] ''haredi''), or "Hardal", which combines a largely ''haredi'' lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in [[Yiddish]], also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as ''frum'', as opposed to ''frei'' (more liberal Jews)).

''Haredi'' applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) "Lithuanian" (non-hasidic) ''haredim'' of [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic]] origin; (2) Hasidic ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] ''haredim''.

===Karaites and Samaritans===
[[Karaite Judaism]] defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [[Second Temple]] period, such as the [[Sadducees]]. The Karaites ("Scripturalists") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the [[Peshat]] ("simple" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.

The [[Samaritan]]s, a very small community located entirely around [[Mount Gerizim]] in the [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]] region of the [[West Bank]] and in [[Holon]], near [[Tel Aviv]] in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]]. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written [[Torah]] (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]]).

===Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)===
''See also: [[Haymanot]]; [[Beta Israel]].''

Haymanot (meaning "religion" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like [[Sigd]].

==Jewish observances==
===Jewish ethics===
{{Main article|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be guided by [[halakhic]] traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness ([[chesed]]), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity ([[tzedakah]]) and refraining from negative speech ([[lashon hara]]). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.

===Prayers===
{{Main article|Jewish services}}
[[File:YemeniJew1914.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a [[kippah]] skullcap, prayer shawl and [[tefillin]]]]
Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with a fourth prayer, [[Mussaf]] added on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holidays]]. At the heart of each service is the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esrei''. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (or ''Shema''). The ''Shema'' is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4): ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad''—"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!"

Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a [[quorum]] of ten adult Jews, called a ''[[minyan]]''. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a ''minyan''; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.

In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|prayers and benedictions]] throughout the day when [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Everyday prayers and blessings|performing various acts]]. Prayers are recited upon [[Modeh ani|waking up in the morning]], before eating or drinking different foods, [[Birkat Hamazon|after eating a meal]], and so on.

The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an [[Egalitarianism|equal basis]] with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as [[Torah reading|reading from the Torah]]. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

===Religious clothing===
{{Further|kippah|tzitzit|tefillin}}
A ''[[kippah]]'' (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural ''kippot''; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, ''yarmulke'') is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. ''Kippot'' range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.

''[[Tzitzit]]'' (Hebrew: צִיציִת) ([[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''tzitzis'') are special knotted "fringes" or "tassels" found on the four corners of the ''[[tallit]]'' (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: ''tallis''), or prayer [[shawl]]. The ''tallit'' is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A ''tallit katan'' (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.

[[Tefillin]] (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning ''safeguard'' or ''amulet''), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

A ''[[kittel]]'' (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the [[High Holidays]]. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a ''tallit'' and sometimes also a ''kittel'' which are part of the ''[[tachrichim]]'' (burial garments).

===Jewish holidays===
{{Main article|Jewish holiday}}
Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as [[Creation myth|creation]], [[revelation]], and [[salvation|redemption]].

====Shabbat====
{{Main article|Shabbat}}

[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Two braided Shabbat [[challah]]s placed under an embroidered [[challah cover]] at the start of the Shabbat meal]]
''[[Shabbat]]'', the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.&lt;ref name="shabbat" /&gt; It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have [[challah]], two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of ''melakhah'']], translated literally as "work". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not "work" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.

====Three pilgrimage festivals====
{{Main article|Shalosh regalim}}

[[File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Some [[sukkah|sukkot]] in Jerusalem]]
Jewish holy days (''chaggim''), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called "regalim" (derived from the Hebrew word "regel", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.
* [[Passover]] (''Pesach'') is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [[Passover Seder|Seder]]. [[leavening agent|Leavened]] products ([[chametz]]) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [[Matzo]] is eaten instead of bread.
* [[Shavuot]] ("Pentecost" or "Feast of Weeks") celebrates the revelation of the [[Torah]] to the [[Israelite]]s on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.
* [[Sukkot]] ("Tabernacles" or "The Festival of Booths") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called ''sukkot'' (sing. ''[[sukkah]]'') that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in ''sukkot'' for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [[Shemini Atzeret]], where Jews begin to pray for rain and [[Simchat Torah]], "Rejoicing of the Torah", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.

====High Holy Days====
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Yom Kippur]]'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1878)]]
{{Main article|High Holidays}}
The High Holidays (''Yamim Noraim'' or "Days of Awe") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.
* [[Rosh Hashanah]], (also ''Yom Ha-Zikkaron'' or "Day of Remembrance", and ''Yom Teruah'', or "Day of the Sounding of the [[Shofar]]"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, "head of the year"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tishri]]. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.
* [[Yom Kippur]], ("Day of Atonement") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a "Machzor". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the "seuda mafseket", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called "Ne'ilah", ends with a long blast of the shofar.

====Purim====
{{Main article|Purim}}
[[File:Jerusalem Purim street scene.jpg|right|thumb|Purim street scene in Jerusalem]]
[[File:Présentation de la Loi, Edouard Moyse (1860) - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Torah]] reading, France, 1860 [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
[[Purim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Audio|He-Purim.ogg|פורים}} ''Pûrîm'' "[[Cleromancy|lots]]") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the [[Persian Jews]] from the plot of the evil [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], who sought to [[genocide|exterminate]] them, as recorded in the biblical [[Book of Esther]]. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, [[Alms|charity]] to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called [[hamantash]]en, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.

Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]], which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.

====Hanukkah====
{{Main article|Hanukkah}}

[[Hanukkah]] ({{lang-he|חֲנֻכָּה}}, "dedication") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] ([[Hebrew calendar]]). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.

The holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning "dedication") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the "Miracle of the Oil". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days – which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.

Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.

====Fast days====
{{Main article|Tisha B'Av|Seventeenth of Tamuz|10th of Tevet|Tzom Gedaliah}}
[[Tisha B'Av]] ({{lang-he|תשעה באב}} or {{lang|he|ט׳ באב}}, "the Ninth of [[Av (month)|Av]]") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, and in later times, the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]].

There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the [[Seventeenth of Tamuz|17th Tamuz]], the [[10th of Tevet]] and [[Tzom Gedaliah]] (the 3rd of Tishrei).

====Israeli holidays====
{{Main article|Yom Hashoah|Yom Hazikaron|Yom Ha'atzmaut}}
The modern holidays of [[Yom Ha-shoah]] (Holocaust Remembrance Day), [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Israeli Memorial Day) and [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]] (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the [[Holocaust]], the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.

There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the [[Tenth of Tevet#Day of general kaddish|10th of Tevet]].

===Torah readings===
{{Main article|Torah reading}}
The core of festival and [[Shabbat]] prayer services is the public reading of the [[Torah]], along with connected readings from the other books of the [[Tanakh]], called [[Haftarah]]. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on [[Simchat Torah]].

===Synagogues and religious buildings===
{{Main article|Synagogue}}
[[File:Belz World Center Inside.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the [[Belz Great Synagogue]] in Jerusalem.]]

Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:
* The [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] (called ''aron ha-kodesh'' by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and ''hekhal'' by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) where the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (''[[parochet]]'') outside or inside the ark doors);
* The elevated reader's platform (called ''[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]'' by Ashkenazim and ''tebah'' by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);
* The [[sanctuary lamp|eternal light]] (''ner tamid''), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]
* The pulpit, or ''amud'', a lectern facing the Ark where the [[hazzan]] or prayer leader stands while praying.

In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include [[yeshiva]]s, or institutions of Jewish learning, and [[mikvah]]s, which are ritual baths.

===Dietary laws: ''kashrut''===
{{Main article|Kashrut}}

The Jewish dietary laws are known as ''[[kashrut]]''. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed [[kosher foods|kosher]], and food that is not kosher is also known as ''treifah'' or ''treif''. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be "keeping kosher".&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Many of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, [[mammals]] must have split [[hooves]] and [[ruminants|chew their cud]]. The [[pig]] is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal.&lt;ref name="The Kosher Pig?" /&gt; Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud.&lt;ref name="Tamar Levy, St. Louis, MO – Block Yeshiva High School, Grade 9" /&gt; For [[seafood]] to be kosher, the animal must have [[fins]] and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Certain types of seafood, such as [[shellfish]], [[crustaceans]], and [[eel]]s, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the [[Torah]]. The exact [[translations]] of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, [[traditions]] exist about the ''kashrut'' status of a few birds. For example, both [[chickens]] and [[turkeys]] are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], and most [[insects]], are prohibited altogether.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as ''[[shechitah]]''. Without the proper [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]] practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered ''treif''. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the [[blood]], some [[fat]]s, and the area in and around the [[sciatic nerve]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Jewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Talmud]] and [[Rabbinic law]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of ''kashrut'', but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.&lt;ref name="shulchan" /&gt;

The use of [[Dishware|dishes]], serving utensils, and [[oven]]s may make food ''treif'' that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food ''treif'' under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Furthermore, all [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and some [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] authorities forbid the consumption of processed [[grape]] products made by non-Jews, due to ancient [[pagan]] practices of using wine in rituals.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.&lt;ref name="rabbinicalassembly" /&gt;

The [[Torah]] does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of ''kashrut''.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing [[cruelty to animals]] and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Kashrut Facts" /&gt; The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained.&lt;ref name="Judaism 101: Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws" /&gt; In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because "they are unclean".&lt;ref name="leviticus11" /&gt; The [[Kabbalah]] describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.&lt;ref name="Judaism and the Art of Eating" /&gt;

Survival concerns supersede all the laws of ''kashrut'', as they do for most [[halakha|halakhot]].&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biu" /&gt;

===Laws of ritual purity===
{{Main article|Tumah}}
[[File:Шабатна кибритна кутија - Shabbat matchbox holder.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A silver matchbox holder for ritual use on [[Shabbat]] with inscription in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]]]
The [[Tanakh]] describes circumstances in which a person who is ''tahor'' or ritually pure may become ''tamei'' or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human [[corpses]] or [[grave (burial)|graves]], seminal flux, vaginal flux, [[menstruation]], and contact with people who have become impure from any of these.&lt;ref name="leviticus15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bamidbar" /&gt; In Rabbinic Judaism, [[Kohanim]], members of the hereditary [[caste]] that served as [[priests]] in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies.&lt;ref name="Torah tidbits" /&gt; During the Temple period, such priests ([[Kohanim]]) were required to eat their bread offering ([[Terumah]]) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as [[Handwashing in Judaism|hand-washing]] which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.

====Family purity====
[[File:Fauteuil de circoncision ("Fauteuil d'Elie").jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|18th-century circumcision chair [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
{{Main article|Niddah}}

An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating [[women]]. These laws are also known as ''[[niddah]]'', literally "separation", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.&lt;ref name="koshersex" /&gt;

Especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]], the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the [[Torah]] mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from [[sexual intercourse]] for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped.&lt;ref name=leviticus15 /&gt; The Rabbis conflated ordinary ''niddah'' with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as ''[[zavah]]'', and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her [[husband]] from the time she begins her [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual]] flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, [[Rabbinical law]] forbids the [[husband]] from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a [[mikveh]].&lt;ref name=koshersex /&gt;

Traditional [[Ethiopian Jews]] keep menstruating women in separate [[huts]] and, similar to [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite practice]], do not allow menstruating women into their [[temples]] because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to [[Israel]] and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.&lt;ref name="Karaites" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women and water: menstruation in Jewish life and law" /&gt;

===Life-cycle events===
Life-cycle events, or [[rites of passage]], occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community.
* [[Brit milah]]&amp;nbsp;– Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [[circumcision]] on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named ''[[zeved habat]]'' or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.
* [[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah]]&amp;nbsp;– This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a "portion" of the Torah.
* [[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]]&amp;nbsp;– Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a ''[[chuppah]]'', or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.
* [[bereavement in Judaism|Death and Mourning]]&amp;nbsp;– Judaism has a multi-staged [[mourning]] practice. The first stage is called the [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] (literally "seven", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the ''shloshim'' (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, ''avelut yud bet chodesh'', which is observed for eleven months.

[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand.jpg|thumb|Jewish students with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]] c. 1910.]]
The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [[Third Temple]] and need to remain in readiness for future duty.
* [[Kohen]] (priest) – patrilineal descendant of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. In the Temple, the ''kohanim'' were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [[Priestly Blessing]], as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
* Levi ([[Levite]]) – Patrilineal descendant of [[Levi]] the son of [[Jacob]]. In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the levites sang [[Psalms]], performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

===Prayer leaders===
From the time of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the [[Torah]] and ''haftarah'' (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a ''[[minyan]]'', the presence of ten Jews.

The most common professional clergy in a [[synagogue]] are:
* [[Rabbi]] of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as ''shatz'' or ''baal kriyah'' (see below).
** Hassidic ''[[Rebbe]]'' – rabbi who is the head of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty.
* [[Hazzan]] (note: the "h" denotes [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as ''shatz''. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.

Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:
* Shaliach tzibur or ''Shatz'' (leader—literally "agent" or "representative"—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a ''shatz'' recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is ''not'' acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying ''amen'' at their conclusion; it is with this act that the ''shatz's'' prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as ''shatz''. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all [[Progressive Judaism|Progressive]] communities now allow women to serve in this function.
* The Baal kriyah or ''baal koreh'' (master of the reading) reads the weekly [[Torah]] portion. The requirements for being the ''baal kriyah'' are the same as those for the ''shatz''. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.

Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:
* [[Gabbai]] (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the ''shatz'' for each prayer session if there is no standard ''shatz'', and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.

The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as ''shatz'' and ''baal kriyah'', and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.

===Specialized religious roles===
* ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|Dayan]]'' (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.
* [[Mohel]] (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified ''mohel'' and performs the ''[[brit milah]]'' (circumcision).
* [[shechita|Shochet]] (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a ''shochet'' who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another ''shochet.''
* [[Sofer (scribe)|Sofer]] (scribe) – [[Torah]] scrolls, ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'' (scrolls put on doorposts), and ''gittin'' (bills of divorce) must be written by a ''sofer'' who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
* [[Rosh yeshiva]] – A Torah scholar who runs a [[yeshiva]].
* [[Mashgiach ruchani|Mashgiach]] of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on [[Mussar movement|mussar]] (Jewish ethics).
* [[Mashgiach]] – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [[kashrut]] and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.

[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|left|Scenes from the [[Book of Esther]] decorate the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] dating from 244 CE]]
At its core, the Tanakh is an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with [[God]] from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that [[Isaac]], his second son, would inherit the [[Land of Israel]] (then called [[Canaan]]). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son [[Jacob]] were enslaved in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and God commanded [[Moses]] to lead [[the Exodus]] from Egypt. At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], they received the [[Torah]]—the five books of Moses. These books, together with [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]] are known as ''Torah Shebikhtav'' as opposed to the [[Oral Torah]], which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the [[land of Israel]] where the [[tabernacle]] was planted in the city of [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the [[Philistines]] to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] the [[prophet]] that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed [[Saul the King|Saul]] to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint [[David]] in his stead.

[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|The [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a remnant of the wall encircling the [[Second Temple]]. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest site in Judaism.]]

Once King David was established, he told the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son, [[Solomon]], to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] and the throne would never depart from his children.

Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the ''[[Oral Torah]]'' or ''[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]'', were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [[Rabbi]] [[Judah HaNasi]] (Judah the Prince) in the [[Mishnah]], redacted ''circa'' 200 CE. The [[Talmud]] was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]], rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14213-talmud|title=Talmud|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|author=Wilhelm Bacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars [[Ravina I]], [[Ravina II]], and [[Rav Ashi]] by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.

Some critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the [[documentary hypothesis]] and suggest that the [[Torah]] consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.&lt;ref name="yehezkal" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="biblical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="speiser" /&gt; Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="history12" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to [[Zoroastrian]] dualism.&lt;ref name="ephraim" /&gt; In this view, it was only by the [[Hellenic period]] that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt;

[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] argues that the origins of biblical [[Yahweh]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Asherah]], and [[Ba'al]], may be rooted in earlier [[Canaanite religion]], which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the [[Greek pantheon]].&lt;ref name="goddesses" /&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{Main article|Ancient Israel and Judah|Babylonian captivity|Hellenistic Judaism|Hasmonean Kingdom|Iudaea Province|Bar Kokhba revolt}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[United Monarchy]] was established under [[Saul the King|Saul]] and continued under [[King David]] and [[Solomon]] with its capital in [[Jerusalem]]. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (in the north) and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] valley. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [[First Temple]] that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to [[Babylonia]] and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] seventy years later, a period known as the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. A new [[Second Temple]] was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.

During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed.

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE. After [[First Jewish–Roman War|the Great Revolt]] (66–73 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple. [[Hadrian]] built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] 132–136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the [[Torah]] and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a ''[[religio licita]]'' ("legitimate religion") until the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]] in the fourth century.

Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).

===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===
[[File:Parochet of Beth Jakov Macedonia.jpg|thumb|The [[Torah Ark]] of the Beth Jakov synagogue in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]]]
Around the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Zealots]], [[Essenes]], and [[early Christianity|Christians]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara E. Karesh|author2=Mitchell M. Hurvitz|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA444|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6982-8|pages=444–|quote=The Sadducees disappeared when the second Temple was destroyed in the year 70 C.E and Pharisaic Judaism became the preeminent Jewish sect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] survived, but by breaking with Judaism and [[Schism (religion)|becoming a separate religion]]; the [[Pharisees]] survived but in the form of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (today, known simply as "Judaism"). The [[Sadducees]] rejected the [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], relying only on the [[Torah]] as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The [[Samaritans]] practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)

Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [[oral law]] as recorded in the [[Mishnah]] (and developed by later rabbis in the two [[Talmud]]s), relying instead only upon the [[Tanakh]]. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the [[Malikites]], and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the [[Karaism|Karaite]] sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.

Over a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]), the [[Sephardi Jews]] (of Spain, [[Portugal]], and [[North Africa]]), the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Yemenite Jews]] from the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.

===Persecutions===
{{Main article|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}
[[Antisemitism]] arose during the [[Middle Ages]], in the form of persecutions, [[pogrom]]s, [[forced conversion]]s, expulsions, social restrictions and [[ghetto]]ization.

This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism.&lt;ref name="History, religion, and antisemitism" /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R. "[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History]." ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like [[Almohads#Status of non-Muslims|Almohad's persecutions]].&lt;ref name="ugr"&gt;Amira K.

MEAH, sección Hebreo 56 (2007), 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasidism===
{{Main article|Hasidic Judaism}}

Hasidic Judaism was founded by [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)|Yisroel ben Eliezer]] (1700–1760), also known as the ''Ba'al Shem Tov'' (or ''Besht''). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called [[Shtiebel]], which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to [[Tzadik]]s, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a ''refreshment'' of original Judaism. As some have put it: ''"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost"''. Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as [[Misnagdim]], (lit. "opponents"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of [[Haredi Judaism]].

===The Enlightenment and new religious movements===
{{Main article|Haskalah|Jewish religious movements}}

In the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, [[Haskalah]] or the "Jewish Enlightenment", began, especially in [[Central Europe]] and [[Western Europe]], in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.

In [[Central Europe]], followed by [[Great Britain]] and the United States, [[Reform Judaism|Reform (or Liberal) Judaism]] developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating [[Protestant]] decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]]. After massive movements of Jews following [[The Holocaust]] and the creation of [[Israel|the state of Israel]], these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.

===Spectrum of observance===
[[File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG|thumb|Judaism is practised in all parts of the world, for example in a synagogue in downtown [[Mumbai]].]]
Countries such as the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]] contain large Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the [[National Jewish Population Survey]], in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second largest—4.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews out of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million had some sort of connection to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/studies/details.cfm?StudyID=307 |title=National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive" /&gt;

Birth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7.&lt;ref name="relations" /&gt; (Replacement rate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40–50% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1990 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the [[Diaspora]], but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as [[Haredi Judaism]]. The [[Baal teshuva]] movement is a movement of Jews who have "returned" to religion or become more observant.

==Judaism and other religions==
===Christianity and Judaism===
{{Main article|Christianity and Judaism}}
{{See also|Christianity and antisemitism|Christian–Jewish reconciliation}}
[[Christianity]] was originally a sect of [[Second Temple Judaism]], but the two religions [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|diverged in the first century]]. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[Jewish views on sin|sin]], the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the [[God in Judaism|nature of God]] himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as [[Shituf]] or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in [[dual-covenant theology]] emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kendall Soulen, The God of Israel and Christian Theology, (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] upheld the ''[[Sicut Judaeis|Constitution pro Judæis]]'' (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated {{quotation|We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live."&lt;ref name="BaskinSeeskin2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Judith R.|last2=Seeskin|first2=Kenneth|title=The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521869607|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Until [[Jewish emancipation|their emancipation]] in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns ([[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]]), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval [[Sweden]]). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]]. The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935.

Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the [[Apostolic Age|early years of Christianity]] and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the [[Early Christianity|ensuing centuries]]. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="HarriesAfter" /&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;ref name="Dawidowicz" /&gt; These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews,&lt;ref name=JCPSHorst&gt;Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. 5 May 2009.

One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law "which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent." Another was to help those "who suffered through repressive laws, or violence." About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends—German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries—were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ...

The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism, have been changed mostly positive since [[World War II]]. Pope [[John Paul II]] and the Catholic Church have "upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people" as well as a [[Dual-covenant theology|reaffirmation of the covenant]] between [[God in Christianity|God]] and the Jews.&lt;ref name="Wigoder1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigoder|first=Geoffrey|title=Jewish-Christian Relations Since the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9N9RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719026393|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.&lt;ref name="news.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|title=Vatican issues new document on Christian-Jewish dialogue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and Judaism===
{{Main article|Islam and Judaism}}
Both Judaism and [[Islam]] arose from the patriarch [[Abraham]], and they are therefore considered [[Abrahamic religions]]. In both Jewish and [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jewish and [[Arabs|Arab peoples]] are descended from the two sons of Abraham—[[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]], respectively. While both religions are [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when [[Islam]] originated and spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Indeed, the years 712 to 1066 CE under the [[Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasid]] rulers have been called the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as [[dhimmis]]. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims.&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; For example, they had to pay the [[jizya]], a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males,&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref name="lewis14" /&gt; Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], a practice not found in either the [[Qur'an]] or the [[hadiths]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]] and inconsistently enforced.&lt;ref name="lewis15" /&gt; Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in [[Persia]], and by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]],&lt;ref name="stillman" /&gt; as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see: [[Mawza Exile]]). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in [[Morocco]], for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="lewis16" /&gt;

In the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/263/why-jews-fled-the-arab-countries "Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries"]. ''Middle East Forum''. Retrieved on 28 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shumsky, Dmitry.

'Haaretz''. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have chosen to live in [[Israel]]. Today, antisemitic themes including [[Holocaust denial]] have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as [[Hizbullah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of [[Refah Partisi]].&lt;ref name="Lewis_MEQ" /&gt;

===Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism===
There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is [[Messianic Judaism]], a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Feher1998p140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194a /&gt;&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt; that incorporates elements of Judaism with the [[Christianity#Beliefs|tenets of Christianity]].&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194b /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherbok_179" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2000p223 /&gt; The movement generally states that [[Jesus]] is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the [[Trinity|Three Divine Persons]],&lt;ref name="UMJC-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trinitarianism" /&gt; and that [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior.&lt;ref name="JeC3" /&gt; Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism.&lt;ref name="MJSelfID" /&gt; Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of [[Pauline Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Denominations" /&gt;

Other examples of [[syncretism]] include [[Semitic neopaganism]], a loosely organized sect which incorporates [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Wicca]]n beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; [[Jewish Buddhists]], another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith; and some [[Jewish Renewal|Renewal Jews]] who borrow freely and openly from [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religions, and other faiths.

The [[Kabbalah Centre]], which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a [[New Age]] movement that claims to popularize the [[kabbalah]], part of the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish esoteric tradition]].

This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body—as did, for instance, the gnostics—but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|chapter= Chapter 20: The Rise of Messianic Judaism
|chapterurl=
|quote= Messianic Judaism, although it advocated the idea of an independent movement of Jewish converts, remained the offspring of the missionary movement, and the ties would never be broken. The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.

Unlike the previous communities of Jewish Christians, Messianic Jewish congregations were largely independent of control from missionary societies or Christian denominations, even though they still wanted the acceptance of the larger evangelical community.

|quote=When the term resurfaced in Israel in the 1940s and 1950s, it designated all Jews who accepted Christianity in its Protestant evangelical form. Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', "Christians" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.

| quote = To convert to the Jewish sect of HaDerech, accepting Yeshua as your King is the first act after one's heart turns toward HaShem and His Torah – as one can not obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God, and we love God by following his Messiah. Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him, then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community. It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come.... Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem, and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King, is nothing but a surgical procedure, or worse, could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come – at which point, what good is Messiah Yeshua, the Word of HaShem to you? He would have died for nothing!... As a convert from the nations, part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant, if you are a male, is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision. Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God's commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted....If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah.

'''''Koinonos''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κοινωνός}}) is an [[Ancient Greek]] word, generally thought to mean [[Friendship|companion]]; however it has been used extensively in ancient writing with a wide variety of meanings. Its original form is κοινωνός and it was later translated to Koinonos. one can read it as "koy-no-nos". It can mean married partner, business partner, friend or companion in faith as well. It is generally used with reference to "sharing".&lt;ref name="Schaberg2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Schaberg|title=The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene: Legends, Apocrypha, and the Christian Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mq1ckqdORUC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=15 November 2012|date=31 August 2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-1645-2|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KellerKeller2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Virginia Burrus, Catherine Keller|author2=Catherine Keller|title=Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHzT57pDVi0C&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=15 November 2012|date=15 November 2006|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8232-2636-8|pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in the [[Gospel of Philip]] to note the relationship between Jesus and [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref name="Schaberg2004"/&gt;

The '''Lama''' of the [[Tamang people]], is an ancient priestly clan having resided in the area now known as [[Nepal]] since antiquity and predating the spread of Buddhism, is associated with spiritual and religious dealings, including [[ancestor worship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|date=2004-01-01|publisher=William Carey Library|isbn=9780878083619|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asia-planet.net/nepal/museum.htm|title=Nepal Ethnographic Museum|website=www.asia-planet.net|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bluespace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebluespace.com/the-tamang-people/ |title=The Tamang People - The Blue Space Guides Nepal |publisher=Thebluespace.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, other ''Swagen Bhai'' (Tamang kinship clans) perform priestly rituals, such as shaman ''Jhankris'', but the Lama are most associated with priesthood.
 
This particular ''Swagen Bhai'' (kinship clan) of the Tamang are so associated with religion that all Tamangs are addressed as ''[[Lama (honorific)]]'' by other highland [[Tibeto-Burman]] ethnic groups in the region, such as [[Gurung]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], etc.   Nevertheless, only those of ''Swagen Bhai Lama'' are truly Lama.  As with all ''Swagen Bhai'', there are complex restrictions on intermarriage between kinship clans.  
The exact relationship between ''Bon Lamaism'', their religion of antiquity that survives to modern times, [[Gurung Dharma]], the religion of a nearby and related ethnolinguistically close people, and [[Bon]] Buddhist tradition (Bonpa), has not been established.  Nevertheless, the Tamang are considered to be least influenced by [[Khas]]-ization of all ethnic groups in Nepal,&lt;ref name=

[[File:RELIGIONES.png|thumb|Religious symbols in clock-wise order from top: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Bahá'í Faith]],  [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]],  [[Slavic neopaganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Heathenism (Germanic paganism)]], [[Semitic neopaganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Kemetism]] (Egyptian paganism), [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism (Greek paganism)]], [[Italo-Roman neopaganism]].]]
While [[religion]] is hard to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who defined it as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."&lt;ref&gt;(Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;}} A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category."&lt;ref&gt;(Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the universe. They tend to derive [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s, or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com|title=World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[faith]]" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviours]], including [[clergy|clerical hierarchies]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[local church|congregations]] of [[laity]], regular meetings or services for the purposes of [[veneration]] of a [[deity]] or for [[prayer]], [[shrine|holy places]] (either natural or architectural) or [[religious text]]s. Certain religions also have a [[sacred language]] often used in [[liturgy|liturgical]] services. The practice of a religion may also include [[sermon]]s, commemoration of the activities of a [[god]] or gods, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[rite]]s, [[ceremonies]], [[worship]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[marriage]]s, [[meditation]], [[invocation]], [[mediumship]], [[religious music|music]], [[religious art|art]], [[sacred dance|dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] [[phenomena]] such as [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[near-death experience]]s and [[reincarnation]], along with many other [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parapsych.org/base/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iands.org/about-ndes/key-nde-facts.html|title=Key Facts about Near-Death Experiences|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Religious studies|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories: [[major religious groups|world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international faiths; [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and [[new religious movement]]s, which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.{{further information|Prehistoric religion|History of religion}}

This was propagated by certain [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], [[social work]]ers, [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalists]] and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officials. Some of the cases ended in prosecution and imprisonment. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have had several incidents of alleged SRA which received national and international news coverage. Other countries have also had isolated events in which abuse or murder took place with Satanic ritual elements, including Argentina and Brazil.

==Australia==

===Perth, Western Australia===
In 1991, police in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] linked Scott Gozenton, a self-professed Satanist, with organised child sexual abuse. His lawyer claimed 13 Satanic [[coven]]s existed in the area, holding bizarre orgies involving children, and that Gozenton had been followed and threatened by "coven" members throughout the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Humphries | title = Child Sex Abuse Linked With Satanism: Police | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 1991-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melbourne, Victoria===
In 2001, the Melbourne diocese of the [[Catholic Church]] acknowledged as "substantially true" allegations that a Melbourne priest took part in Satanic ritual abuse in which a number of deaths occurred in the 1960s, and paid compensation to a surviving victim.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hughes, Church pays victim of sex and death rituals: Priest's satanic life, Herald Sun, 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Coast, New South Wales===
In 1999, two journalists from the Sun-Herald claimed to have seen evidence of the ritual abuse of children. They interviewed six mothers whose children had disclosed experiences of SRA and organised abuse in New South Wales. The children's disclosures were corroborating, although they had never met one another, and they had been able to draw representations of "Satanic" ritual sites which were similar to ritual sites uncovered by police on the central coast of New South Wales. One mother stated that her sons remembered being drugged and hypnotised. "He said they dressed in black robes and had eye and mouth pieces cut out," she said. "I know they're  dangerous people. I have had warnings outside the house telling me to stop investigations. We're fearful for our lives. The boys never want me out of their sight."&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Wood and martin Chulov, Evil In The Woods, The Sun Herald, 8 August 1999, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
{{Main article|Anísio Ferreira de Sousa}}
In the early 1990s, Superior Universal Alignment, an Argentinian-based international cult, was implicated in the ritualistic murders of several children. One of the leaders of the group, Osvaldo Marcineiro, confessed to murdering a number of young children in Satanic rituals in which the children were tortured and their body parts cannibalised. A number of prominent citizens were arrested in relation to the murders, and it later emerged that they had paid the cult to conduct the murderous ceremonies. A search of cult member's houses turned up cult registers, guns, hooded cloaks, 100 videotapes of cult ceremonies and satanist publications, including a 200-page book by cult leader Valentina de Andrade called ''God, the Great Farce''. Brazilian authorities suggested that the cult was connected to Satanic groups internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Lewan, Satanic Cult Killings Spread Fear in Southern Brazil, ''The [[Associated Press]]'', 26 October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, five members of the Superior Universal Alignment cult in the Amazonian town of Altamira were convicted for the ritualistic murders of three children and the castration of two others. The victims were aged between eight and thirteen years, and they were kidnapped, tortured or killed between 1989 and 1993. Their genitals were removed and used in Satanic rituals by 75-year old village clairvoyant, Valentina de Andrade, the leader of the Superior Universal Alignment cult.&lt;ref&gt;Gamini, Gabriella, "Seer for trial in voodoo murders", ''[[The Times]]'', 9 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; De Andrade had previously been sought by police in Argentina and Uruguay prior to her arrest in Brazil on suspicion of involvement in other satanic ritual killings.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Cultic Studies Association|The Cult Observer]] (American Family Foundation), Vol. 10 No. 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the castration of victims, two doctors involved in the sect removed the victim's other organs for sale on the international black market. Other people sentenced in relation to the murders included a former police officer, a businessman and the son of an influential landowner. The charges related to the murders of three young children and the attempted murder of another, however, victim's families say that there were at least nineteen other murdered children. The cult is based in Argentina and has branches in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor gets 56 years for Brazil sect killings, 11 September 2003, [[Reuters]] News and Five&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{Main|Michelle Remembers|Martensville satanic sex scandal}}
One of the earliest claims of SRA was made in the book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' co-written by Canadian psychiatrist [[Lawrence Pazder]] and Michelle Smith, later Pazder's wife. The book detailed a Satanic cult that allegedly operated in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author = Paul Grescoe |title = Things That Go Bump in Victoria |work = [[Maclean's]] |date = October 27, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wenegrat, Brant |title=Theater of disorder: patients, doctors, and the construction of illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] | url =  |year=2001 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5i5utgOjvgC&amp;pg=PA190 190–192] |isbn=0-19-514087-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protracted child custody case contested in family court in Hamilton, Ontario, from 1985-1987, centred on allegations of Satanic ritual abuse; it was later documented in a book written by a Globe and Mail reporter who was assigned to cover the case.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2525179-passages-respected-author-longtime-reporter/ Passages: Respected Author, Longtime Reporter]''. The Hamilton Spectator, April 8 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marron, Kevin. ''Ritual Abuse: Canada's Most Infamous Trial on Child Abuse''. Seal Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Martensville Satanic sex scandal occurred in Martensville, Saskatchewan in 1992, where an allegation of day care sexual abuse hysteria escalated into claims of satanic ritual abuse.

==Ireland==
In 2007, a jury at [[Dublin]] Country Coroner's court unanimously ruled that an infant found stabbed to death over three decades ago was the daughter of Cynthia Owen (then 'Sindy Murphy').&lt;ref&gt;[http://noleenbetrayed40years.blogspot.com.au/ NoleenBetrayed40Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408234006/http://noleenbetrayed40years.blogspot.com.au/ |date=2014-04-08 }}.

==The Netherlands==
In 1989 a group of parents published allegations in a conservative magazine that their children had witnessed SRA and had been ritually abused from May, 1987 until October 1988 in [[Oude Pekela]], a city in the north-eastern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[the Netherlands]].  During the initial investigation, only the non-ritual aspects were reported in the press and investigated by the authorities and the allegations were unconfirmed.  In 1989 the [[Conservatism|conservative]] Christian news program ''Tijdsein'' reported allegations that included Satanic ritual abuse, to which there was no official response.  After attending a conference in which the concept of satanic ritual abuse was discussed, Oude Pekela [[general practitioner]]s Fred Jonker and Ietje Jonker-Bakker alleged that several children had been abused by unknown men in the context of Satanic rituals.  This was first reported in a lecture at the Institute of Education of London University and later published in several [[academic journal]]s in both English and Dutch,&lt;ref name=Jonker1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jonker, F. |author2=Jonker-bakker, P.  | year = 1991 | title = Experiences with ritualist child sexual abuse: a case study from the Netherlands | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 15 | pages = 191–196 | url = http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429991  | accessdate = 2007-10-20 | pmid =2043971  | doi = 10.1016/0145-2134(91)90064-K | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jonker F &amp; Jonker-Bakker I | title = Onderzoek in Oude Pekela | journal = Maandblad Geestelijke volksgezondheid | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | year = 1994 | pages = 251–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their findings were heavily criticised by American and Dutch scholars.&lt;ref name = Beetstra&gt;{{cite book | last = Beetstra | first = T A | chapter = Massahysterie in de Verenigde Staten en Nederland: De affaire rond de McMartin Pre-School en het ontuchtschandaal in Oude Pekela |editor=Burger P |editor2=Koetsenruijter W | title = Mediahypes en moderne sagen: Sterke verhalen in het nieuws | publisher = Leiden, Stichting Neerlandistiek Leiden | year = 2004 | pages =53–69 | chapterurl = http://tjallingbeetstra.eu/files/Massahysterie%20in%20de%20Verenigde%20Staten%20en%20Nederland.PDF |chapter-format = PDF | language = Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merckelbach HLGJ &amp; Crombag HFM | title = Hervonden herinneringen en andere misverstanden | publisher = Contact, Amsterdam/Antwerpen Contact | year = 1996 | pages = 183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Putnam1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Putnam, F.W. | year = 1991 | title = The Satanic Ritual Abuse Controversy. | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect: the International Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–79 | url = http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429989  | accessdate = 2008-06-10 | doi = 10.1016/0145-2134(91)90062-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wessel | first = I |author2=Merckelbach HLGJ  | title = Onderzoek in Oude Pekela (2) | journal = Maandblad Geestelijke volksgezondheid | volume = 49 | issue = 5  | year = 1994 | pages = 554–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National authorities were informed in 1991 and 1992 of the allegations, though no action was taken until the press was informed.&lt;ref name = Het&gt;{{cite news | last = De Fauwe | first = L | title = Ritueel misbruik van kinderen voor satan | publisher = [[Het Parool]] | date = 1993-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Aanhangsel tot het Verslag der Handelingen van de Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal | year = 1992–1993 | issue = 770}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Secretary of Justice responded to the allegations by appointing the ''Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik'' multidisciplinary workgroup to study SRA in the Netherlands, which produced a report in 1994.&lt;ref name = Werkgroep&gt;{{Cite book | author = Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik | title = Rapport van de Werkgroep Ritueel Misbruik | location = Den Haag | publisher = Ministerie van Justitie, Directie Staats- en Strafrecht | year = 1994 | pages = 65–66 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report concluded that it was unlikely SRA had occurred or the allegations were factually true, suggested the allegations were a [[defence mechanism]] produced in part by suggestive questioning by 'believing' therapists, and that the stories were contemporary legends dispersed through a network of therapists and patients who were concerned with [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref name = Werkgroep/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
There have been a number of cases in the [[United Kingdom]] in which SRA has been alleged. Some of these cases have garnered significant media attention, and they are listed below.

The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] documented allegations of ritual abuse in 1990, with the publication of survey findings that, of 66 child protection teams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 14 teams had received reports of ritual abuse from children and seven of them were working directly with children who had been ritually abused, sometimes in groups of 20.&lt;ref&gt;Libby Jukes and Richard Duce, NSPCC says [[ritual child abuse]] is rife, ''The Times'', 13 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation into SRA allegations by the British government produced over two hundred reports, of which only three were substantiated and proved to be examples of [[Satanic ritual abuse#Pseudo-satanism|pseudosatanic]], in which sexual abuse was the actual motivation and the rituals were incidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=La Fontaine, J S. |title=The extent and nature of organised and ritual abuse: research findings |publisher=HMSO |location=London |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-11-321797-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-04-29|url = http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=157278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = LaFontaine&gt;{{cite book |author=LaFontaine, J.

===Rochdale===
In 1990 there was a case in [[Rochdale]] which around twenty children were removed from their homes by social services who alleged the existence of SRA after discovering 'Satanic indicators'. No evidence was found of Satanic apparatus, and charges were dismissed when a court ruled the allegations were untrue. The children who were removed from their homes sued the city council in 2006 for compensation and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul |last=Lewis |authorlink= |title= 'Satanic abuse' case families sue council for negligence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1684205,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-01-12 |accessdate = 2007-10-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orkney===
{{Main|South Ronaldsay child abuse scandal}}

In April 1991, a [[Sheriff Principal|sheriff]] ruled that the evidence was seriously flawed and the children were returned home.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

It described the dismissal of the first judgment as "most unfortunate" and criticized all those involved, including the social workers, the police, and the Orkney Islands Council. Social workers' training, methods, and judgment were given special condemnation, and the report stated that the concept of "ritual abuse" was "not only unwarrantable at present but may affect the objectivity of practitioners and parents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Gillian | authorlink = | title = Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 2005 | location = | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mp91ArpXcH0C&amp;pg=PA287 287] | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-57806-789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lord Clyde | year = 1992 | title = The Report of the Inquiry into the Removal of Children from Orkney in February 1991 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] | pages = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 government report based on three years of research found that there was no foundation to any of the Satanic abuse claims.&lt;ref name = Orkney/&gt;

In October 1987 children were removed from their families in Nottingham, and in February 1989 a [[Broxtowe, Nottingham|Broxtowe]] family was charged with multigenerational child sexual abuse and neglect. A 600-page report on the incident concluded that there was no evidence of the SRA claims made by children or corroborating adults. Though the children may have been 'sadistically terrorized', allegations of organized Satanic abuse were found to be baseless and the indicators used by the Social Services department were without validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Thorpe | first = W. |author2=Gwatkin, J.B. |author3=Glenn, W.P. |author4=Gregory, M.F. | date=  1990-06-07 | title = Revised Joint Enquiry Report | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~dlheb/jetrepor.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | publisher = Nottinghamshire Social Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidwelly===
In March 2011, four adults who lived in a cul-de-sac in the Welsh town of [[Kidwelly]] were convicted of multiple sex offences against children and young adults. The group led by Colin Batley was described by the media as a "Satanic sex cult", a "quasi-religious sex cult" and a "paedophile cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-12677043|title=Kidwelly sex cult: Town unaware of 'evil paedophile'|date=9 March 2011|work=BBC News South West Wales|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Colin Batley, leader of sex cult preying on children, could spend life in jail|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/sex-cult-leader-colin-batley-sentenced|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the group members were not followers of [[Satanism]].

In the [[United States]], major allegations of Satanic ritual abuse occurred in the [[Kern County child abuse cases]], [[McMartin preschool trial]] and the [[West Memphis 3]], which garnered world-wide media coverage. It was eventually determined that no satanic abuse ever took place in these cases due to false testimony and police misconduct. There have been countless, debunked allegations of SRA in the United States; of which the most recent allegation was [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory|Pizzagate]]; a speculated pedophile ring in the Washington D.C area at supposed ping pong themed restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. In the allegations, [[Hillary Clinton]] was an avid supporter and member in the pedophilia ring, with various sources of selected evidence pointing to her possible involvement and the possible involvement of Clinton's associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/pizzagate-a-deep-dish-slice-of-fake-news-delusion/article33282231/|title=Pizzagate: A deep-dish slice of fake news delusion|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Minnesota===
The first such case occurred in [[Jordan, Minnesota]], in 1983, where several children made allegations against an unrelated man and their parents. The man confessed and then identified a number of the children’s parents as perpetrators. Ultimately twenty-four adults were charged with child abuse though only three went to trial with two [[acquittal]]s and one [[conviction]].&lt;ref name = Scalia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-478.ZD.html | title = Supreme Court Collection at Cornell University Law School | last = Scalia | first = Antonin | authorlink = Antonin Scalia |author-link2=William J.

During the investigation, the children made [[allegation]]s regarding the manufacturing of [[child pornography]], ritualistic animal sacrifice, [[Coprophagia#Humans|coprophagia]], [[urophagia]] and [[infanticide]], at which point the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hechler, David |title=The battle and the backlash: the child sexual abuse war |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-669-14097-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No criminal charges resulted from the FBI investigation, and in his review of the case, the [[Attorney General]] noted that the initial investigation by the local police and county attorney was so poor that it had destroyed the opportunity to fully investigate the children’s allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Humphrey | first = Herbert | year = 1985 | title = Report on Scott County investigations | location = Minneapolis, MN | publisher = Minnesota Attorney General's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the Minnesota case in his summation on a later case, and stated, "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged," and cited the repeated, well-intentioned but coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.&lt;ref name = Scalia/&gt;  The bizarre allegations of the children, the ambiguities of the investigation and the unsuccessful prosecutions were widely covered by the media. A number of accused parents confessed to sexually abusing their children, received immunity, and underwent treatment for sexual abuse, while parental rights for six other children in the case were terminated.&lt;ref name=Faller2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Faller, K.C. | year = 2004 | title = Sexual Abuse of Children: Contested Issues and Competing Interests | journal = Criminal Justice Review | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 358 | url = http://cjr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/29/2/358  | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | doi = 10.1177/073401680402900206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bahá'í texts sidebar}}

'''''Lawh-i-Anta'l-Kafi''''' or the '''''Long Healing Prayer''''' is a prayer written in Arabic by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the [[Bahá'u'lláh#`Akká|'Akká period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/rg/rg.leiden.html Writings of Bahá'u'lláh - Part Two: The Leiden List of Bahá'u'lláh's Tablets.]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorized English translation was done in 1980 by Habib Taherzadeh and a Committee at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]].

The main part of the prayer consists of numerous rhythmic invocations of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]], each ending with the phrase ''"Thou the Sufficing, Thou the Healing, Thou the Abiding, O Thou Abiding One."''&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author = Hatcher, J.S. |year = 1997 |title = The Ocean of His Words: A Reader's Guide to the Art of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-259-7 |pages = 145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer ends with a supplication for healing and protection, and includes the phrase ''"protect the bearer of this blessed Tablet, and whoso reciteth it, and whoso cometh upon it, and whoso passeth around the house wherein it is. Heal Thou, then, by it every sick, diseased and poor one"'', which gives this prayer its [[talisman]]ic nature.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= talismans |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Norwegian composer [[Lasse Thoresen]] composed a piece of choral music for the Bergen International Music Festival in May 1996, in which the ''Long Healing Prayer'' was sung, first in the original Arabic and then in English.&lt;ref&gt;Bahai.org. ''[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-2-8.html Profiles: Lasse Thoresen, Norway]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Bahá'í healing prayers==
Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other healing prayers, including a prayer for women, one for infants, and  a well-known short prayer starting with the phrase ''"Thy Name is my healing"'', which is part of Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Lawh-i-Tibb]]'' (''Tablet to a Physician'').&lt;ref name="smith-tibb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Medicine, Tablet of |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

{{Ayyavazhi}}
'''Neetham''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:&lt;small&gt;நீதம்&lt;/small&gt;) are the primary virtues to be followed according to the [[Akilam]] the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]]. They are found in [[Akilam one]], which is the first section of the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]], and in the middle of the [[meta-narrative]] events of the [[:Category:Eight Yugas|eight yugas]]. This shows that the society, its people, and the ruling king once lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of God in all their works, deeds, and activities during early ages.

The [[Akilam]] points this out as an example, and describes how the people should live in the world. It also forms a part of [[Ayyavazhi]] ethics. The Neethams are split into three. They are,

# '''Manu Neetham''': How an individual should personify him/herself with good morality.
# '''Raja Neetham''': How an individual should be to the society or Nation, and in turn how the Nation should be to a common man.
# '''Deiva Neetham''': How an individual should be before God.

== Manu Neetham — Justice of Common Man==

The '''Manu Neetham''' describes how a person should act in society. It also describes the correct [[moral]] character of the people, and their way of life in harmony with nature (particularly women) in the early ages.

Followers believe that all the events and actions that happen in their lives are activated by [[God]]. Therefore, they prefer not to seek any individual supremacy for any of their activities or achievements. All faithful followers believe that everyone is equal, in spite of the presence of different castes.

In addition, they do not find anyone inferior or superior to others with respect to the jobs they do. They neither do any menial jobs nor make others do so. In turn, they live with a mutual understanding of others not unlike the innocence of children.

===Morality===

*[[virginity]] is treated with highest respect, especially in women.
**This not only means physical virginity, but a kind of mental "virginity" as well.
***This is described as keeping one's mind clear, and not allowing the mind to become "instable" or "impure". In other words, virginity also means preserving moral and virginal thinking.
**Because of this, [[Women]] do not speak often.
*Followers are to respect their [[father]] and [[mother]], and keep them at equal status with [[God]].
*Honesty is considered an important virtue.
*Women are taught to respect their [[husband]]s.
**[[Wives]] sleep only after making their husbands sleep.
***For example, women will wake up and bathe before dawn, [[prayer|pray]], then clean the house as part of her daily routine.

Thus the people of the [[society]] would live: always striving to be role models for others. This [[ethical]] code is considered by followers to have been given by [[Ayyavazhi]] scriptures to mankind.

== Raja Neetham — Justice of Governance==

This '''Raja Neetham''' or '''Arasa Neetham''' says, how an individual should be to the [[society]] or [[nation]], and in turn how the nation should be to a common [[man]]. This was derived from the meta-narrative events, one practiced in the society.

The king ruled the country with great care, by giving more importance to individual needs. He respect each and every individual with equal status. The king consider the comfort of the subjects of the nation as the comfort of himself. In all the 1008 Pathis (The place where [[God]] is) the [[puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]s were conducted rightly and in timely manner. The [[temples]], the watermeans such as [[pond]]s, [[Water well|well]]s were supervised and were repaired frequently. [[Anna Dharmam]], the charity on food is conducted frequently at choultries. The people of the nation always respect religious persons and [[pilgrims]], and help them by all possible means, and consider that serving them (religious persons) is like serving God.

The king collects one-sixth of the means of people as [[tax]]. If  any one says that they will not be able to give one-sixth of their means, the king don't use to compel them. If any one pays tax without any pending for about twelve years the King use to discount their tax for two years. The judgement from the king for the judicial cases of people will be accurate. He gives more importance for his people than for himself.

===Right Judgement===

This story tells about a king who follows the Raja Neetham rightly and so his accuracy in judgement.

Once a [[hunter]] choose a bird as his target and points his arrow towards it. The bird notes this and flies away and the hunter follows the bird. The bird flew and fell in front of the Chozha king and asked him to rescue from the hunter. Following this the hunter came in front of the king and demanded the bird. He also says, "whole of my today's time is wasted behind this bird. I and my family has to fulfill our hunger by this bird." On the other hand, the bird demanded the king to save it from the hunter.

The king feels that both of them are right from their own view point and sensed both the fulfillment of the hunger of hunter and saving the life of the bird is his duty as a king. So taking care the two subjects, the king cut an equal quantity of [[flesh]] to the bird from his limb and gave it to the hunter. So he saved the life of the bird and on the other hand saved the hunter's family from being hungry. As king, he treated both of his subjects equally and also fulfilled both of their needs.

&lt;small&gt;''Note: This story is not fully narrated as above in [[Akilam]] and only quoted.''&lt;/small&gt;

== Deiva Neetham — Justice of Divinity==

This '''Deiva Neetham''' tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that (old) age, and tells the way by which one should be get divinized. The most important point is, this part says that when the other two Neethams are correctly followed the Deiva Neetham will be automatically fall in the right path. This concept was reveals from the [[mythical]] narration.

The reign of the king (above in Raja Neetham) was identified as a good rule by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. [[Narayana]], [[Brahma]], [[Lekhsmi]] and all devas appreciated this rule. They went to [[Mount Kailash|kayilai]] to meet [[Shiva|Siva]] to tell about this.

They met Siva in Kayilai and told that the King chozha is ruling his country genuinely. They also told Siva about the judgement of the king in the matter of the '''Hunter and the Bird'''. Also they brought to his attention, other merits of the reign of the king. They also demanded that, since the king is so genuine, talented and accurate in following the principles, he should order the devas to do the duties to his nation correctly. Hearing this Siva ordered the [[Krishna|Mayon]] to order the devas to do all duties timidly. As per this Mayon ordered,

*  [[Bhoomaadevi]], goddess of [[earth]] to protect his nation.
*  [[Varuna]], the [[God of Rain]] to shed rain thrice a month in the country of that king.
*  The [[clouds]] to act as an umbrella and protect his nation.
*  [[Vayu]], the [[God of Wind]] to fan his nation with gentle breeze.
*  [[Sivayu]]s to be alert on the places where the poojas are held in his nation.
*  [[Nithira Devi]], the [[Goddess of sleepiness]] not to disturb unnecessarily the subjects of his nation.

As per the order of [[Shiva|Siva]] all activities were done by devas. Also they made all [[animal]]s to live in harmony with each other and with the people. They also made the crops of his nation to give good yield for the people.

{{Irreligion sidebar|expanded=nontheism}}
'''Nontheistic religions''' are traditions of [[religious belief|thought]] within a [[religion | religious context]]—some otherwise aligned with [[theism]], others not—in which [[nontheism]] informs religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Williams|first= J. Paul|author2= Horace L. Friess|authorlink2=Horace L. Friess |title= The Nature of Religion|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year= 1962|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 3–17|jstor= 1384088|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|doi= 10.2307/1384088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nontheism has been applied{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} to the fields of [[Christian apologetics]] and general [[liberal theology]], and plays significant roles in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Satanism]]. While many approaches to religion exclude nontheism by definition, some inclusive definitions of religion show how religious practice and belief do not depend on the presence of god(s). For example, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]] distinguish between religion and [[spirituality]], but provide a definition of the term that avoids the usual reduction to "religions of the book":

{{quote|Religion can be defined as a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Existence of gods ===
{{See also|God in Buddhism}}

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] said that ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' (translated as "gods") do exist, but they were regarded as still being trapped in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=May 26, 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not necessarily wiser than we. In fact, the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the gods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas|year=1997|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html|author=Susan Elbaum Jootla|editor=Access To Insight|location=Kandy, Sri Lanka|chapter=II. The Buddha Teaches Deities|quote="Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods." "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings." "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the Buddha, the denial of the existence of a [[creator deity]] has been seen as a key point in distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist views.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of an independent creator deity was answered by the Buddha in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]. The Buddha denounced the view of a creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of [[Sassatavada|eternalism]], and like the 61 other views, this belief causes [[Dukkha|suffering]] when one is [[Upādāna|attached]] to it and states these views may lead to desire, aversion and delusion. At the end of the Sutta the Buddha says he knows these 62 views and he also knows the truth that surpasses them.

===Metaphysical questions===
On one occasion, when presented with a problem of [[metaphysics]] by the monk Malunkyaputta, the Buddha responded with the [[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]. When a man is shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison, his family summons the doctor to have the poison removed, and the doctor gives an antidote:&lt;ref name=hanh&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But the man refuses to let the doctor do anything before certain questions can be answered.  The wounded man demands to know who shot the arrow, what his caste and job is, and why he shot him.  He wants to know what kind of bow the man used and how he acquired the ingredients used in preparing the poison.  Malunkyaputta, such a man will die before getting the answers to his questions.  It is no different for one who follows the Way.  I teach only those things necessary to [[Bodhi|realize the Way]].  Things which are not helpful or necessary, I do not teach.}}

== Christianity ==
 {{Main|Secular theology|Christian atheism}}
A few [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] [[theologians]], define a "nontheistic God" as "the ground of all being" rather than as a personal [[divinity|divine]] [[being]]. [[John Shelby Spong]] refers to a theistic God as "a personal being with expanded supernatural, human, and parental qualities, which has shaped every religious idea of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;''A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith Is Dying and How a New Faith Is Being Born'', {{ISBN|0-06-067063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nontheist, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], and [[rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as [[luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Arnold S. "Ability", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 60, No. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bust of Paul Johannes Tillich (daylight).JPG|170px|thumb|right|Bust of [[Paul Tillich]]]]
	
Many of them owe much of their [[theology]] to the work of Christian existentialist [[philosopher]] [[Paul Tillich]], including the phrase "the ground of all being". Another quotation from Tillich is, "God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, Paul. (1951) ''Systematic Theology'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tillich quotation summarizes his conception of God. He does not think of God as a being that exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself. 

===Nontheist Quakers=== 
[[File:Nontheist.JPG|thumb|150px|Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends]]
{{Main|Nontheist Quakers}}
A nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]]. Like theistic Friends, nontheist Friends are actively interested in realizing centered [[peace]], simplicity, integrity, community, equality, [[love]], [[happiness]] and [[social justice]] in the Society of Friends and beyond.

== Hinduism ==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Hinduism is characterised by extremely diverse beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[R.C. Zaehner]], "it is perfectly possible to be a good Hindu whether one's personal views incline toward [[monism]], [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], or even [[atheism]]."&lt;ref name="Catherine Robinson 1992, page 51"&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that it is a religion that neither depends on the existence or non-existence of God or Gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Zaehner, (1966) ''Hinduism'', P.1-2, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, one that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third that is pluralistic and non-absolute. The latter two traditions can be seen as nontheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul J, (2005) ''Nontheistic Conceptions of the Divine'' Ch. 3. in  T''he Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' by William J Wainwright, p.59 . Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-513809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the [[Rig Veda]] mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). [[Max Müller]] termed this [[henotheism]], and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.&lt;ref&gt;Masih, Y. A comparative study of religions, P.164, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000 {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Nasadiya Sukta]], the 129th Hymn of the tenth and final Mandala (or chapter) of the Rig Veda,  considers creation and asks "The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. /Who then knows whence it has arisen?".&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, (1981)''The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns'' (Classic) Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen to contain the intuition that there must be a single principle behind all phenomena: 'That one' (tad ekam), self-sufficient, to which distinctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, Diané and Wilkinson, Robert Thirty-Five Oriental Philosophers, P. 39, Routledge, 1994 {{ISBN|0-415-02596-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendranath (2000), Classical Indian Philosophy: An Introductory Text, p:1 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-8476-8933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with the [[Upanishads]], reckoned to be written in the first millennia (coeval with the ritualistic [[Brahmanas]]), that the Vedic emphasis on ritual was challenged. The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins. Many of these were [[shramana]]s, who represented a non-Vedic tradition rooted in India's pre-Aryan history.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Krejčí, Anna Krejčová (1990) Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East, p:170, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of the Upanishads turned to knowledge, specifically the ultimate identity of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger,Wendy, (1990) ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'',P. 441, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the notion of [[Brahman]], the key idea of the Upanishads, and much later philosophizing has been taken up with deciding whether Brahman is personal or impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian (1998) The World's Religions P.73-74, CUP {{ISBN|0-521-63748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of the nature of Brahman as impersonal is based in the definition of it as 'ekam eva advitiyam' (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1) - it is one without a second and to which no substantive predicates can be attached.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William J. (2005) Ch.3 Nontheistic conceptions of the divine. ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' p.67 OUP, {{ISBN|0-19-513809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, both the [[Chandogya]] and [[Brihadaranyaka]] Upanishads assert that the individual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] and the impersonal Brahman are one.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2004) ''Mysticism and Morality: A New Look at Old Questions'', P. 80, Lexington Books, {{ISBN|0-7391-0784-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahāvākyas|mahāvākya]] statement [[Tat Tvam Asi]], found in the Chandogya Upanishad, can be taken to indicate this unity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L, (1991) ''Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0656-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter Upanishad uses the negative term [[Neti neti]] to 'describe' the divine.
[[File:Patanjali Statue.jpg|270px|thumb|right|[[Patañjali]] statue in Pantanjali Yog Peeth Haridwar]]
Classical [[Samkhya]], [[Mimamsa]], early [[Vaisheshika]] and early [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism do not accept the notion of an omnipotent creator God at all.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James, Ch. Indian Conceptions of Reality and Divinity found in ''A Companion to World Philosophies'' By Eliot Deutsch, Ronald Bontekoe, P. 352, Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-21327-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Kenneth W. and Sarma, D S, Eds. (1953) Ch. 5. P.207 Hindu Religious Thought by Satis Chandra Chatterjee, ''The Religion of the Hindus: Interpreted by Hindus'', Ronald Press. {{ISBN|81-208-0387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Sankhya and Mimamsa schools no longer have significant followings in India, they are both influential in the development of later schools of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'',(p.232) CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James,(1999) ''Classical Samkhya'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|81-208-0503-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga of [[Patanjali]] is the school that probably owes most to the Samkhya thought. This school is dualistic, in the sense that there is a division between 'spirit' (Sanskrit: [[purusha]]) and 'nature' (Sanskrit: [[prakṛti]]).&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1989), ''Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy'', Tarcher, {{ISBN|0-87477-520-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds Samadhi or 'concentrative union' as its ultimate goal&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999) ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought'', p:191, Edinburgh University Press, {{ISBN|0-7486-0954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it does not consider God's existence as either essential or necessary to achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Richard Pauranik, ''Being a Witness in Theory and Practice of Yoga'' by Knut A. Jacobsen&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]], contains passages that bear a monistic reading and others that bear a theistic reading.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith. E., ''On Interpreting the "Bhagavadgītā"'', Philosophy East and West 32, no 1 (January, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the book as a whole has been interpreted by some who see it as containing a primarily nontheistic message,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord''. Routledge Press, 1992, page 45, 98, 115, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and by others who stress its theistic message.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, pages 47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; These broadly either follow after either [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] or [[Ramanuja]]&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', (pps 239-234) CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a nontheistic passage might be "The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being," which Sankara interpreted to mean that Brahman can only be talked of in terms of negation of all attributes—'Neti neti'.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Gambhirananda, (1995), [http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ ''Bhagavadgita: with the Commentary of Sankaracharya''], Ch. 13. Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta {{ISBN|81-7505-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is "Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, John, [http://www.realization.org/page/namedoc0/vc/vc_10.htm ''Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara'' Vs 468.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wainright, William, (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ ''Concepts of God''], Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain texts claim that the universe consists of ''[[jiva]]'' (life force or souls) and [[ajiva]] (lifeless objects). According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents-soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion-have always existed. The universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent [[creator god]]. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/''devas'', but these heavenly beings are not viewed as creators-they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and are portrayed as mortal.

According to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from ''karmas'' and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (''[[Tirthankara]]'').

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also employ [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute [[creationism|creationist]] theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|vedics]], [[samkhya|sāmkhyas]], mimimsas, Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain Ācāryas, such as [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]].

==Satanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Lucien Greaves, the founder of [[the Satanic Temple]], argues that contemporary [[Satanism]] is "the future of religion" insofar as it offers a model for how religious traditions can evolve and be maintained without the need for the supernatural, as cultural and philosophical identities that inform the narratives and the rituals of individuals adherents and communities. His organization challenges the traditional view that [[religion]] must incorporate supernatural claims.

==Others==
Philosophical models not falling within established religious structures, such as [[Daoism]], Confucianism,  [[Deism]] and [[Pandeism]], have also been considered to be nontheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7918">{{about|an emotion|the album|Oceanic Feeling (album)}}
In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, [[Romain Rolland]] coined the phrase "'''oceanic feeling'''" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Roberts |first=Robert |editor=[[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] |title=Emotions in the Christian Tradition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion-Christian-tradition/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |volume=Winter 2016 |date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Freud discusses the feeling in his ''[[The Future of an Illusion|Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf pp. 11–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|letter to Freud]]:

{{quote|''Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la ''sensation'' religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de ''la sensation de l'Eternel'' (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |last=Masson |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Oceanic Feeling. The Origins of Religious Sentiment in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=6 December 2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=vBRnmMts8e4C 1st ed.: 1980] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Mais+j'aurais+aimé+à+vous+voir+faire+l'analyse%22%22de+la+sensation+de+l'Eternel+(qui+peut+très+bien+n'étre+pas+éternel,+mais+simplement+sans+bornes+perceptibles,+et+comme+océanique%22 34] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |id={{ISBN|9-40098969-5}} |isbn=978-9-400-98969-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In strict translation:

{{quote|But I would have liked to see you doing an analysis of ''spontaneous religious sentiment'' or, more exactly, of religious ''feeling'', which is...the simple and direct fact ''of the feeling of the ‘eternal’'' (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William B. |last=Parsons |title=The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling.

Freud ends ''The Future of an Illusion'' with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of ''Civilization and Its Discontents'', answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.

== Freud's explanation ==
Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy.  The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it.  Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist.  Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.

== Neuroscientific explanation ==
{{Main article|Neuroscience of religion}}

"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A. Burton |title=On Being Certain. Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PsYEOdPj78gC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Neurotheology |chapterurl=https://books.google.it/?id=PsYEOdPj78gC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=neurotheology+%22oneness+with+the+universe%22%22awe,+joy+and+a+general+sense+of+harmony+and+deep+significance%22 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]/[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York City |date=5 February 2008}} {{ISBN|1-42992611-2}}; {{ISBN|978-1-429-92611-9}} (Macmillan Publishers edition). {{ISBN|0-31235920-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-312-35920-1}} (St. Martin's Press edition).&lt;/ref&gt; the perception that [[time]], [[fear]] or [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] have dissolved; [[supernatural|spiritual]] awe; [[Monism|oneness]] with the universe; ecstatic [[altered state of consciousness|trance]]; sudden [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; and [[altered states of consciousness]].

What [[Andrew B. Newberg]] and others "discovered is that intensely focused [[meditation|spiritual contemplation]] triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] call ''oneness with the universe''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Newberg, Andrew B. |authorlink=Andrew B.

Serious changes in the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian church]] occurred under the Arab rule, when the Catholicos Nerses I Bakur (688-704) attempted to convert to Chalcedonism, thus recognizing the spiritual authority of [[Constantinople]]. He was deposed by the Grand Duke of Albania Shero and other feudal lords who remained faithful to the Albanian church, and cursed at the national church cathedral. In the second half of the 10th century, the population of the left-bank Albania (Hereti) was included in the sphere of influence of the decision of the Chalcedon Council of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]], adopted in the 7th century and got a great impact of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=catholicosate+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=catholicosate%20albania&amp;f=false|title=From the Gulf to Central Asia: Players in the New Great Game|last=Ehteshami|first=Anoushiravan|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859894517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the territories of [[Transcaucasia]] entered the [[Russian Empire]], the Albanian Catholicos of the church in 1813 by the decree of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] passed into the status of the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolite]] of the Albanian church.

Orthodoxy became wide spread in Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multiculturalism.preslib.az/en_a4.html|title=Azerbaijani Multiculturalism|last=Huseynzadeh|first=Tunjay|website=multiculturalism.preslib.az|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.aliyev-heritage.org/en/7855792.html|title=Welcome to Heydar Aliyevs Heritage Research Center|website=lib.aliyev-heritage.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan nowadays ==
In 1815, the first Russian Orthodox church appeared in [[Baku]]. Later such churches were built in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Goranboy (city)|Goranboy]] (Borisi-Russian village, 1842), [[Shamakhi|Shemakha]] (Alty-Aghadj village, 1834), [[Lankaran]] (Vel village, 1838), and [[Gadabay District|Gedabek]] (Slavyanka village, 1844).

There were 21 sectarian villages in Baku during 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_TraditionReligion/_traditionReligion_e.html|title=Azerbaijan - Religion In Azerbaijan|website=www.azerbaijan.az|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. During the Soviet era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume33/issue2/BlittBoyd33U.Pa.J.Int'lL.363(2011).pdf|title=Religion in USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities repressed the priests of the Baku diocese, but in 1944 two churches were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://myangle.net/en/angle/899-russian-orthodox-church-baku|title=Russian Orthodox Church in Baku|work=MyAngle|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Baku-Caspian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. On March 22, 2011, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was changed to the Baku-Caspian diocese in Baku-Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospat.ru/en/2010/12/25/news33364/|title=Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church takes decisions on external church activities {{!}} The Russian Orthodox Church|website=mospat.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were six Christian Orthodox churches in the country. Five of them belong to the Russian Orthodox church (ROC): three of them are located in Baku one in Ganja and one in [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]].

Another temple belongs to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox Church - the church of [[Saint George|St. George]] in the village of Gakh-Inguila in the [[Qakh District|Qakh district]], where the [[Ingiloy people|Ingiloi]] Georgians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/activity-of-russian-orthodox-church-among-the-muslim-natives-of-the-caucasus-in-imperial-russia/|title=ACTIVITY OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AMONG THE MUSLIM NATIVES OF THE CAUCASUS IN IMPERIAL RUSSIA|date=2010-08-16|work=მატიანე|access-date=2018-05-31|language=ka-GE}}&lt;/ref&gt; live compactly (about 7,500 people).

In 2013, November, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] participated in the opening ceremony of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy. Firstly&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; The President visited the [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/azerbaijani-president-attends-opening-of-orthodox-religious-and-cultural-center-of-baku-and-azerbaijan-eparchy/|title=Azerbaijani President attends opening of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy|date=2013-11-16|work=News {{!}} Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Archangel’s Temple in the capital city Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archangel-mikhail-baku.com/en/about-us/|title=About us – Church of St. Archangel Michael of Baku|website=archangel-mikhail-baku.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Albanian-Udin Christian community ==
In 2001, during his visit to Azerbaijan, Patriarch Alexe II met with representatives of the Udin community who expressed the desire of their people to join the ROC. However, this did not lead to any real results, and the community of Udin remained outside the church's nourishment.

In May 28, 2003, the Albanian-Udin Christian community was established in Azerbaijan. The Chairman of the community was Robert Mobilea. This was due to the restoration of the ancient Kish temple in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] (according to legend, the foundation was laid by the apostle Eliseus). In 2006, the restoration of the second Udin temple, the church in the village of Nijgabalinsky district, was completed. Restoration works are also continued in the village of Gum of the Gakh region and the basilica in the village of Gyumriuk with the intention of restoration of the Albanian basilica which is related to the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai113_folder/113_articles/113_udins_konanchev.html|title=Udins Today - Ancestors of the Caucasian Albanians|last=|first=|date=|website=www.azer.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the bishop of Baku and the Caspian Sea, Alexander (Ishchein), reported that Orthodox worship will be performed in Udin churches, and priests for them are trained in Russian religious schools. The Baku diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church took part in some solemn events, and even held baptisms, but there is no general progress on the involving of Udin into the ROC. Meanwhile, the Albanian-Udin Christian community exists in the form of a separate ethno-religious group with its own ideas about the "Udin Church", in which rituals are conducted not by canonical clergymen, but by the members of the community. In particular, the right to baptize was taken over by the Chairman of the AUHO Robert Mobilea and the self-styled "spiritual figure" Rafik Danakari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baku.ru/blg-list.php?id=103190|title=Baptism in Nij|last=|first=|date=|website=www.baku.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some West Africans were inspired by the [[Indian independence movement]].&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Values and the Educated Class in Africa |first=Ali Al'Amin |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-03292-6 |page=104 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8F6eKRVysC&amp;pg=PA104 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, educated West Africans formed the [[National Congress of British West Africa]], which modeled its name on the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name="chamberlain1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Decolonization: The Fall of the European Empires |first=Muriel Evelyn |last=Chamberlain |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-21602-2 |page=11 |pages= |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYMwBRvtb1UC&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ali Mazrui]], the facet of the Indian independence movement West Africans found most admirable was the Indian peoples' unity during the struggle.&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt; In 1936, [[H. O. Davies]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Africans should follow India &amp;ndash; the only way is for Africans to co-operate and make sacrifices in the struggle for freedom."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ali Mazrui,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the emergence of the Muslim League in India as a serious secessionist movement soon shattered the myth of unity in the Indian model. A new word entered the vocabulary of West African nationalism &amp;ndash; the word was 'pakistanism'."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ghana]]'s [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Nigeria]]'s [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] became concerned about possible Pakistanization.&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Zik: a selection from the speeches of Nnamdi Azikiwe |first=Nnamdi |last=Azikiwe |authorlink=Nnamdi Azikiwe |year=1961 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London |isbn= |page=173 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iec7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention People's Party]]'s 1954 Election Manifesto contain the following message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have seen the tragedy of religious communalism in India and elsewhere. Don't let us give it a chance to take root and flourish in Ghana. Down with Pakistanism!"&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p105"&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Values and the Educated Class in Africa |first=Ali Al'Amin |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |isbn=0-520-03292-6 |page=105 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8F6eKRVysC&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pakistanism became a concern in [[Nigeria]]'s independence movement. The primary subdivisions of Nigeria consisted of the [[Hausa-Fulani]]-dominated [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-dominated [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]], and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-dominated [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. In addition to  these ethnic differences, the Northern Region was primarily [[Muslim]], while the Western and Eastern regions were primarily [[Christian]]. In the 1950s, the Northern Region threatened to secede. [[Godfrey Mwakikagile]] noted that it was the Northern region that was the first region threatening to secede.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria |first=Godfrey |last=Mwakikagile |authorlink=Godfrey Mwakikagile |year=2001 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=Huntington, NY |isbn=1-56072-967-8 |page=4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1950 General Conference at Ibadan, Northern Region delegates demanded 50% of the seat in Nigeria's legislature, and they threatened to secede if this demand was not met.&lt;ref name="mwakikagile1"/&gt; In 1958, Nnamdi Azikiwe said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is essential that ill-will be not created in order to encourage a Pakistan in this country."&lt;ref name="mazrui1-p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azikiwe1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original goal of the counter-coup against the government of [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] on July 29, 1966, was to facilitate the Northern Region's secession from the rest of Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ikein1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oil, democracy, and the Promise of true Federalism in Nigeria |first1=Augustine A. |last1=Ikein |first2=Diepreye S.

In February 2011, Ali Mazrui used the term to describe the division of the [[Sudan]] into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and [[South Sudan]], which is primarily Christian and [[animism|animistic]].&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/sudan-secession-postcolonial-africa |title=Is this Pakistanism in Sudan? |first=Ali |last=Mazrui |authorlink=Ali Mazrui |date=2011-02-09 |work=guardian.co.uk |publisher= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rangfarah''' is the name chosen for a revivalist movement of [[Tangsa]] traditional spirituality. The intention is "to give an alternative form of religious belief to those who were neither following the Christian beliefs nor the traditional ways". "Rangfrah" meaning "God" in the [[Longchang]] dialect was given a form very similar to that of the "[[Shiva]]" of the Hindu religion and a worshiping house called "Rangshom Him" was built to place the Rangfrah idol and make arrangement for the followers to gather and offer their prayers.

In the dialects of other [[Tangsa]] communities, the term for "God" takes variants such as Rangwa, Rangkhothak, etc. Traditionally, the Tangsas rarely practiced any kind of religious rituals dedicated to the God. However, they generally used various ways to invoke spirits to either receive their benevolent influences or to protect themselves from their malevolent activities. The rituals were mostly invocations, which predominantly involved offerings of animals, rice, rice-beer, eggs, etc. wrapped in leaves of a particular plant and then placing them at a sacred location specific to that particular ritual.

The '''Rational Response Squad''', or '''RRS''', is an [[atheist]] activist group that confronts what it considers to be [[irrationality|irrational claims]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Rational Response Squad |url=http://www.rationalresponders.com/hamurookis_irrational_precepts |title=Irrational Precepts page at RationaResponders.com |publisher=Rationalresponders.com |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by [[theists]], particularly [[Christians]]. The most visible member of RRS is co-founder '''Brian Cutler'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Rational Response Squad |url=http://www.rationalresponders.com/our_team |title=The "Our Team" page at RRS |publisher=Rationalresponders.com |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rational Response Squad, along with the filmmaker [[Brian Flemming]], made headlines in December 2006 with their Blasphemy Challenge. However, no new post has been put on their website as of December 2016.

==The Blasphemy Challenge==
The '''Blasphemy Challenge''', started in December 2006, is an Internet-based project which aims to get [[atheist]]s to come out and declare themselves as atheists.&lt;ref name="Newsweek2007"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16409851/site/newsweek/ | title=Beliefwatch: Blasphemy | publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date= January 8, 2006 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604070414/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16409851/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge asks atheists to submit videos to the website [[YouTube]], in which they record themselves [[blasphemy|blaspheming]] or denying the existence of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0104/p13s01-lire.html | title=Atheists challenge the religious right | publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date= January 4, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the RRS' interpretation of several passages of the [[Bible]] (specifically, [[Book of Mark|Mark]] 3:28-29, [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:30-32 and [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 12:10), this action is considered [[unforgivable sin|an unforgivable sin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2833103&amp;page=1 | title=The Blasphemy Challenge | publisher=[[ABC News]] |date= January 30, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, users who took the challenge saw themselves as crossing a [[point of no return]] to prove that they truly did not believe in the biblical [[Abrahamic God|God]] and would "accept the consequences" if after their death they find that the Christian form of the Abrahamic God does exist.&lt;ref name="Newsweek2007"/&gt; The first 1,001 users who took the challenge received a DVD of Flemming's documentary film ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blasphemychallenge.com/ The Blasphemy Challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224081806/http://blasphemychallenge.com/ |date=2006-12-24 }} Official site accessed on February 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Magician [[Penn Jillette]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2INdxjHgU0 |title=Penn Jullette's Blasphemy Challenge entry |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Christopher Hitchens]], philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]],  and [[Raëlism]] founder [[Raël]] participated in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandmediainstitute.org/articles/2007/20070201111038.aspx Blasphemy Redux] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070222021412/http://www.cultureandmediainstitute.org/articles/2007/20070201111038.aspx |date=2007-02-22 }} on Culture and Media Institute accessed on February 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InjgkhwpzJQ Rael takes the Blasphemy Challenge] on YouTube accessed at February 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first YouTube video of comedian and Internet personality [[Pat Condell]].&lt;ref name="freethinkerinterview"&gt;{{cite web| last = McKeegan| first = Dave| title = Laughing religion off the planet - an interview with Pat Condell| publisher = The Freethinker| date = 2008-02-27| url = http://freethinker.co.uk/2008/02/27/laughing-religion-off-the-planet-an-interview-with-pat-condell/| accessdate =2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from Christians===
Some Christian groups responded to the Challenge with "Challenge Blasphemy" and the "Praise the Lord Challenge".&lt;ref name="csnnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200702/CUL20070205a.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120538/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/viewstory.asp?Page=%2FCulture%2Farchive%2F200702%2FCUL20070205a.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |title=Blasphemy Site 'Playing Texas Hold 'Em With Eternity' |last=Bansal |first=Monisha |date=2007-02-05 |publisher=CNSNews |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those projects are designed to directly counter the Blasphemy Challenge by encouraging individuals to show their faith in [[Jesus Christ]] by posting videos of themselves praising God, or praying by name for the members of the Rational Response Squad or users participating in the Blasphemy Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-youth-challenge-youtube-blasphemy-25385/ |title=Christian Youth Challenge YouTube Blasphemy |last=Kwon |first=Lillian |date=2007-01-24 |work=The Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==YouTube controversies==
{{wikinews|Judge dismisses copyright lawsuit against Uri Geller}}

The Rational Response Squad's YouTube account was suspended on March 23, 2007 but was later reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/sapient/news_activism/5637 "Rational Squad deleted from Youtube"]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the suspension was due to [[Uri Geller]] claiming that Rational Response Squad had infringed his copyrights when posting a video featuring him.

On May 8, 2007 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] filed suit against Uri Geller in Philadelphia on behalf of Brian Sapient "asking for damages due to Geller's violation of the [[DMCA]], a declaratory judgment that the ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' video does not infringe Geller's copyrights, and that Geller be restrained from bringing any further legal action against Sapient in connection to the clip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/sapient_v_geller/ | title=Sapient v. Geller | publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date = May 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2008 a judgement was reached and "As part of the legal settlement, Explorologist[Geller] has agreed to license the disputed footage under a non-commercial Creative Commons license, preempting future legal battles over the fair use of the material. A monetary settlement was also reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/08/sapient-and-explorologist-settle-lawsuit | title=Sapient and Explorologist Settle Lawsuit | publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date = August 2008| first= | last=  | accessdate =2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller brought a separate case in California and it was dismissed by Chief Judge Walker in February 2008, due to "lack of subject matter and personal jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.judicialview.com/Court-Cases/Copyright/DMCA-Doesnt-Confer-Personal-Jurisdiction/Activist-Can-Pursue-Claim-Against-Psychic-Via-Long-Arm-Statute/55/2606 | title=DMCA Doesn't Confer Personal Jurisdiction| publisher=Judicial view LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|American evangelist claims copyright on public domain videos|date=September 20, 2007}}

On September 16, 2007, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine reported that "[[YouTube]] had banned a group called the Rational Response Squad (RRS) after it complained its videos were being taken down due to spurious DMCA requests from" someone working on behalf of the [[Creation Science Evangelism]] ministry. It further noted that while this highlights problems with [[DMCA]], the ministry's own website said that "''none of the materials ... are copyrighted, so feel free to copy these and distribute them freely''."&lt;ref name="WiredHovind"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/youtube-support.html | title=YouTube Supports "Fraudulent" Creationist DMCA Claim | publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date= September 28, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the claims, the RRS posted a message that it is ready to help sue CSE and/or [[Kent Hovind|Eric Hovind]].&lt;ref name="RRS"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/rational_response_squad_alerts/rational_response_squad_alerts/9978 | title=We're Ready to Help Sue Creation Science Evangelism | publisher=Rational Response Squad |date= September 14, 2007 | first= | last= |accessdate =2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account was restored on September 18, 2007.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Debate with The Way of the Master==

Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Connor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Rational Response Squad |url=http://www.rationalresponders.com/dsouza_nothing_to_refute_here |title=O'Connor, Kelly; "D'Souza - Nothing to Refute Here" rationalresponders.com; November 8, 2007 |publisher=Rationalresponders.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the RRS, participated in a debate with representatives from [[The Way of the Master]], actor and evangelical Christian [[Kirk Cameron]], and his colleague [[Ray Comfort]], at [[Calvary Baptist Church (Manhattan, New York)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[Manhattan]] on May 5, 2007. ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' aired the debate online and included a short two-segment summary on its May 9 broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1229854964003619354 |title=Face-Off - Does God Exist - Part1 on Google Video |publisher=Video.google.com |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At issue was the existence of God.  ''Nightline'' correspondent [[Martin Bashir]] served as moderator at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3148940&amp;page=1 |title=Bashir, Martin; "Prepare for a Conflict: The Nightline 'Face-Off' No-Holds Barred Battle Over the Existence of God"; May 7, 2007 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cameron and Comfort challenged the Rational Response Squad to the debate. They claimed that they could prove the existence of God scientifically without using the Bible, though Comfort does refer to the Bible when he participates in such discussions,&lt;ref name="qualifier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070429/27149_Evangelist_Challenges_Atheists_to_Debate_on_ABC.htm |title=Correction to article; "Evangelist Challenges Atheists to Debate on ABC"; April 29, 2007 |publisher=Christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did so during the May 5 debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-rKiGJrcNw&amp;mode=related&amp;search= |title=Video of Comfort's opening arguments at the May 5, 2007 debate, in which he references the Bible beginning at the 2:58 mark |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a May 8, 2007 clarification, Comfort stated that he would cease using the qualifier "without mentioning faith or the Bible" from his claims to avoid misunderstandings.&lt;ref name="qualifier"/&gt;

During the debate, both sides employed and responded to arguments for God's existence, including the [[cosmological argument]] and [[Pascal's Wager]]. The debate also entered topics outside of [[science]], including [[history]], and the question of connections between religion and [[morality]].

{{Culture of Korea}}

'''Religion in Korea''' refers the various religious traditions practiced on the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. The oldest indigenous religion of [[Korea]] is [[Korean shamanism]], which has been passed down from prehistory to the present.{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=41}} [[Buddhism]] was introduced to Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era in the 4th century, and the religion flourished until the [[Joseon]] Dynasty, when [[Korean Confucianism]] became the state religion.{{sfnp|Encyclopaedia Britannica|2008|p=162}} During the Late Joseon Dynasty, in the 19th century, [[Christianity]] began to gain a foothold in Korea.{{sfnp|Kim|2012}} While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century,{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=xv}} only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Sense of the Secular: Critical Perspectives from Europe to Asia|last=Baker|first=Don|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1136277214|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Ranjan|location=|pages=182–193|chapter=Korea's Path of Secularisation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v7ipRmW6M0C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=page182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[division of Korea]] into two sovereign states in 1945—[[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]—religious life in the two countries has diverged, shaped by different political structures. [[Religion in South Korea]] has been characterized by a rise of Christianity and a revival of Buddhism, though the majority of South Koreans have [[Irreligion in South Korea|no religious affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCBe9w9C2UkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Korean Spirituality|last=Baker|first=Donald L.|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0824832339|location=|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&amp;tblId=DT_1PM1502&amp;conn_path=I2|title=성, 연령 및 종교별 인구 - 시군구|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Korean Statistical Information Service|language=ko|trans-title=Population by Gender, Age, and Religion - City/Country|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion in North Korea]] is characterized by [[state atheism]] in which [[Freedom of religion in North Korea|freedom of religion]] is nonexistent.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Religion in Ancient Rome''' includes the ancestral [[ethnic religion]] of the [[city of Rome]] that the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] used to define themselves as a people, as well as the religious practices of peoples brought under Roman rule, in so far as they became widely followed in Rome and Italy. The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining [[pax deorum|good relations with the gods]]. The Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early [[Christian polemic]]ists.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the representation of Roman religion in early Christian authors, see R.P.C. Hanson, "The Christian Attitue to Pagan Religions up to the Time of Constantine the Great" and Carlos A. Contreras, "Christian Views of Paganism" in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.23.1 (1980) 871–1022.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and [[Roman art]], as the Etruscans had. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of [[augury]]. According to [[legend]]s, most of Rome's religious institutions could be traced to its [[founding of Rome|founders]], particularly [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Sabine]] second [[king of Rome]], who negotiated directly with [[Ancient Roman gods|the gods]]. This archaic religion was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', "the way of the ancestors" or simply "tradition", viewed as central to Roman identity.

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', "I give that you might give". Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although [[Latin literature]] preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as [[Cicero]], who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order.  As the [[Roman Empire]] expanded, migrants to the capital brought their local cults, many of which became popular among Italians.  Christianity was in the end the most successful of these, and in 380 became the official state religion.

For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]], who tended [[Sacred_fire_of_Vesta|Rome's sacred hearth]] for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.

== Overview ==
The priesthoods of public religion were held by members of the [[Social class in ancient Rome|elite classes]]. There was no principle analogous to [[separation of church and state]] in ancient Rome. During the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC), the same men who were [[Roman Magistrates|elected public officials]] might also serve as [[augur]]s and [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]]. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. [[Julius Caesar]] became [[pontifex maximus]] before he was elected [[Roman consul|consul]].

The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman [[expansionism]] as a matter of divine destiny. The [[Roman triumph]] was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], who embodied just rule. As a result of the [[Punic Wars]] (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new [[Roman temple|temples]] were built by magistrates in [[votum|fulfillment of a vow]] to a deity for assuring their military success.

As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the [[Mediterranean]] world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them,&lt;ref&gt;"This mentality," notes John T. Koch, "lay at the core of the genius of cultural assimilation which made the Roman Empire possible"; entry on "Interpretatio romana" in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.&lt;/ref&gt; since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome", p. 4; Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; W.H.C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 261. See, for instance, the altar dedicated by a Roman citizen and depicting a sacrifice conducted in the Roman manner for the Germanic goddess [[Vagdavercustis]] in the 2nd century CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the height of the Empire, numerous [[interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]], among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Epona]], and gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]].  Foreign religions increasingly attracted devotees among Romans, who increasingly had ancestry from elsewhere in the Empire. Imported [[mystery religions]], which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of "[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]", conspiratorial (''coniuratio''), or subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[monotheism|monotheistic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State", ''Classical Philology'' 81.4 (1986) 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt; The monotheistic rigor of [[Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict. For example, religious disputes helped cause the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].

In the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new [[Roman emperor|regime of the emperors]]. [[Augustus]], the first Roman emperor, justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. [[Votum#Public vota|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the well-being of the emperor. So-called "emperor worship" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] became one of the major ways in which Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason. This was the context for Rome's conflict with [[Early Christianity|Christianity]], which Romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#superstitio|superstitio]]''. Ultimately, Roman polytheism was brought to an end with the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire.

== Founding myths and divine destiny ==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Relief]] panel from an altar to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] depicting Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf, and gods representing Roman topography such as the [[Tiber]] and [[Palatine Hill]]]]
{{See also|Roman mythology|Founding of Rome}}
The [[Roman mythology|Roman mythological tradition]] is particularly rich in historical myths, or [[legend]]s, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. For Rome's earliest period, history and myth are difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Grandazzi]], ''The Foundation of Rome: Myth and History'' (Cornell University Press, 1997), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to mythology, Rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the [[Trojan War|Trojan]] refugee [[Aeneas]], son of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], who was said to have established the nucleus of Roman religion when he brought the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] from Troy to Italy. These objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]], Rome's female priesthood. Aeneas, according to classical authors, had been given refuge by King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], a Greek exile from [[Arcadia]], to whom were attributed other religious foundations: he established the ''[[Ara Maxima]]'', "Greatest Altar", to [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]] at the site that would become the [[Forum Boarium]], and, so the legend went, he was the first to celebrate the [[Lupercalia]], an archaic festival in February that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the Christian era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 1; 189 – 90 (Aeneas and Vesta): 123 – 45 (Aeneas and Venus as Julian ancestors). See also Vergil,'' ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of a Trojan founding with Greek influence was reconciled through an elaborate genealogy (the [[Latin kings of Alba Longa]]) with the well-known legend of Rome's founding by [[Romulus and Remus]]. The most common version of the twins' story displays several aspects of hero myth. Their mother, [[Rhea Silvia]], had been ordered by her uncle the king to remain a virgin, in order to preserve the throne he had usurped from her father. Through divine intervention, the rightful line was restored when Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. She gave birth to twins, who were duly [[child exposure|exposed]] by order of the king but saved through a series of miraculous events.

Romulus and Remus regained their grandfather's throne and set out to build a new city, consulting with the gods through [[augury]], a characteristic religious institution of Rome that is portrayed as existing from earliest times. The brothers quarrel while building the city walls, and Romulus kills Remus, an act that is sometimes seen as sacrificial. Fratricide thus became an integral part of Rome's founding myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romulus was credited with several religious institutions. He founded the [[Consualia]] festival, inviting the neighbouring [[Sabines]] to participate; the ensuing [[rape of the Sabine women]] by Romulus's men further embedded both violence and cultural assimilation in Rome's myth of origins. As a successful general, Romulus is also supposed to have founded Rome's first temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)#Epithets of Jupiter|Jupiter Feretrius]] and offered the ''[[spolia opima]]'', the prime spoils taken in war, in the celebration of the first [[Roman triumph]]. Spared a mortal's death, Romulus was mysteriously spirited away and deified.&lt;ref&gt;Or else was murdered by his resentful senate, who successfully concealed their crime. See Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 1; Vol. 2, 4.8a for Livy, 1.9 &amp; 5 – 7 (Sabines and temple to Jupiter) and Plutarch, ''Romulus'', 11, 1 – 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aeneis 3 147.jpeg|thumb|left|Aeneas urged by the Penates to continue his journey to found Rome (4th century AD illustration)&lt;ref&gt;Illustration of Vergil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.147; MS Vat. lat. 3225, folio 28 recto&lt;/ref&gt;]]
His Sabine successor [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] was pious and peaceable, and credited with numerous political and religious foundations, including the first [[Roman calendar]]; the priesthoods of the [[Salii]], [[Flamen|flamines]], and Vestals; the cults of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Mars, and [[Quirinus]]; and the Temple of [[Janus]], whose doors stayed open in times of war but in Numa's time remained closed. After Numa's death, the doors to the Temple of Janus were supposed to have remained open until the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 1 – 2 &amp; Vol. 2: 1.2, (Livy, 1.19.6): 8.4a (Plutarch, Numa, 10). For Augustus' closure of Janus's temple doors, see Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae]]'', 13. Festus connects Numa to the triumphal ''[[spolia opima]]'' and Jupiter Feretrius.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Rome's legendary or semi-legendary kings was associated with one or more religious institutions still known to the later Republic. [[Tullus Hostilius]] and [[Ancus Marcius]] instituted the [[fetial]] priests. The first "outsider" Etruscan king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], founded a [[Capitoline Triad|Capitoline temple to the triad]] Jupiter, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] which served as the model for the highest official cult throughout the Roman world. The benevolent, divinely fathered [[Servius Tullius]] established the [[Latin League]], its [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] Temple to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and the [[Compitalia]] to mark his social reforms. Servius Tullius was murdered and succeeded by the arrogant [[Tarquinius Superbus]], whose expulsion marked the beginning of Rome as a republic with annually elected [[Roman magistrates|magistrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 3, and footnotes 4 &amp; 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman historiography|Roman historians]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] places Rome's foundation more than 600 years before his own time. His near contemporary [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] appear to share some common sources, including an earlier history by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]], of which only a terse summary survives. See also [[Diocles of Peparethus]], [[Romulus and Remus]] and Plutarch, ''The Parallel Lives, Life of Romulus'', 3. Loeb edn. available at Thayer's site: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html]. Fragments of an important earlier work (now lost) of [[Quintus Ennius]] are cited by various later Roman authors. On the chronological problems of the kings' list, see Cornell, pp. 21–26, and 199–122.&lt;/ref&gt; regarded the essentials of Republican religion as complete by the end of Numa's reign, and confirmed as right and lawful by the [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]]: the sacred [[Topography of ancient Rome|topography of the city]], its monuments and temples, the histories of Rome's [[gens|leading families]], and oral and ritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 8-10; Cornell, pp. 1–30; Feeney, in Rüpke (ed), 129 – 42, on religious themes in Roman Historiography and epic; Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 31 – 42 for broad discussion of sources, modern schools of thought and divergent interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, the Romans considered themselves the most religious of all peoples, and their rise to dominance was proof they received divine favor in return.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''On the Responses of the Haruspices'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman deities ==
{{See also|List of Roman deities}}
[[File:Altar twelve gods Louvre Ma666.jpg|thumb|Twelve principal deities ''([[Di Consentes]])'' corresponding to those honored at the [[lectisternium]] of 217 BC, represented on a 1st-century altar from [[Gabii]] that is rimmed by the [[zodiac]]]]
Rome offers no native [[creation myth]], and little [[mythography]] to explain the character of its deities, their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human world, but Roman theology acknowledged that ''di immortales'' (immortal gods) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth. There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults. At different times and in different places, the sphere of influence, character and functions of a divine being could expand, overlap with those of others, and be redefined as Roman. Change was embedded within existing traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed) 4 and Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 10 – 43; in particular, 30 – 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions of a semi-official, structured [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] were developed during the political, social and religious instability of the Late Republican era. [[Jupiter (mythology)#Cult|Jupiter]], the most powerful of all gods and "the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested", consistently personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared [[Capitoline Triad|his temple]], some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], who were later replaced by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;The reasons for this change remain unclear, though they are attributed to Etruscan influence. For a summary of Jupiter's complex development from the Regal to Republican eras, see Beard ''et al.,'', Vol. 1, 59 – 60. Jupiter's image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours. Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus were collectively and individually associated with Rome's agricultural economy, social organisation and success in war.&lt;/ref&gt; A conceptual tendency toward [[Triadic deities|triads]] may be indicated by the later agricultural or [[plebs|plebeian]] triad of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]], and by some of the complementary threefold deity-groupings of Imperial cult.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 134 – 5, 64 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled, or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure. These later Roman [[pantheism|pantheistic]] hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and often Greek in origin. The [[Hellenization]] of Latin literature and [[Culture of ancient Rome|culture]] supplied literary and artistic models for [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreting]] Roman deities in light of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Olympians]], and promoted a sense that the two cultures had a shared heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58. For related conceptual and interpretive difficulties offered by Roman deities and their cults, see Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed) 1 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tellus - Ara Pacis.jpg|left|upright=1.25|thumb|Three goddesses on a panel of the Augustan [[Ara Pacis]], consecrated in 9 BC; the iconography is open to multiple interpretations]]

The impressive, costly, and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered in everyday life by commonplace religious observances pertaining to an individual's domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Rome's various [[Vicus (Rome)|neighborhoods]] and communities, and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 4 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this spirit, a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from [[Bordeaux]] to Italy to consult the [[Tiburtine Sibyl|Sibyl at Tibur]] did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I wander, never ceasing to pass through the whole world, but I am first and foremost a faithful worshiper of [[Onuava]]. I am at the ends of the earth, but the distance cannot tempt me to make my vows to another goddess. Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava's favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.''&lt;ref&gt;CIL 13.581, quotation from Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Greco-Roman Mystery Cults ==
Throughout the life of Rome, a numerous array of "mystery cults" appeared. These cults were generally founded upon legends or sacred stories, such as the tale of Orpheus. Several had a basis in other cultures, such as the Cult of Isis, and Egyptian goddess. The members generally knew the stories were pure legend, but they provided a model for their followers to obey. These cults had often expensive, long, or trying initiation processes, which differed between cults, but prospective members were promised with a path to a better atmosphere and an atmosphere that fostered social bonds, known as ''mystai''. These bonds were generated due to the fact that most of these cults regularly practiced common meals among members, dances, ceremonies and rituals, and the aforementioned initiations. The focus of the cult, such as the focus on Orpheus among Orphic cults, did not necessarily dictate the theology of its members. The legendary tales were meant to guide members, but the deities involved tended to be a lesser focus. Mystery cults were present and generally accepted throughout much of Rome and provided a unique theological experience for their members. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/myst/hd_myst.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/mystery-religion&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holidays and festivals ==
{{See also|Roman festivals|Fasti|Roman calendar|Ludi|Roman triumph}}
Roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals. Some lasted several days, others a single day or less: sacred days (''dies [[fasti]]'') outnumbered "non-sacred" days (''dies [[nefasti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., 6 – 7; those titled in capital letters on Roman calendars were probably more important and ancient than those titled in small letters: it is not known how ancient they were, nor to whom they were important. Their attribution to Numa or Romulus is doubtful. The oldest surviving religious calendars date to the late Republic; the most detailed are Augustan and later. Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 6: a selection of festivals is given in Vol. 2, 3.1 – 3. For a list of Fasti, with bibliography and sources, see Degrassi, ''Inscriptiones Italiae, Vol. XIII – Fasti et elogia, fasc. II – Fasti anni Numani et Iuliani,'' Rome, 1963. See also Scullard, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions. Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ''[[ludi]]'' ("games", such as [[chariot races]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical performances]]), with examples including those held at [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia]] during [[Compitalia]], and the [[Ludi Romani]] in honour of [[Liber]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol. 1, 134 – 5, 64 – 67: citing Cicero.&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes,&lt;ref&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular groups, such as women at the [[Bona Dea]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 47 – 49, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Compitalia fresco.jpg|right|300px|thumb|This [[fresco]] from outside [[Pompeii]] shows Roman men celebrating a religious festival, probably the [[Compitalia]]]]
Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The [[Roman triumph|triumph]] of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of [[votum|religious vows]], though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ''ludi'' attendant on a triumph were expanded to include [[Gladiator#Origins|gladiator]] contests. Under the [[Principate]], all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican [[Secular Games]] to mark a new era (''saeculum''), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in [[late antiquity]] is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and origin of many archaic festivals baffled even Rome's intellectual elite, but the more obscure they were, the greater the opportunity for reinvention and reinterpretation – a fact lost neither on Augustus in his program of religious reform, which often cloaked autocratic innovation, nor on his only rival as mythmaker of the era, [[Ovid]]. In his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman [[antiquarian]] lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous;&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 2, 6.4a; Vol. 1, 174 – 6 &amp; 207 – 8.&lt;/ref&gt; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a ''[[vates]]'' or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the [[Saturnalia]], [[Consualia]], and feast of [[Anna Perenna]] on the [[Ides of March]], where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), ''passim''; "Transgressive Acts: Ovid's Treatment of the Ides of March", ''Classical Philology'' 91.4 (1996) 320-338.&lt;/ref&gt; But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (AD 354), cited in Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 250, and that of [[Polemius Silvius]]. See also early and later Christian festivals in Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 378 – 80, 382 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temples and shrines ==
[[File:Sanlorenzoinmiranda-rome.jpg|thumb|Portico of the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina]], later incorporated into a church]]
{{Main|Roman temple}}
Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors, and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|Sacrifices]], chiefly [[animal sacrifice|of animals]], would take place at an open-air [[altar]] within the ''templum'' or precinct, often to the side of the steps leading up to the raised portico.  The main room ''(cella)'' inside a temple housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a small altar for incense or [[libation]]s. It might also display art works looted in war and rededicated to the gods.  It is not clear how accessible the interiors of temples were to the general public.

The Latin word ''[[:wikt:templum|templum]]'' originally referred not to the temple building itself, but to a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually through augury: "The architecture of the ancient Romans was, from first to last, an art of shaping space around ritual."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 1, citing Frank E. Brown, ''Roman Architecture'', (New York) 1961, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] always uses the word ''templum'' to refer to this sacred precinct, and the more common Latin words ''[[:wikt:aedes|aedes]]'', ''[[:wikt:delubrum|delubrum]]'', or ''[[:wikt:fanum|fanum]]'' for a temple or shrine as a building. The ruins of temples are among the most visible monuments of ancient Roman culture.

Temple buildings and shrines within the city commemorated significant political settlements in its development: the Aventine Temple of Diana supposedly marked the founding of the Latin League under Servius Tullius.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, et al., Vol. 1, 321 – 3&lt;/ref&gt; Many temples in the Republican era were built as the fulfillment of a [[votum|vow]] made by a general in exchange for a victory.

== Religious practice ==

=== Prayers, vows, and oaths ===
All sacrifices and offerings required an accompanying prayer to be effective. [[Pliny the Elder]] declared that "a sacrifice without prayer is thought to be useless and not a proper consultation of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 28.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer by itself, however, had independent power. The spoken word was thus the single most potent religious action, and knowledge of the correct verbal formulas the key to efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 235–236 ''et passim''. The Roman belief in the power of the word may be reflected also in the importance of persuasive speech, formally oratory, in political life and the law courts.&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate naming was vital for tapping into the desired powers of the deity invoked, hence the proliferation of cult epithets among Roman deities.&lt;ref name="Halm, in Rüpke ed, 241 – 2"&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 241 – 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Public prayers (''[[:wikt:prex|prex]]'') were offered loudly and clearly by a priest on behalf of the community. Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 239 – 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Livy]] reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the [[Feriae Latinae|Latin festival]] forgot to include the "Roman people" among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 41.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even private prayer by an individual was formulaic, a recitation rather than a personal expression, though selected by the individual for a particular purpose or occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 235 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oaths—sworn for the purposes of business, [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientage and service, patronage and protection]], state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities. Refusal to swear a lawful oath ''([[sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]])'' and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine.&lt;ref name="Halm, in Rüpke ed, 241 – 2" /&gt; A ''[[votum]]'' or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.

=== Sacrifice ===
[[File:Stockholm - Antikengalerie Opferszene.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Roman [[relief sculpture|relief]] depicting a scene of sacrifice, with [[libation#Ancient Rome|libations]] at a flaming altar and the ''[[victimarius]]'' carrying the sacrificial axe]]
In Latin, the word ''[[:wikt:sacrificium|sacrificium]]'' means the performance of an act that renders something ''[[:wikt:sacer|sacer]]'', sacred. Sacrifice reinforced the powers and attributes of divine beings, and inclined them to render benefits in return (the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'').

Offerings to [[household deity|household deities]] were part of daily life. [[Lares]] might be offered spelt wheat and grain-garlands, grapes and first fruits in due season, honey cakes and honeycombs, wine and incense,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; food that fell to the floor during any family meal,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 28, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; or at their [[Compitalia]] festival, honey-cakes and a pig on behalf of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, 31: Dionysius of Halicarnassus claims the Compitalia contribution of honey-cakes as a Servian institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant [[Lemures]], might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', 2.500 – 539. See also Thaniel, G., Lemures and Larvae, ''The American Journal of Philology'', 94.2, (1973) 182–187: the offering of black beans is distinctively [[chthonic]]. Beans were considered seeds of life. Lemures may have been the restless dead who had not passed into the underworld, and still craved the life they had lost. Beans were a ritual pollution for Jupiter's priesthood, possibly because his offerings must be emasculated and thus devoid of generative power.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
{{further|October Horse|Tauromachy|Taurobolium|Haruspicy}}
The most potent offering was [[animal sacrifice]], typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the [[pax deorum|harmonisation of the earthly and divine]], so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (''di superi'', "gods above") was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] a white heifer (possibly a white cow); [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] a white, castrated ox (''bos mas'') for the annual oath-taking by the [[Roman consul|consuls]]. ''Di superi'' with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'' – including the Emperor's – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (''[[exta]]'', the innards). Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271"&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263 – 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AUGUSTUS RIC I 368-711372.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Denarius]] issued under Augustus, with a bust of Venus on the [[obverse]], and ritual implements on the reverse: clockwise from top right, the augur's staff ''([[lituus]])'', libation bowl ''([[patera]])'', [[sacrificial tripod|tripod]], and ladle ''([[simpulum]])'']]
[[Chthonic]] gods such as [[Dis pater]], the ''[[di inferi]]'' ("gods below"), and the collective shades of the departed ''([[Manes|di Manes]])'' were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as "the living cannot share a meal with the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Though the household Lares do just that, and at least some Romans understood them to be ancestral spirits. Sacrifices to the spirits of deceased mortals are discussed below in [[Religion in ancient Rome#Funerals and the afterlife|Funerals and the afterlife]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] was given a pregnant cow at the [[Fordicidia]] festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. [[Robigo]] (or [[Robigus]]) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the [[Robigalia]] for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271" /&gt;

{{anchor|piaculum}}
A sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an [[expiation]] of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (''[[:wikt:piaculum|piaculum]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 81 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcsynr0fQIoC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
a ''piaculum'' might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the [[Arval Brethren]], for instance, offered a ''piaculum'' before entering their [[sacred grove]] with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
The pig was a common victim for a ''piaculum''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464 L, or the Hazards of Interpretation", in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 99, note 129 [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEtE8c1jGY4C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online]; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=EB4fB0inNYEC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=piaculum&amp;lr=&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=piaculum&amp;f=false online.] The [[Augustus|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] (8.9.1–11) says [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|P. Decius Mus]] is "like" a ''piaculum'' when he makes his vow to sacrifice himself in battle (''[[devotio]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, in Rüpke (ed), 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the [[Second Punic War]], Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ''[[ver sacrum]]''), to be rendered after five more years of protection from [[Hannibal]] and his allies.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following [[Trajan]]'s death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21: but this need not imply sacrifice as a mutual contract, breached in this instance. Evidently the gods had the greater power and freedom of choice in the matter. See Beard et al., 34: "The gods would accept as sufficient exactly what they were offered – no more, no less." Human error in the previous annual vows and sacrifice remains a possibility.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pompeii]], the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 78, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Exta}}
The ''exta'' were the entrails of a [[animal sacrifice|sacrificed animal]], comprising in [[Cicero]]'s enumeration the gall bladder (''fel''), liver (''iecur''), heart (''cor''), and lungs (''pulmones'').&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De divinatione'' 2.12.29. According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Natural History'' 11.186), before 274 BC the heart was not included among the ''exta''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''exta'' were exposed for [[litatio]] (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were "read" in the context of the ''[[disciplina Etrusca]]''. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the ''exta'' and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat ''(viscera)'' is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The ''exta'' of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (''[[Olla (Roman pot)|olla]]'' or ''aula''), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with ''[[mola salsa]]'' (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was ''[[:wikt:porricere|porricere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "The Roman Religion", in ''Historia Religionum: Religions of the Past'' (Brill, 1969), vol. 1, pp. 471–472, and "Roman Sacrifice", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 79; [[John Scheid]], ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003, originally published in French 1998), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human sacrifice ====
Human sacrifice in ancient Rome was rare but documented. After the [[Battle of Cannae|Roman defeat at Cannae]] two Gauls and two Greeks were buried under the [[Forum Boarium]], in a stone chamber "which had on a previous occasion [228 BC] also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings".&lt;ref&gt;Livy 22.55-57&lt;/ref&gt; Livy avoids the word "sacrifice" in connection with this bloodless human life-offering; Plutarch does not. The rite was apparently repeated in 113 BC, preparatory to an invasion of Gaul. Its religious dimensions and purpose remain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.57.4; Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'', 83 &amp; ''Marcellus'', 3. For further context and interpretive difficulties, see Beard et al., Vol. 1, 81: the live burial superficially resembles the punishment of Vestals who broke their vows. A living entombment assuages the blood-guilt of the living: the guilty are consigned to earth deities. But the Vestals are entombed outside the city limits, not its centre; no sacrificial victims are burned in either case, and the Gauls and Greeks appear to be personally guiltless.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the [[First Punic War]] (264 BC) the first known Roman [[gladiator]]ial ''munus'' was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the ''[[manes]]'' of a Roman military aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 18-19: citing Livy, summary 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The gladiator ''munus'' was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the ''di manes'' or other gods. The event was therefore a ''sacrificium'' in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Prudentius]], ''Contra Symmachum'' 1.379–398; see Donald G. Kyle, ''Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The small woollen dolls called ''Maniae'', hung on the Compitalia shrines, were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to [[Mother of the Lares|Mania, as Mother of the Lares]]. The [[Junii]] took credit for its abolition by their ancestor [[Lucius Junius Brutus|L. Junius Brutus]], traditionally Rome's Republican founder and first consul.&lt;ref&gt;The sacrifice was demanded by an oracle during the reign of the last king, the Etruscan [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. See Macrobius, Saturnalia, 1.7 &amp; Lilly Ross Taylor, "The Mother of the Lares", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', '''29'''.3, (July – September 1925), pp 299 – 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice, whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses; [[Marcus Marius Gratidianus]] was a gruesome example.

Officially, human sacrifice was obnoxious "to the laws of gods and men". The practice was a mark of the [[barbarian]]s, attributed to Rome's traditional enemies such as the Carthaginians and Gauls. Rome banned it on several occasions under extreme penalty. A law passed in 81 BC characterised human sacrifice as murder committed for magical purposes. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] saw the ending of human sacrifice conducted by the [[druid]]s as a positive consequence of the conquest of Gaul and Britain. Despite an empire-wide ban under [[Hadrian]], human sacrifice may have continued covertly in [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 233 – 4, 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic and private cult ===
[[File:Vindobona Hoher Markt-142.JPG|thumb|Small bronze statues of gods for a ''lararium'' (1st to 3rd century AD, [[Vindobona]])]]

The ''mos maiorum'' established the dynastic authority and obligations of the citizen-''paterfamilias'' ("the father of the family" or the "owner of the family estate"). He had priestly duties to his ''[[lares]]'', domestic ''[[penates]]'', ancestral ''Genius'' and any other deities with whom he or his family held an interdependent relationship. His own dependents, who included his slaves and freedmen, owed cult to his ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 36-8: the ''paterfamilias'' held – in theory at least, and through ancient right – powers of life and death over every member of his extended ''familia'', including children, slaves and freedmen. In practice, the extreme form of this right was seldom exercised, and was eventually limited by law.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Severy, 9-10 for interpretation of the social, economic and religious role of the ''paterfamilias'' within the immediate and extended family and the broader community.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Genius'' was the essential spirit and generative power – depicted as a serpent or as a perennial youth, often winged – within an individual and their clan ([[gens]] (pl. ''gentes''). A ''paterfamilias'' could confer his name, a measure of his ''genius'' and a role in his household rites, obligations and honours upon those he fathered or adopted. His freed slaves owed him similar obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', vol 1, 67-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''pater familias'' was the senior priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his ''lares'' and ''penates'', and to his ''di parentes''/''divi parentes'' at his domestic shrines and in the fires of the household hearth.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife (''mater familias'') was responsible for the household's cult to Vesta. In rural estates, bailiffs seem to have been responsible for at least some of the household shrines (lararia) and their deities. Household cults had state counterparts. In Vergil's ''Aeneid'', Aeneas brought the Trojan cult of the ''[[lares]]'' and ''[[penates]]'' from Troy, along with the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] which was later installed in the temple of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', 1997, 2-3, citing Vergil, ''Aeneid'', 8,306-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Religio'' and the state ==
&lt;!--'RELIGIO' is italicized above because it's the Latin word, which the section defines; please don't change to "religion"--&gt;
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Portrait d'Antonin le Pieux 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (reigned 138–161 AD) in ritual attire as an [[Arval Brothers|Arval Brother]]]]
Roman ''[[:wikt:religio#Latin|religio]]'' (religion) was an everyday and vital affair, a cornerstone of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', Roman tradition or ancestral custom.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Care for the gods, the very meaning of ''religio'', had therefore to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was "necessary". Religious behavior – ''pietas'' in Latin, ''eusebeia'' in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. 'When pious travelers happen to pass by a [[lucus|sacred grove]] or a cult place on their way, they are used to make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to sit down for a while' ([[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1).&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, (verbatim) in Rüpke (ed), 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Religious law centered on the ritualised system of honours and sacrifice that brought divine blessings, according to the principle ''[[do ut des]]'' ("I give, that you might give"). Proper, respectful ''religio'' brought social harmony and prosperity. Religious neglect was a form of [[atheism]]: impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were ''[[vitium|vitia]]'' (impious errors). Excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were ''[[Religion in ancient Rome#Divination, magic and superstition|superstitio]]''. Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (''ira deorum'') and therefore harm the State.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The official deities of the state were identified with its lawful offices and institutions, and Romans of every class were expected to honour the beneficence and protection of mortal and divine superiors. Participation in public rites showed a personal commitment to their community and its values.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 3, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official cults were state funded as a "matter of public interest" (''[[res publica]]''). Non-official but lawful cults were funded by private individuals for the benefit of their own communities. The difference between public and private cult is often unclear. Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities. The public Vestals prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults, and held the state-funded (thus public) opening ceremony for the [[Parentalia]] festival, which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors. Some rites of the ''domus'' (household) were held in public places but were legally defined as ''privata'' in part or whole. All cults were ultimately subject to the approval and regulation of the censor and ''pontifices''.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 9-15: citing legal definitions from Festus (epitome of Verrius Flaccus) "De verborum significatu" p.284 L: in Wissowa, 1912, 398ff: and Geiger, 1914): see also Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public priesthoods and religious law ===
&lt;!--The article Titii links to this section; if changing the section subhead, please change the link in that article as well (if redistributing content as well, what the Titii article wants is just a structural description of Roman priesthoods); Sodales Augustales ditto--&gt;[[File:Ara pacis fregio lato ovest 2 A.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Flamines wearing their distinctive pointed headgear (grouped to the left), in a panel from the [[Ara Pacis]]]]
Rome had no separate priestly caste or class. The highest authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices, officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes. Specialists from the religious colleges and professionals such as [[Haruspex|''haruspices'']] and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the ''paterfamilias'' functioned as priest, and members of his ''familia'' as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the ''[[Flamen|flamines]]'' (the singular is ''flamen''), attributed to king Numa: the major ''flamines'', dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser ''flamines'' were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. ''Flamines'' were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter's ''flamen'' in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 39 – 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Regal era, a ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' (king of the sacred rites) supervised regal and state rites in conjunction with the king (''rex'') or in his absence, and announced the public festivals. He had little or no civil authority. With the abolition of monarchy, the collegial power and influence of the Republican ''pontifices'' increased. By the late Republican era, the flamines were supervised by the pontifical ''collegia''. The ''rex sacrorum'' had become a relatively obscure priesthood with an entirely symbolic title: his religious duties still included the daily, ritual announcement of festivals and priestly duties within two or three of the latter but his most important priestly role – the supervision of the [[Vestal Virgins|Vestals]] and their rites – fell to the more politically powerful and influential ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 18 – 34, 54 – 61: "[the underlying purpose being that] whoever bore the title ''rex'' should never again be in a position to threaten the city with tyranny." See also [[Religion in ancient Rome#Religion and politics|Religion and politics]] in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public priests were appointed by the ''collegia''. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 104 – 8: there can be no doubt that politicians attempted to manipulate religious law and priesthoods for gain; but were compelled to do so lawfully, and often failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, in Rüpke (ed), 331 – 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For those who had reached their goal in the ''[[Cursus honorum]]'', permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which fulfilled an essential public duty. For a freedman or slave, promotion as one of the Compitalia ''seviri'' offered a high local profile, and opportunities in local politics; and therefore business.&lt;ref&gt;See Gradel, 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman citizenship and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was the first step in a provincial ''cursus honorum''. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role was performed by the [[Arval Brethren]], once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus as part of his religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every 3 January they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Vestals ====
[[File:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|150px|A [[Roman sculpture]] depicting a [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]]]]
The [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]] were a public priesthood of six women devoted to the cultivation of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], goddess of the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|hearth of the Roman state and its vital flame]]. A girl chosen to be a Vestal achieved unique religious distinction, public status and privileges, and could exercise considerable political influence. Upon entering her office, a Vestal was emancipated from her [[paterfamilias|father's authority]]. In archaic Roman society, these priestesses were the only women not required to be under the legal guardianship of a man, instead answering directly to the Pontifex Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Vestal's dress represented her status outside the usual categories that defined Roman women, with elements of both virgin bride and daughter, and Roman matron and wife.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 52 – 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike male priests, Vestals were freed of the traditional obligations of marrying and producing children, and were required to take a vow of chastity that was strictly enforced: a Vestal polluted by the loss of her chastity while in office was buried alive.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 51 – 54, 70 – 71, 297. For comparison of Vestal constraints to those of Jupiter's flamen, see Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 39 – 40&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the exceptional honor accorded a Vestal was religious rather than personal or social; her privileges required her to be fully devoted to the performance of her duties, which were considered essential to the security of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vestals embody the profound connection between domestic cult and the religious life of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 50 – 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Any householder could rekindle their own household fire from Vesta's flame. The Vestals cared for the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]] of the state that were the equivalent of those enshrined in each home. Besides their own festival of [[Vestalia]], they participated directly in the rites of [[Parilia]], [[Parentalia]] and [[Fordicidia]]. Indirectly, they played a role in every official sacrifice; among their duties was the preparation of the ''[[mola salsa]]'', the salted flour that was sprinkled on every [[sacrificial victim]] as part of its immolation.&lt;ref&gt;Ariadne Staples, ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998), pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

One mythological tradition held that the mother of Romulus and Remus was a Vestal virgin of royal blood. A tale of miraculous birth also attended on [[Servius Tullius]], sixth king of Rome, son of a virgin slave-girl impregnated by a disembodied [[phallus]] arising mysteriously on the royal hearth; the story was connected to the ''[[fascinus]]'' that was among the cult objects under the guardianship of the Vestals.

Augustus' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor [[Claudius]] appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified [[Livia]], wife of Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 193-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor [[Gratian]] refused the office of ''pontifex maximus'', he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor [[Theodosius I]] extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple.

=== Augury ===
{{Main|Augur}}
Public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an [[augur]]. The original meaning of the Latin word ''templum'' was this sacred space, and only later referred to a building.&lt;ref name="Scheid, in Rüpke ed, 263 – 271" /&gt; Rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space; its ancient boundary ''([[pomerium]])'' had been marked by Romulus himself with oxen and plough; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state. In Rome, the central references for the establishment of an augural ''templum'' appear to have been the [[Via Sacra]] (Sacred Way) and the pomerium.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur, who read the divine will through observations made within the ''templum'' before, during and after an act of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice, errant rites (''[[vitium]]'') or an unacceptable plan of action. If an unfavourable sign was given, the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen, consult with his augural colleagues, or abandon the project. Magistrates could use their right of augury (''ius augurum'') to adjourn and overturn the process of law, but were obliged to base their decision on the augur's observations and advice. For Cicero, himself an augur, this made the augur the most powerful authority in the Late Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 17-20: citing Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.4.&lt;/ref&gt; By his time (mid 1st century BC) augury was supervised by the college of ''[[pontifices]]'', whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Brent, 21-25"&gt;Brent, 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Haruspicy ====
{{Main|haruspex}}
[[File:Piacenza Bronzeleber.jpg|thumb|The bronze [[Liver of Piacenza]] is an Etruscan artifact that probably served as an instructional model for the haruspex]]
[[Haruspex|Haruspicy]] was also used in public cult, under the supervision of the augur or presiding magistrate. The haruspices divined the will of the gods through examination of entrails after sacrifice, particularly the liver. They also interpreted omens, prodigies and portents, and formulated their expiation. Most Roman authors describe haruspicy as an ancient, ethnically Etruscan "outsider" religious profession, separate from Rome's internal and largely unpaid priestly hierarchy, essential but never quite respectable.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol 1, 12-20. See also [[John Scheid|Scheid]], in Rüpke (ed), 266.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-to-late Republic, the reformist [[Gaius Gracchus]], the populist politician-general [[Gaius Marius]] and his antagonist [[Sulla]], and the "notorious [[Verres]]" justified their very different policies by the divinely inspired utterances of private diviners. The senate and armies used the public haruspices: at some time during the late Republic, the Senate decreed that Roman boys of noble family be sent to Etruria for training in haruspicy and divination. Being of independent means, they would be better motivated to maintain a pure, religious practice for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;Horster, in Rüpke (ed) 336 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The motives of private haruspices – especially females – and their clients were officially suspect: none of this seems to have troubled Marius, who employed a Syrian prophetess.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero finds all forms of divination false, except those used in State rituals; most Romans were less skeptical. See Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 300, and Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Omens and prodigies ====
[[Omen]]s observed within or from a divine augural templum – especially the flight of birds – were sent by the gods in response to official queries. A magistrate with ''ius augurium'' (the right of augury) could declare the suspension of all official business for the day (''obnuntiato'') if he deemed the omens unfavourable.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar used his ''ius augurium'' to declare ''obnuntiato'' to Cicero's disadvantage: and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an apparently negative omen could be re-interpreted as positive, or deliberately blocked from sight.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 65 – 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prodigy (divination)|Prodigies]] were transgressions in the natural, predictable order of the cosmos – signs of divine anger that portended conflict and misfortune. The Senate decided whether a reported prodigy was false, or genuine and in the public interest, in which case it was referred to the public priests, augurs and haruspices for ritual expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 207 BC, during one of the Punic Wars' worst crises, the Senate dealt with an unprecedented number of confirmed prodigies whose expiation would have involved "at least twenty days" of dedicated rites.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy presents these as signs of widespread failure in Roman ''religio''. The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of  "greater victims". The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a [[rooster|cock]] (and vice versa) – these were expiated with "lesser victims". The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 295 – 8: the task fell to the haruspex, who set the child to drown in the sea. The survival of such a child for four years after its birth would have between regarded as extreme dereliction of religious duty.&lt;/ref&gt; and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Regina]], singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 27.37.5–15; the hymn was composed by the poet [[Livius Andronicus]]. Cited by Halm, in Rüpke (ed) 244. For remainder, see Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious restitution is proved only by Rome's victory.&lt;ref&gt;See Livy, 22.1 ff: The expiatory [[Religion in ancient Rome#Sacrifice|burial of living human victims]] in the Forum Boarium followed Rome's defeat at Cannae in the same wars. In Livy's account, Rome's victory follows its discharge of religious duties to the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Livy's use of prodigies and portents as markers of Roman impiety and military failure, see Feeney, in Rüpke (ed), 138 – 9. For prodigies in the context of political decision-making, see Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 295 – 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wider context of Graeco-Roman religious culture, Rome's earliest reported portents and prodigies stand out as atypically dire. Whereas for Romans, a comet presaged misfortune, for Greeks it might equally signal a divine or exceptionally fortunate birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Republic, a daytime comet at the murdered Julius Caesar's funeral games confirmed his deification; a discernible Greek influence on Roman interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funerals and the afterlife ==
{{Main|Roman funerals and burial}}
Roman beliefs about an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who expressed their views in terms of their chosen philosophy. The traditional care of the dead, however, and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion. Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 35 – 6: Rome's Latin neighbours significantly influenced the development of its domestic and funerary architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 35 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons of low or negligible status might receive simple burial, with such grave goods as relatives could afford.

[[File:Stele Licinia Amias Terme 67646.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[Early Christian inscriptions|earliest Christian inscriptions]] (3rd century), this funerary [[stele]] preserves the traditional abbreviation ''D. M.'', ''Dis Manibus'', "for the Manes gods", with the Christian motto in Greek ''Ikhthus zōntōn'' ("fish of the living") and the identity of the deceased in Latin]]
Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with "a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient". Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the ''di Manes'', who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the [[Parentalia]], a multi-day festival of remembrance in February.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 267, 270 – 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard Roman funerary inscription is ''Dis Manibus'' (to the Manes-gods). Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, ''theoîs katachthoníois''&lt;ref&gt;From a Romano-Athenian veteran's tomb; [[René Cagnat|Cagnat, René]], ''Inscriptiones Graecae ad res Romanas pertinentes.''
Paris 1906–27, 3.917.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lugdunum]]'s commonplace but mysterious "dedicated under the trowel" ''(sub ascia dedicare)''.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke, (ed) 186 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Imperial era, the burial and commemorative practises of Christian and non-Christians overlapped. Tombs were shared by Christian and non-Christian family members, and the traditional funeral rites and feast of ''novemdialis'' found a part-match in the Christian ''Constitutio Apostolica''.&lt;ref&gt;This recommended Christian commemorative rites on the 3rd, 9th &amp; 30th days after death.&lt;/ref&gt; The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the "drunken" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying [[Feralia]] and [[Caristia]] in sufficient numbers for the [[Council of Tours]] to forbid them in AD 567. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly [[relic]]s, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to "new life".&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, in Rüpke, (ed), 114 – 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and the military ==
[[File:ML - Genius Legion.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Genius (mythology)|genius]] of the legion (2nd–3rd century CE)]]
Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective ''virtus'' (roughly, "manly virtue") and the divine will: lack of ''virtus'', civic or private negligence in ''religio'' and the growth of ''superstitio'' provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster. Military success was the touchstone of a special relationship with the gods, and to Jupiter Capitolinus in particular; triumphal generals were dressed as Jupiter, and laid their victor's laurels at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 44, 59 – 60, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman commanders offered vows to be fulfilled after success in battle or siege; and further vows to expiate their failures. [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] promised Veii's goddess Juno a temple in Rome as incentive for her desertion ''([[evocatio]])'', conquered the city in her name, brought her cult statue to Rome "with miraculous ease" and dedicated a temple to her on the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, T., in Walbank et al., 299, citing Livy 21.8-9 and 22.3-6. Livy describes this as ''[[:wikt:evocatio|evocatio]]'' (a "calling forth") initiated by Roman soldiers who snatched the goddess's sacrificial portion during her Veiian rites; the Veiian priest had announced that whoever possessed the sacred entrails would win the coming battle. Preview via googlebooks [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qXuay2SEtIC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=evocatio+Livy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tw18ellncZ&amp;sig=CCmiclyD6vybeYE6Bn-HlHayjuE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VU_pS7C3EJGjsQbymMTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=evocatio%20Livy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman camps followed a standard pattern for defense and religious ritual; in effect they were Rome in miniature. The commander's headquarters stood at the centre; he took the auspices on a dais in front. A small building behind housed the legionary standards, the divine images used in religious rites and in the Imperial era, the image of the ruling emperor. In one camp, this shrine is even called Capitolium. The most important camp-offering appears to have been the ''suovetaurilia'' performed before a major, set battle. A ram, a boar and a bull were ritually garlanded, led around the outer perimeter of the camp (a ''lustratio exercitus'') and in through a gate, then sacrificed: Trajan's column shows three such events from his Dacian wars. The perimeter procession and sacrifice suggest the entire camp as a divine ''templum''; all within are purified and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Moede, in Rüpke (ed), 171, &amp; Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 326 – 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:010 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel X.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Panel from [[Trajan's Column]] depicting the [[lustrum|lustral]] procession of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'' victims under military standards]]
Each camp had its own religious personnel; standard bearers, priestly officers and their assistants, including a haruspex, and housekeepers of shrines and images. A senior magistrate-commander (sometimes even a consul) headed it, his chain of subordinates ran it and a ferocious system of training and discipline ensured that every citizen-soldier knew his duty. As in Rome, whatever gods he served in his own time seem to have been his own business; legionary forts and ''vici'' included shrines to household gods, personal deities and deities otherwise unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., Vol. 1, 324 – 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest Imperial era, citizen legionaries and provincial auxiliaries gave cult to the emperor and his ''familia'' on Imperial accessions, anniversaries and their renewal of annual vows. They celebrated Rome's official festivals ''in absentia'', and had the official triads appropriate to their function – in the Empire, Jupiter, [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] and [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] were typical. By the early Severan era, the military also offered cult to the Imperial ''divi'', the current emperor's ''numen'', ''genius'' and ''domus'' (or ''familia''), and special cult to the Empress as "mother of the camp". The near ubiquitous legionary shrines to [[Mithras]] of the later Imperial era were not part of official cult until Mithras was absorbed into [[Sol Invictus|Solar]] and Stoic [[Monism]] as a focus of military [[Concordia (mythology)|''concordia'']] and Imperial loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Brent, 268-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r2hBqYtZWNEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA249&amp;lpg=RA1-PA249&amp;dq=Hadrian+dominus+noster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iGyQvK9dmg&amp;sig=vaZeVEzQcQBaBNI50TAs25R5b1M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5B8Sp-3HpzLjAedq6SIBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Le Bohec, 249: limited preview available via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VqM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22mother+of+the+camp%22+severus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhNo0AFEQu&amp;sig=0MDpTCprN9nfkIIDa8eFLwUCbhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gah8Sp_IO9SG-QbovLVb&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mother%20of%20the%20camp%22%20severus&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Dixon, 78: limited preview available from Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jupiter dolichenus 3rd century Carnuntum.jpg|thumb|upright|A votive statue of [[Jupiter Dolichenus]] dedicated by a [[centurion]] for the wellbeing of the emperor ([[Carnuntum]], 3rd century)]]
The ''[[devotio]]'' was the most extreme offering a Roman general could make, promising to offer his own life in battle along with the enemy as an offering to the underworld gods. Livy offers a detailed account of the ''devotio'' carried out by [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 340 BC)|Decius Mus]]; family tradition maintained that [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 312 BC)|his son]] and [[Publius Decius Mus (consul 279 BC)|grandson]], all bearing the same name, also devoted themselves. Before the battle, Decius is granted a prescient dream that reveals his fate. When he offers sacrifice, the victim's liver appears "damaged where it refers to his own fortunes". Otherwise, the haruspex tells him, the sacrifice is entirely acceptable to the gods. In a [[Novensiles#The invocation of Decius Mus|prayer recorded by Livy]], Decius commits himself and the enemy to the ''dii [[Manes]]'' and [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]], charges alone and headlong into the enemy ranks, and is killed; his action cleanses the sacrificial offering. Had he failed to die, his sacrificial offering would have been tainted and therefore void, with possibly disastrous consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 5.21.3., &amp; 8.9.8; Beard ''et al''., Vol 1, 35 – 36; Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 312; Halm, in Rüpke (ed), 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of ''devotio'' is a link between military ethics and those of the Roman [[Gladiator#Gladiators and the military|gladiator]].

The efforts of military commanders to channel the divine will were on occasion less successful. In the early days of Rome's war against Carthage, the commander [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)]] launched a sea campaign "though the sacred chickens would not eat when he took the auspices". In defiance of the omen, he threw them into the sea, "saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. He was defeated, and on being bidden by the senate to appoint a dictator, he appointed his messenger Glycias, as if again making a jest of his country's peril." His impiety not only lost the battle but ruined his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberger, in Rüpke (ed), 3OO, citing Suetonius, Tiberius, 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women and religion ==
:''See also [[Women in ancient Rome#Religious life|Women in ancient Rome: Religious life]]''

Roman women were present at most festivals and cult observances. Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their active participation was limited. As a rule women did not perform animal sacrifice, the central rite of most major public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.,'' Vol. 1, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the public priesthood of the Vestals, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the [[Bona Dea]] excluded men entirely.&lt;ref&gt;''Beard ''et al.,'' Vol. 1, 296 – 7. This exclusion prompted prurient speculation on the part of men, and a scandalous, impious intrusion by [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the ''paterfamilias''. A host of deities, however, are associated with motherhood. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], and [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|specialized divine attendants]] presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent.

Literary sources vary in their depiction of women's religiosity: some represent women as paragons of Roman virtue and devotion, but also inclined by temperament to self-indulgent religious enthusiasms, novelties and the seductions of ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 297. ''Ibid'' 217, citing the obituary of a woman whose virtues included "''religio'' without ''superstitio''" ([[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]] 8393.30-31 of "Turia").&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Superstitio''&lt;!--THIS IS THE LATIN FORM, hence the italics; DO NOT CHANGE TO ENGLISH 'superstition'--&gt; and magic ==

Excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were ''[[superstitio]]'', in the sense of "doing or believing more than was necessary",&lt;ref name="Rüpke, in Rüpke ed, 5"&gt;Rüpke, in Rüpke (ed), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone.&lt;ref&gt;See Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries between ''religio'' and ''superstitio'' are perhaps indefinite. The famous tirade of [[Lucretius]], the Epicurean rationalist, against what is usually translated as "superstition" was in fact aimed at excessive ''religio''. Roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith,&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''superstitio'' was viewed as an "inappropriate desire for knowledge"; in effect, an abuse of ''religio''.&lt;ref name="Rüpke, in Rüpke ed, 5" /&gt;

In the everyday world, many individuals sought to divine the future, influence it through magic, or seek vengeance with help from "private" diviners. The state-sanctioned taking of auspices was a form of public divination with the intent of ascertaining the will of the gods, not foretelling the future. Secretive consultations between private diviners and their clients were thus suspect. So were divinatory techniques such as astrology when used for illicit, subversive or magical purposes. Astrologers and magicians were officially expelled from Rome at various times, notably in 139 BC and 33 BC. In 16 BC Tiberius expelled them under extreme penalty because an astrologer had predicted his death. "Egyptian rites" were particularly suspect: Augustus banned them within the ''pomerium'' to doubtful effect; Tiberius repeated and extended the ban with extreme force in AD 19.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al., 230 – 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several Imperial bans, magic and astrology persisted among all social classes. In the late 1st century AD, Tacitus observed that astrologers "would always be banned and always retained at Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, in Rüpke (ed), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, in Flint ''et al''., 83: citing Pliny, ''Natural History'', 28.17 – 18; Seneca, ''Natural Questions,'' 4.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 231 – 233, citing Tacitus, ''Histories'', 1.22. Tacitus' prediction was accurate: in the late 3rd century, Diocletian issued a general ban on astrology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Graeco-Roman world, practitioners of magic were known as ''[[magi]]'' (singular ''magus''), a "foreign" title of Persian priests. [[Apuleius]], defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as "in popular tradition ''(more vulgari)''... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (''vi cantaminum'') for everything he wishes to."&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apologia'', 26.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] offers a thoroughly skeptical "History of magical arts" from their supposed Persian origins to Nero's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices in an attempt to control the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 30.1 – 18; see also Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] takes pains to point out that the celebrated [[Apollonius of Tyana]] was definitely not a ''magus'', "despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to vanish into thin air".&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 217 – 219 &amp; 224, citing Philostratus, ''Life of Apollonius'', I.2, IV.18, V.12, VII.11,20,33-4,39, VIII.5,7,19,30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucan]] depicts [[Sextus Pompeius]], the doomed son of [[Pompey the Great]], as convinced "the gods of heaven knew too little" and awaiting the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] by consulting with the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] witch [[Erichtho]], who practices [[necromancy]] and inhabits deserted graves, feeding on rotting corpses. Erichtho, it is said, can arrest "the rotation of the heavens and the flow of rivers" and make "austere old men blaze with illicit passions". She and her clients are portrayed as undermining the natural order of gods, mankind and destiny. A female foreigner from Thessaly, notorious for witchcraft, Erichtho is the stereotypical witch of Latin literature,&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 219 – 20, citing Lucan, Pharsalia,VI.413 – 830.&lt;/ref&gt; along with Horace's Canidia.

[[File:Magical book Kircherian Terme.jpg|thumb|left|Bound tablets with magic inscriptions from late antiquity]]
The Twelve Tables forbade any harmful incantation (''[[malum carmen]]'', or 'noisome metrical charm'); this included the "charming of crops from one field to another" (''excantatio frugum'') and any rite that sought harm or death to others. [[Chthonic]] deities functioned at the margins of Rome's divine and human communities; although sometimes the recipients of public rites, these were conducted outside the sacred boundary of the ''pomerium''. Individuals seeking their aid did so away from the public gaze, during the hours of darkness. Burial grounds and isolated crossroads were among the likely portals.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263.&lt;/ref&gt; The barrier between private religious practices and "magic" is permeable, and Ovid gives a vivid account of rites at the fringes of the public [[Feralia]] festival that are indistinguishable from magic: an old woman [[Squatting position|squats]] among a circle of younger women, sews up a fish-head, smears it with pitch, then pierces and roasts it to "bind hostile tongues to silence". By this she invokes Tacita, the "Silent One" of the underworld.

Archaeology confirms the widespread use of binding spells (''[[defixiones]]''), [[Greek Magical Papyri|magical papyri]] and so-called "voodoo dolls" from a very early era. Around 250 ''defixiones'' have been recovered just from [[Roman Britain]], in both urban and rural settings. Some seek straightforward, usually gruesome revenge, often for a lover's offense or rejection. Others appeal for divine redress of wrongs, in terms familiar to any Roman magistrate, and promise a portion of the value (usually small) of lost or stolen property in return for its restoration. None of these ''defixiones'' seem produced by, or on behalf of the elite, who had more immediate recourse to human law and justice. Similar traditions existed throughout the empire, persisting until around the 7th century AD, well into the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 186: about 200 of these British defixiones are from Sulla-Minerva's spring in urban Bath and the remainder from a shrine to a Celtic deity ([[Nodens]]), at rural Uley. For ''defixiones'' as direct appeals to divine justice, see Belayche, in Rüpke (ed), 286. For the widespread persistence of curse-tablet rituals, see Ogden, in Flint ''et al''., 3 – 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Roman religion ==

=== Religion and politics ===
[[File:Baalbek-Bacchus.jpg|thumb|right|text|[[Temple of Bacchus]] ("Temple of the Sun"), c. 150 AD]]
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
Rome's government, politics and religion were dominated by an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy. Approximately half Rome's population were slave or free non-citizens. Most others were [[plebeians]], the lowest class of Roman citizens. Less than a quarter of adult males had voting rights; far fewer could actually exercise them. Women had no vote.&lt;ref&gt;During the Augustan era, the city of Rome probably housed around a million people, including an unknown number of provincials: by Mouritsen's estimate, around 200,000 Roman citizens were eligible to vote in Rome itself during the late Republican era but during major elections, the influx of rural voters and the bottleneck of the city's ancient electoral apparatus meant that perhaps 12% of eligible citizens actually voted. This nevertheless represents a substantial increase from the estimated 1% adult male enfranchisement rights of 145 BC. At any time, the overwhelming majority of citizens – meaning the plebs – had minimal direct involvement in central government. See Henrik Mouritsen, Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic (Cambridge, U.K., Cambridge University Press, 2001), 32ff.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all official business was conducted under the divine gaze and auspices, in the name of the senate and people of Rome. "In a very real sense the senate was the caretaker of the Romans’ relationship with the divine, just as it was the caretaker of their relationship with other humans".&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome's internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 59 – 60.&lt;/ref&gt; They resorted to [[Conflict of the Orders|strikes and violence]] to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, in Rüpke (ed), 283: citing Plutarch, Camillus, 42. Belayche describes this as a votive offering (''uotum''), which "offered a supernatural legitimacy for decisions or actions... [and] entailed being assisted and reassured, through the forwarding of hopes or dis-
appointments, anger or contentment, to superior powers." See also Versnel, Henrik S., (ed), "Religious mentality in ancient prayer," in Versnel, Henrik S., Faith, Hope and Worship: Aspects of Religious Mentality in the Ancient World, Leyden, 1981, pp 1 – 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious calendars and [[Twelve Tables|laws]] were eventually made public. [[Tribune of the plebs|Plebeian tribunes]] were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians.&lt;ref&gt;The ''collegia'' were opened to plebs by the ''[[Lex Ogulnia]]'' of 300 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;"The change that comes about at the end of the republic and solidifies under Augustus is not political, but cultural". Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 72: citing Habinek, T., and Schiesaro, A., (eds.) ''The Roman Cultural Revolution.'' Princeton, New Jersey, 1997 &amp; Wallace-Hadrill, A., "Mutatas formas: the Augustan transformation of Roman knowledge", in: Galinsky, K., (ed.) ''The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Augustus'', Cambridge, 2005, pp 55 – 84: ''contra'' Syme, R., The Roman Revolution, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, in Rüpke (ed), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Punic crisis, popular cult to [[Dionysus]] emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with [[Liber|Father Liber]], the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman [[Bacchus]]. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial [[Bacchanalia]] cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of [[Marsyas#Prophecy and free speech at Rome|Marsyas]], the ''[[Silenus|silen]]'' of Dionysus flayed by [[Apollo]], became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; [[Liberalia|Liber's festival]] continued.&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 72: "...the change that comes about at the end of the republic and solidifies under Augustus is not political, but cultural. Most of the members of the priestly colleges in Augustus’ time continued to be aristocrats, but the real power and control over religion and the calendar now flowed from professional experts, such as the polymath Varro, because they had the power of knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two centuries later, when Decius and Diocletian required universal sacrifice to Roman gods as a test of loyalty, any traditional gods served the purpose: loyal compliance with Imperial dictat made them Roman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustan settlement built upon a cultural shift in Roman society. In the middle Republican era, even [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]]'s tentative hints that he might be Jupiter's special protege sat ill with his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Scipio did not claim personal connections with Jupiter; but he did not deny rumours to that effect. Contrary to usual practice, his ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imago]]'' (funeral mask) was stored in the Temple of Jupiter.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians of the later Republic were less equivocal; both [[Sulla]] and [[Pompey]] claimed special relationships with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Julius Caesar went further; he claimed her as [[Venus (mythology)#Epithets|his ancestress]], and thus an intimate source of divine inspiration for his personal character and policies. In 63 BC, his appointment as ''pontifex maximus'' "signaled his emergence as a major player in Roman politics".&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, political candidates could sponsor temples, priesthoods and the immensely popular, spectacular public ''ludi'' and ''munera'' whose provision became increasingly indispensable to the factional politics of the Late Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise, electoral bribery ([[ambitus]]): see Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 2.3: see also Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 65 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[principate]], such opportunities were limited by law; priestly and political power were consolidated in the person of the princeps ("first citizen").
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because of you we are living, because of you we can travel the seas, because of you we enjoy liberty and wealth." ''A thanksgiving prayer offered in Naples' harbour to the princeps Augustus, on his return from Alexandria in 14 AD, shortly before his death.''&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 310.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Early Republic ===
&lt;!-- This section should illuminate Rome's internal struggles; for example, the dictator Camillus' promise to found a temple to Concordia, against the background of conflict between Patricians and Plebs.  --&gt;
[[File:Affreschi romani - Ercolano - Teseo liberatore1.JPG|thumb|A fresco depicting [[Theseus]], from [[Herculaneum]] ([[Ercolano]]), Italy, 45-79 AD]]
By the end of the [[Roman Kingdom|regal period]] Rome had developed into a city-state, with a large plebeian, artisan class excluded from the old patrician ''[[Gens|gentes]]'' and from the state priesthoods. The city had commercial and political treaties with its neighbours; according to tradition, Rome's [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] connections established a temple to [[Minerva]] on the predominantly plebeian [[Aventine hill|Aventine]]; she became part of a new Capitoline triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, installed in a Capitoline temple, built in an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan style]] and dedicated in a new September festival, ''[[Epulum Jovis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"From Etruria the Romans derived the idea of housing a deity in a temple and of providing him with a cult statue. ... The most famous... dedicated in the first year of the Republic to the Etruscan triad, Tinia, Uni and Minerva. Of these deities, however, two were Italian, Juno and Minerva, while Tinia was identified with Jupiter." Howard Hayes Scullard, (2003), A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC, page 397. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; These are supposedly the first Roman deities whose images were adorned, as if noble guests, at their own inaugural banquet.

Rome's diplomatic agreement with its neighbours of [[Latium]] confirmed the [[Latin league]] and brought the cult of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] from [[Aricia, Italy|Aricia]] to the Aventine.&lt;ref&gt;"Her cult at Aricia was first attested in Latin literature by [[Cato the Elder]], in a surviving quote by the late grammarian [[Priscian]]. Supposed Greek origins for the Aricia cult are strictly a literary [[topos]]." Arthur E. Gordon, "On the Origin of Diana", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 63 (1932, pp. 177-192) page 178 note, and page 181.&lt;/ref&gt; and established on the Aventine in the "commune Latinorum Dianae templum":&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Ling. Lat.'' v. 43&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)#Iuppiter Latiaris and Feriae Latinae|Jupiter Latiaris]] was built on the [[Alban Hills|Alban mount]], its stylistic resemblance to the new Capitoline temple pointing to Rome's inclusive hegemony. Rome's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the ''[[Pomerium|pomoerium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Pomoerium.html ''Pomoerium''], ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', page 930-1. London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cult to [[Hercules]] at the ''[[Great Altar of Hercules|ara maxima]]'' in the [[Forum Boarium]] was established through commercial connections with [[Tibur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Ara_Maxima_Herculis.html ''Ara Maxima Herculis''], ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', page 253-4. Oxford University Press, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tusculum|Tusculan]] cult of [[Castor (mythology)|Castor]] as the patron of cavalry found a home close to the [[Forum Romanum]]:&lt;ref&gt;"Traditionally in 499, the cult of Castor and Pollux was introduced from Tusculum and temple was erected in the Forum." Howard Hayes Scullard, (2003), A History of the Roman World, 753 to 146 BC, page 398. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juno Sospita]] and [[Juno Regina]] were brought from Italy, and [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Fortuna Primigenia]] from [[Praeneste]]. In 217, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was brought from Sicily and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 23.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later Republic to Principate ===
The disasters of the early part of Rome's [[second Punic War]] were attributed, in Livy's account, to a growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury and the neglect of Rome's traditional gods, whose anger was expressed directly in Rome's defeat at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] (216 BC). The Sibilline books were consulted. They recommended a general vowing of the ''[[ver sacrum]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Ver_Sacrum.html ''Ver Sacrum''], ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', page 1189, London, 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year, the burial of two Greeks and two Gauls; not the first or the last of its kind, according to Livy.

The introduction of new or equivalent deities coincided with Rome's most significant aggressive and defensive military forays. In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic [[Magna Mater]] (Great Mother) from [[Pessinus]], installed on the [[Palatine hill|Palatine]] in 191 BC. The mystery cult to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in 186 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/romrelig2.html#Livy2 ''Dionysius and the Bacchanalia, 186 B.C.''] from Livy: ''History of Rome''.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium: temples were dedicated to [[Juventas]] ([[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]) in 191 BC,&lt;ref&gt;''Hebe'' entry in ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''. 1867&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ([[Artemis]]) in 179 BC, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] ([[Ares]]) in 138 BC), and to [[Bona Dea]], equivalent to [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]], the female counterpart of the rural [[Faunus]], supplemented by the Greek goddess [[Damia (goddess)|Damia]]. Further Greek influences on cult images and types represented the Roman [[Penates]] as forms of the Greek [[Dioscuri]]. The military-political adventurers of the Later Republic introduced the Phrygian goddess Ma (identified with Roman [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the Egyptian mystery-goddess [[Isis]] and Persian [[Mithras]].)

[[File:Pallas-athena-roman-mosaic.jpg|thumb|A 3rd-century Roman [[Pallas Athena]] [[mosaic]] from [[Tusculum]], now in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]
The spread of Greek literature, mythology and philosophy offered Roman poets and antiquarians a model for the interpretation of Rome's festivals and rituals, and the embellishment of its mythology. [[Ennius]] translated the work of Graeco-Sicilian [[Euhemerus]], who explained the genesis of the gods as [[apotheosis|apotheosized]] mortals. In the last century of the Republic, [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] and particularly [[Stoicism|Stoic]] interpretations were a preoccupation of the literate elite, most of whom held – or had held – high office and traditional Roman priesthoods; notably, [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Scaevola]] and the polymath [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]. For Varro – well versed in Euhemerus' theory – popular religious observance was based on a necessary fiction; what the people believed was not itself the truth, but their observance led them to as much higher truth as their limited capacity could deal with. Whereas in popular belief deities held power over mortal lives, the skeptic might say that mortal devotion had made gods of mortals, and these same gods were only sustained by devotion and cult.

Just as Rome itself claimed the favour of the gods, so did some individual Romans. In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity. Most notably in the very late Republic, the [[Julii]] claimed [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Genetrix]] as ancestor; this would be one of many foundations for the Imperial cult. The claim was further elaborated and justified in Vergil's poetic, Imperial vision of the past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[File:Affreschi romani - polifemo presenza galatea - pompei.JPG|thumb|''[[Polyphemus]] hears of the [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|arrival of Galatea]]''; ancient [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] painted in the [[Pompeian Styles|"Fourth Style" of Pompeii]] (45-79 AD)]]
In the late Republic, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] reforms lowered an existing property bar on conscription and increased the efficiency of Rome's armies but made them available as instruments of political ambition and factional conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke, (ed), 65&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent civil wars led to changes at every level of Roman society. Augustus' [[principate]] established peace and subtly transformed Rome's religious life – or, in the new ideology of Empire, restored it (see [[Religion in ancient Rome#Imperial cult|below]]).

Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' became a ''de facto'' consular prerogative.&lt;ref name="Brent, 21-25" /&gt; Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of ''pontifex maximus''; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient [[Arval Brethren|Arvales]], his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the [[Vestal Virgins|Vestals]] as a visible restoration of Roman morality.&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, in Rüpke (ed), 76. See also [[Res Gestae]].&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus obtained the ''pax deorum'', maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.

=== Roman Empire ===

==== Absorption of cults ====
[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Mithras]] in a Roman wall painting]]
The Roman Empire expanded to include different peoples and cultures; in principle, Rome followed the same inclusionist policies that had recognised Latin, Etruscan and other Italian peoples, cults and deities as Roman. Those who acknowledged Rome's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of Roman religious law.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Epistles, 10.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Newly municipal [[Sabratha]] built a Capitolium near its existing temple to [[Liber Pater]] and [[Serapis]]. Autonomy and concord were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models.&lt;ref&gt;As at Narbonne and Salona. See Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at [[Cuicul]] are of emperors or [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]. By the middle of the 1st century AD, Gaulish [[Vertault]] seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, Romanised cult nearby: by the end of that century, Sabratha's so-called [[tophet]] was no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice, not a centralised legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Major cult centres to "non-Roman" deities continued to prosper: notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian [[Serapium]], the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo's sacred wood at Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Van Andringa, in Rüpke (ed), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall scarcity of evidence for smaller or local cults does not always imply their neglect; votive inscriptions are inconsistently scattered throughout Rome's geography and history. Inscribed dedications were an expensive public declaration, one to be expected within the Graeco-Roman cultural ambit but by no means universal. Innumerable smaller, personal or more secretive cults would have persisted and left no trace.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 180 – 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military settlement within the empire and at its borders broadened the context of ''Romanitas''. Rome's citizen-soldiers set up altars to multiple deities, including their traditional gods, the Imperial genius and local deities – sometimes with the usefully open-ended dedication to the ''diis deabusque omnibus'' (all the gods and goddesses). They also brought Roman "domestic" deities and cult practices with them.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann-Heinimann, in Rüpke (ed), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the later granting of citizenship to provincials and their conscription into the legions brought their new cults into the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Haensch, in Rüpke (ed), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traders, legions and other travellers brought home cults originating from Egypt, Greece, Iberia, India and Persia. The cults of [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Mithras]], and [[Sol Invictus]] were particularly important. Some of those were initiatory religions of intense personal significance, similar to Christianity in those respects.

==== Imperial cult ====
[[File:MaisonCarrée.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Maison Carrée]] in [[Nîmes]], one of the best-preserved [[Roman temple]]s.  It is a mid-sized [[Augustus|Augustan]] provincial temple of the Imperial cult.]]
{{Main|Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|l1=Imperial cult of ancient Rome}}
In the early Imperial era, the [[princeps]] (lit. "first" or "foremost" among citizens) was offered ''genius''-cult as the symbolic ''paterfamilias'' of Rome. His cult had further precedents: popular, unofficial cult offered to powerful benefactors in Rome: the kingly, god-like honours granted a Roman general on the day of his [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; and in the divine honours paid to Roman magnates in the Greek East from at least 195 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 32-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 272-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deification of deceased emperors had precedent in Roman domestic cult to the ''dii parentes'' (deified ancestors) and the mythic [[apotheosis]] of Rome's founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State ''divus'' (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor's deceased wife, sister or daughter could be promoted to ''diva'' (female divinity).

The first and last Roman known as a living ''divus'' was [[Julius Caesar]], who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy; he was murdered soon after. Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar's successor, Augustus, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 3, part 1, 3: citing Cassius Dio, 51, 20, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his "reformed" and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his ''numen''. By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, book 1, 77 &amp; 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 1, book 1, 97-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an empire of great religious and cultural diversity, the Imperial cult offered a common Roman identity and dynastic stability. In Rome, the framework of government was recognisably Republican. In the Provinces, this would not have mattered; in Greece, the emperor was "not only endowed with special, super-human abilities, but... he was indeed a visible god" and the little Greek town of [[Akraiphia]] could offer official cult to "liberating Zeus Nero for all eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Hertz, in Rüpke (ed), 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As [[princeps]] (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living ''divus'' but father of his country (''pater patriae''), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the ''dii manes'' was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a ''divus'', he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of ''divus'' as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, 263-8, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his ''genius''; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, 46-56, 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jews and Roman religion ====
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects in 2nd-century [[gold glass]] from Rome]]
{{See also|Fiscus Judaicus|Religio licita|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
For at least a century before the establishment of the Augustan principate, Jews and Judaism were tolerated in Rome by diplomatic treaty with Judaea's Hellenised elite. [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] had much in common with the overwhelmingly Hellenic or Hellenised communities that surrounded them. Early Italian synagogues have left few traces; but one was dedicated in Ostia around the mid-1st century BC and several more are attested during the Imperial period. Judaea's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 BC increased the Jewish diaspora; in Rome, this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion. Their synagogues were recognised as legitimate ''collegia'' by Julius Caesar. By the Augustan era, the city of Rome was home to several thousand Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 266 – 7, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 2-3, 4-6: the presence of practicing Jews in Rome is attested "at least a century" before 63 BC. Smallwood describes the preamble to Judaea's clientage as the Hellenising of ruling Jewish dynasties, their claims to kingly messianism and their popular, traditionalist rejection in the Maccabaean revolt. In Rome, the more "characteristically Jewish" beliefs and customs were subjects of scorn and mockery.[https://books.google.com/books?id=jSYbpitEjggC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Jews+smallwood+actium+Parthia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWsQGlsrv8&amp;sig=1P-nIzMEdJTf6R0WrQTaT9aMrKo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VfooSsKeIZSDjAfBwpn3Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Books.Google.co.uk] ''Ibid'', 120-143 for early Roman responses to Judaistic practice; but see also Tessa Rajack, "Was there a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies,'' 74, (1984) 107-23; no "Roman charter" for Judaism should be inferred from local, ''ad hoc'' attempts to suppress anti-Jewish acts (as in Josephus' account); Judaism as ''religio licita'' is only found later, in Tertullian. Cicero, ''pro Flacco, 66'', refers to Judaism as ''superstitio''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods under Roman rule, Jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice, under certain conditions. Judaism was a ''superstitio'' to Cicero, but the [[Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] described it as ''[[religio licita]]'' (an officially permitted religion) in contrast to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, 2-3, 4-6:  ''superstitio'' in Cicero, ''pro Flacco'', 66, but legislation by Julius Caesar recognised the synagogues in Rome as legitimate ''collegia'' and Augustus maintained their status. Josephus infers an early "charter" offering protection to Jews, but Tessa Rajack, "Was there a Roman Charter for the Jews?" Journal of Roman Studies, 74, (1984) 107-23, finds evidence only for Rome's official suppression of anti-Jewish activities. ''Religio licita'' is first found much later than this, in Tertullian.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity in the Roman Empire==== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{See also|Pentarchy|History of Christianity|Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|State church of the Roman Empire}}
Roman investigations into early Christianity found it an irreligious, novel, disobedient, even atheistic sub-sect of Judaism: it appeared to deny all forms of religion and was therefore ''superstitio''. By the end of the Imperial era, Nicene Christianity was the one permitted Roman ''religio''; all other cults were heretical or pagan ''superstitiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', vol. 1, 225: citing Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'', 10.96.8, &amp; Beard et al., Vol. 2, 11.11a: citing Tacitus, ''Annals'', 15.44.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD, Emperor [[Nero]] accused the Christians as convenient scapegoats, who were later [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of early Christians by Romans|persecuted]] and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. &lt;!-- Fix preceding. Interpreted and cited from here, apart from final section --&gt;During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, "contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms", regardless of their allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base of support from the powerless, who seemed to have no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Rome's elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.

In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, the emperor [[Decius]] decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to "ancestral gods" or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 241-3: see 242 for Decian "libellus" (certificate) of oath and sacrifice on papyrus, dated to 250 AD.&lt;/ref&gt; Decius' edict appealed to whatever common ''mos maiores'' might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', Vol. 1, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults: see Leppin, in Rüpke, (ed), 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apostasy]] was sought, rather than capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EgCRHxfouQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Diocletian+Imperial+cult&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7_IdIU_pqN&amp;sig=UDSeRqdJLL5vX2gbIktCTtx58Bc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SLN8SqW5EonE-QaVm-1J&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Diocletian%20Imperial%20cult&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Rees, 60.

Books.Google.co.uk], Limited preview available at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] singled out Christianity as a particularly self-interested and subversive foreign cult, outlawed its assemblies and urged Christians to sacrifice to Rome's traditional gods.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60"&gt;Rees, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In another edict, he described Christianity as a threat to Empire – not yet at its heart but close to it, among Rome's equites and Senators. Christian apologists interpreted his eventual fate – a disgraceful capture and death – as divine judgement. The next forty years were peaceful; the Christian church grew stronger and its literature and theology gained a higher social and intellectual profile, due in part to its own search for political toleration and theological coherence. [[Origen]] discussed theological issues with traditionalist elites in a common Neoplatonist frame of reference – he had written to Decius' predecessor [[Philip the Arab]] in similar vein – and Hippolytus recognised a "pagan" basis in Christian heresies.&lt;ref&gt;See Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 98 – 99; citing Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 6.19.15; 21.3–4; 36.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian churches were disunited; Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch was deposed by a synod of 268 both for his doctrines, and for his unworthy, indulgent, elite lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 99; citing Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 7.29–30: Paul actually remained in office until "Aurelian's victory over Palmyra in 272, when he was forced to leave the 'building of the church'...&amp;nbsp;Political conflicts, local rivalry, and theological debates converged in this quarrel."&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Aurelian]] (270-75) appealed for harmony among his soldiers (''concordia militum''), stabilised the Empire and its borders and successfully established an official, Hellenic form of unitary cult to the [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] ''[[Sol Invictus]]'' in Rome's [[Campus Martius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, in Bowman et al. (eds), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 295, [[Maximilian of Tebessa]] refused military service; in 298 [[Marcellus of Tangier|Marcellus]] renounced his military oath. Both were executed for treason; both were Christians.&lt;ref name="Rees, 60" /&gt; At some time around 302, a report of ominous [[haruspicy]] in [[Diocletian]]'s ''domus'' and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered [[Diocletianic Persecution|a series of edicts]] against Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, II.6.10.1-4. A date of 302 is regarded as likely. [[Eusebius]] also says the persecutions of Christians began in the army; see Eusebius, II.8.1.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first (303 AD) "ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts, forbade services to be held, degraded officials who were Christians, re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians, and reduced the legal rights of all Christians... [Physical] or capital punishments were not imposed on them" but soon after, several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 103: citing Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'', 14.2; Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 8.6.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second edict threatened Christian priests with imprisonment and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 8.2.5, 8.6.10.&lt;/ref&gt; An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to traditional gods, in terms that recall the Decian edict.

In some cases and in some places the edicts were strictly enforced: some Christians resisted and were imprisoned or martyred. Others complied. Some local communities were not only pre-dominantly Christian, but powerful and influential; and some provincial authorities were lenient, notably the Caesar in Gaul, [[Constantius Chlorus]], the father of [[Constantine I]]. Diocletian's successor Galerius maintained anti-Christian policy until his deathbed revocation in 311, when he asked Christians to pray for him. "This meant an official recognition of their importance in the religious world of the Roman empire, although one of the tetrarchs, Maximinus Daia, still oppressed Christians in his part of the empire up to 313."&lt;ref&gt;Leppin, in Rüpke (ed), 103: citing Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'', 34 &amp; 13 &amp; ; Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 8.17.3–10 &amp; 8.2.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Emperor Constantine and Christianity =====
[[File:Trier - Aula Palatina.JPG|thumb|The [[Aula Palatina]] of [[Trier]], [[Germany]] (then part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]]), built during the reign of [[Constantine I]] (r. 306-337 AD)]]
The conversion of [[Constantine I]] ended the Christian persecutions. Constantine successfully balanced his own role as an instrument of the ''[[pax deorum]]'' with the power of the Christian priesthoods in determining what was (in traditional Roman terms) auspicious – or in Christian terms, what was orthodox. The edict of Milan (313) redefined Imperial ideology as one of mutual toleration. Constantine had triumphed under the ''signum'' (sign) of the Christ: Christianity was therefore officially embraced along with traditional religions and from his new [[Constantinople|Eastern capital]], Constantine could be seen to embody both Christian and Hellenic religious interests. He passed laws to protect Christians from persecution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also funded the building of churches, including [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's basilica]].  He may have officially ended – or attempted to end – blood sacrifices to the ''genius'' of living emperors, though his Imperial iconography and court ceremonial outstripped Diocletian's in their supra-human elevation of the Imperial hierarch.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine's permission for a new cult temple to himself and his family in Umbria is extant: the terms are vague – cult "should not be polluted by the deception of any contagious superstition". See Momigliano, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine promoted orthodoxy in Christian doctrine, so that Christianity might become a unitary force, rather than divisive. He summoned Christian bishops to a meeting, later known as the [[First Council of Nicaea]], at which some 318 bishops (mostly easterners) debated and decided what was orthodox, and what was [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. The meeting reached consensus on the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Chrisme Colosseum Rome Italy.jpg|thumb|Monogramme of Christ (the [[Chi Rho]]) on a plaque of a [[sarcophagus]], 4th-century CE, marble, Musei Vaticani, on display in a temporary exhibition at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy]]
&lt;!--This summary was moved from above: Imperial cult became a focus of theological and political debate during the ascendancy of Christianity under [[Constantine I]]. The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] failed to reverse the declining support for Rome's traditional cults: [[Theodosius I]] adopted Christianity as the Imperial State religion. Officially, the "Imperial cult" was abandoned, along with all cults other than Imperially sanctioned forms of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, 142-158.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
Christianity and traditional Roman religion proved incompatible. From the 2nd century onward, the [[Church Fathers]] had condemned the diverse non-Christian religions practiced throughout the Empire as "pagan".&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Brown, in Bowersock ''et al.'', ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', Harvard University Press, (1999), for "pagan" as a mark of socio-religious inferiority in Latin Christian polemic: [https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&amp;pg=PA625&amp;dq=pagus+paganus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's actions have been regarded by some scholars as causing the rapid growth of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay MacMullen, Christianizing the Roman empire. A.D.100-400. Yale University Press. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; though revisionist scholars disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stephenson, Constantine: Unconquered emperor, Christian victor (2009) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, ''The Triumph of Christianity: How the Jesus Movement Became the World's Largest Religion'' (Harper Collins 2011) pp. 169-182&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's unique form of Imperial orthodoxy did not outlast him. After his death in 337, two of his sons, [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]], took over the leadership of the empire and re-divided their Imperial inheritance. Constantius was an [[Arianism|Arian]] and his brothers were Nicene Christians.

Constantine's nephew [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] rejected the "Galilean madness" of his upbringing for an idiosyncratic synthesis of [[neo-Platonism]], Stoic asceticism and universal solar cult. Julian became Augustus in 361 and actively but vainly fostered a religious and cultural pluralism, attempting a restitution of non-Christian practices and rights.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation is available online at the Wisconsin Lutheran College website – [http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/imperial-laws-chart FourthCentury.com] (accessed 30 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem's temple as an Imperial project and argued against the "irrational impieties" of Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See Julian's ''Against the Galilaeans'' (trans. Wright, from Cyril of Alexandria's later refutation, ''Contra Julianum'') at [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_galileans_1_text.htm Tertullian.org] (accessed 30 August 2009). Julian admired the work of the Platonist (or neo-Platonist) [[Iamblichus]].&lt;/ref&gt; His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The empire once again fell under Christian control, this time permanently.

In 380, under [[Theodosius I]], [[Nicene Christianity]] became the official [[state church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]]. [[Christian heresy|Christian heretics]] as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, though Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms,&lt;ref name="Stefan Heid 2007 pp. 406"&gt;Stefan Heid, "The Romanness of Roman Christianity", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 406–426; on vocabulary in particular, Robert Schilling, "The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion", ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.

The Western emperor [[Gratian]] refused the office of ''pontifex maximus'', and against the protests of the senate, removed the [[altar of Victory]] from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the Vestals. [[Theodosius I]] briefly re-united the Empire: in 391 he officially adopted Nicene Christianity as the Imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults. He not only refused to restore Victory to the senate-house, but extinguished the Sacred fire of the Vestals and vacated their temple: the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] to the Western and Eastern emperors. [[Ambrose]], the influential [[Bishop of Milan]] and future saint, wrote urging the rejection of Symmachus's request for tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence is available online at Internet Medieval Sourcebook: Letter of St. Ambrose, trans. H. De Romestin, 1896., [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ambrose-sym.html Fordham.edu] (accessed 29 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Theodosius accepted comparison with Hercules and Jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of Pacatus, and despite his active dismantling of Rome's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly Hellenic senate in traditional Hellenic terms.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} He was the last emperor of both East and West.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JNIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=pacatus+theodosius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cS8Cv0vBOb&amp;sig=z2ML87tEYOAa8iZPAJ5iWLX-LQI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nyaYSunGKKCQjAfHmbWzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pacatus%20theodosius&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk], Williams &amp; Friell, 65-67.

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

A '''religious cosmology''' (also  '''mythological cosmology''') is a way of explaining the [[creation myth|origin]], the history and the evolution of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]] based  on the [[Religion and mythology|religious mythology]] of a specific tradition. Religious cosmologies usually include an act or process of [[Creation myth|creation]] by a [[creator deity]] or a larger [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].

==Indian==
===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist cosmology}}

In [[Buddhism]], like other Indian religions, there is no ultimate beginning nor final end to the universe. It considers all existence as eternal, and believes there is no creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Anne M.|last2=Samuels|first2=Jeffrey|title=Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC|year=2003|publisher=Pariyatti|isbn=978-1-928706-19-9|pages= 128–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harvey |first=Peter |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=buddhism%20introduction&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |edition=2nd |isbn=9780521676748 |pages=36-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism views the universe as impermanent and always in flux. This cosmology is the foundation of its [[Samsara]] theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath.&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Trainor |title= Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7 |pages=62–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''niraya''), hungry ghosts (''pretas''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''manushya''), and gods (''devas'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''asuras'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms" respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;

The Hindu cosmology, like the Buddhist and Jain cosmology, considers all existence as cyclic.&lt;ref name="MichellDavies1989p37"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Michell|author2=Philip H.

''Neither being (sat) nor non-being was as yet. What was concealed?
And where? And in whose protection?…Who really knows?
Who can declare it? Whence was it born, and whence came this creation? 
The devas (demigods) were born later than this world's creation, 
so who knows from where it came into existence? None can know from where 
creation has arisen, and whether he has or has not produced it.
He who surveys it in the highest heavens, 
He alone knows or perhaps He does not know."

===Jain===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}

Jain cosmology considers the loka, or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, having no beginning or an end.&lt;ref&gt;“This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone; It is self sustaining, without any base or support” “Nishpaadito Na Kenaapi Na Dhritah Kenachichch Sah Swayamsiddho Niradhaaro Gagane Kimtvavasthitah” [Yogaśāstra of Ācārya Hemacandra 4.106] Tr by Dr. A. S. Gopani&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is narrow at the top, broad at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;See Hemacandras description of universe in Yogaśāstra “…Think of this loka as similar to man standing akimbo…”4.103-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for this quote:
"Some foolish men declare that a creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression."

Pangu emerged (or woke up) and separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the [[Earth]] (murky ''Yin'') and the [[Sky]] (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. After Pangu died, he became everything.

===Ex nihilo===

{{see also|Ex nihilo|Creationism}}

Around the time of Jesus or a little earlier, the Greek idea that God had actually created matter replaced the older idea that matter had always existed, but in a chaotic state. This concept, called ''[[creatio ex nihilo]]'', is now the accepted orthodoxy of most denominations of Judaism and Christianity. Most denominations of Christianity and Judaism believe that a single, uncreated God was responsible for the creation of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;One of the severest critics of religious cosmologies from the standpoint of physics was Adolf Grünbaum, 'The Poverty of Theistic Cosmology' (2004), now in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol. I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 7 (pp. 151-200); some earlier papers on the same subject can also be found in this volume&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genesis Creation Narrative===

The universe of the ancient Israelites was made up of a [[Flat Earth|flat disc-shaped earth]] floating on water, [[heaven]] above, [[underworld]] below.&lt;ref name="Aune2003p119"&gt;{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans inhabited earth during life and the underworld after death, and the underworld was morally neutral;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2002|pp=117,124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; only in [[Hellenistic]] times (after c.330 BC) did Jews begin to adopt the [[Hades|Greek idea]] that it would be a place of punishment for misdeeds, and that the righteous would enjoy an [[afterlife]] in heaven.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010 77–78"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2010|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period too the older three-level cosmology was widely replaced by the Greek concept of a [[spherical earth]] suspended in [[space]] at the [[geocentric|centre]] of a number of [[Celestial spheres|concentric heavens]].&lt;ref name="Aune2003p119"/&gt;

===Islam===

{{Main|Islamic cosmology|Sufi cosmology}}

[[File:Islamic cosmology.jpg|thumb|Cosmology according to [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]]. The Earth is considered flat and surrounded by a series of mountains—including [[Mount Qaf]]. Earth is supported by an ox that stands on Bahamut dwelling in a cosmic ocean; the ocean is inside a bowl that sits on top of an angel or [[jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;Zakariya al-Qazwini. ''ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt'' (The Wonders of Creation). Original published in 1553 AD&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Islam teaches that God created the universe, including Earth's physical environment and human beings. The highest goal is to visualize the cosmos as a book of symbols for meditation and contemplation for spiritual upliftment or as a prison from which the human soul must escape to attain true freedom in the spiritual journey to God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e459?_hi=10&amp;_pos=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Below here there are some other citations from the Quran on cosmology.

"And the heavens We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander." 51:47 Sahih International

"Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined 
together (as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder? We made 
from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?"
21:30 Yusuf Ali translation

"The day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books 
(completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a 
new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it."
21:104 Yusuf Ali translation

===Mormon===

{{Main|Mormon cosmology}}

The Earth's creation, according to Mormon scripture, was not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but organized from existing matter. The faith teaches that this earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and that there are many governing heavenly bodies, including a planet or star [[Kolob]] which is said to be nearest the throne of God. According to the [[King Follett discourse]], [[God the Father]] himself once passed through mortality like Jesus did, but how, when, or where that took place is unclear. The prevailing view among Mormons is that God once lived on a planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/beliefs/god_1.shtml "An explanation of Mormon beliefs about God"], [[BBC]] – Religions, 2009-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jana Riess and Christopher Kimball Bigelow, ''Mormonism for Dummies'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-7645-7195-4}}) ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Esoteric cosmology ==

'''Esoteric cosmology''' is [[cosmology]] that is an intrinsic part of an [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Occultism|occult]] system of thought. Esoteric cosmology maps out the universe with [[Plane (cosmology)|planes of existence]] and consciousness according to a specific worldview usually from a [[doctrine]].

==Gnosticism==

[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] teachings were contemporary with those of Neoplatonism. Gnosticism is an imprecise label, covering monistic as well as dualistic conceptions. Usually the higher worlds of Light, called the [[Pleroma]] or "fullness", are radically distinct from the lower world of Matter.  The emanation of the Pleroma and its godheads (called ''Aeons'') is described in detail in the various Gnostic tracts, as is the pre-creation crisis (a cosmic equivalent to the "fall" in [[Christianity|Christian]] thought) from which the material world comes about, and the way that the divine spark can attain salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guiley|first1=Rosemary Ellen|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=1438130260|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">'''Sacralism''' is the confluence of [[separation of church and state|church and state]] wherein one is called upon to change the other.

'''Christian sacralism''' is, according to Verduin,&lt;ref&gt;Verduin, Leonard ''The anatomy of a hybrid : a study in church-state relationships'', Grand Rapids, Mich. : Eerdmans, (1976) {{ISBN|0-8028-1615-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[multicultural|hybrid]] product that resulted from the colossal change known as the [[Constantinian shift]] that began early in the fourth century AD, when Christianity was granted official tolerance in the [[Roman Empire]] by the [[Emperor Constantine]], and was completed by the [[Emperor Theodosius]]'s declaration in 392 outlawing paganism and making Christianity the official religion of the Empire.

A [[Latin]] saying that has often been used to describe the principle of sacralism is '''''cuius regio, eius religio''''', or "who has region, decides religion." The idea was that the ruler of each individual area would decide the religion of those under his control based upon his own faith.

[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|Portion of the death shroud of [[Charlemagne]]. It represents a [[quadriga]] and was manufactured in [[Constantinople]].]]
'''Shroud''' usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to ''[[burial]] sheets'', '''mound shroud''', '''grave clothes''', '''winding-cloths''' or '''winding-sheets''', such as the famous [[Shroud of Turin]] or ''[[Tachrichim]]'' (burial shrouds) that [[Jews]] are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white [[cotton]], [[wool]] or [[linen]], though any material can be used so long as it is made of [[natural fibre]]. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Kolatch, ''The Jewish Book of Why'' (New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1981), pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; a proscription that ultimately derives from the [[Torah]], ''viz.'', [[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 22:11.

A traditional Orthodox Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter ''shin'', mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai.  Early shrouds incorporated a cloth, the ''sudarium'', that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or His friend, Lazarus ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11, ''q.v.'').  An especially pious man may next be enwrapped in either his [[kittel]] or his [[tallit]], one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 ''mitzvot'' (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a ''sovev'' in Hebrew (a cognate of ''svivon'', the spinning [[Hanukkah]] toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, ''[[dreidel]]''), before being placed either in a plain coffin of soft wood (where required by governing health codes) or directly in the earth.  [[Croesus]]-rich or dirt-poor, every Orthodox Jew is dressed to face the Almighty on the same terms.

The [[Early Christian Church]] also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. An account of the opening of the coffin of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] says that the "innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body". Their use was general until at least the Renaissance – clothes were very expensive, and they had the advantage that a good set of clothes was not lost to the family.
In Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design for Death|last=Jones|first=Barbara|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p.112, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthodox Christians]] still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the [[Trisagion]]. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox [[Holy Week]] services is called an [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]]. Some Catholics also use the burial shroud particularly the [[Eastern Catholics]] and traditionalist [[Roman Catholics]].

Muslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The [[Burying in Woollen Acts]] 1666-80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.

[[File:36-Visiting CFI library-Rare Books.JPG|thumb|Several early copies of ''The Age of Reason'']]

'''''The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology''''' is a work by English and American political activist [[Thomas Paine]], arguing for the philosophical position of [[Deism]]. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the [[Bible]]. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.

It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic [[revival meeting|revival]]. British audiences, fearing increased [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|political radicalism]] as a result of the [[French Revolution]], received it with more hostility. ''The Age of Reason'' presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the [[Christian]] Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of [[revelation]], leading him to reject [[miracle]]s and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text. It promotes [[natural theology|natural religion]] and argues for the existence of a creator-god.

Most of Paine's arguments had long been available to the [[educated]] [[elite]], but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to [[common people|the masses]]. Originally distributed as unbound [[pamphlet]]s, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many [[Freethought|free thinkers]].

==Historical context==

===Intellectual context: eighteenth-century British deism===
Paine's book followed in the tradition of [[deism#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|early eighteenth-century British deism]]. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in ''The Age of Reason''. The most important position that united the early deists was their call for "free rational inquiry" into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on [[freedom of conscience]], they demanded [[religious toleration]]&lt;!--a more specific link to the history of British toleration would be nice – anyone know of one? --&gt; and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a [[Isaac Newton#Effect on religious thought|Newtonian]] worldview, and they believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature.  Without a concept of [[physical law|natural law]], the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of [[miracle]]s. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the [[first cause]] or [[Cosmological argument|prime mover]], had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or "one true faith"; religion could only be "simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal" if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between "revealed religions" (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and "natural religion", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not [[atheism|atheists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 26–29; see also Claeys, 178–79; Kuklick, xiii. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

While some deists accepted [[revelation]], most argued that revelation's restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to these writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God's existence already apparent in the natural world, but more often it led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (these accusations were typically referred to as "[[Deism#History of religion and the deist mission|priestcraft]]"). The worst of these doctrines was [[original sin]]. By convincing people that they required a priest's help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 30–39; see also Claeys, 178–79. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political context: French revolution===
[[Image:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|alt=A caricature of French revolutionaries, showing two grotesque French peasants celebrating around a guillotine dripping with blood and surrounded by flames.|[[George Cruikshank|George Cruikshank's]] ''The Radical's Arms'' (1819), pillorying the excesses of the French revolution]]

By the time Part I of ''The Age of Reason'' was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Reign of Terror]] had begun, [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] had been tried and executed and [[First Coalition|Britain was at war with France]]. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. ''The Age of Reason'' belongs to this later, more radical stage of the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British political reform movement]], one that openly embraced [[republicanism]] and atheism&lt;ref&gt;Paine was not an atheist; nor were other deists.&lt;/ref&gt; and is exemplified by such texts as [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793). By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: [[Richard Price]], the [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), had died in 1791, and [[Joseph Priestley]] had been forced to flee to America after a [[Priestley Riots|Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Marilyn. ''Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries: English Literature and its Background 1760–1830''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] (1981), 49; Bindman, 118. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative government, headed by [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], responded to this increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for [[seditious libel]] and [[treason]] in the famous [[1794 Treason Trials]]. Following the trials and an attack on [[George III]], conservatives were successful in passing the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]] (also known as the "Two Acts" or the "gagging acts"). These acts prohibited [[freedom of assembly]] for groups such as the radical [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for "libelous and seditious" statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when [[Francis Place]] and other leaders helped Paine publish ''The Age of Reason''; the society's more religious members withdrew in protest and the LCS lost around one-fifth of its membership.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 148; Claeys, 190. (reference covers entire paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In December 1792, Paine's ''[[Rights of Man (book written by Thomas Paine)|Rights of Man, part II]]'' was declared [[seditious libel|seditious]] in Britain and he was forced to flee to France in order to avoid arrest.  Dismayed by the French revolution's turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of ''The Age of Reason'' in 1792 and 1793:
{{quote|
It has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion. ... The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity and of the theology that is true.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although Paine wrote ''The Age of Reason'' for the French, he dedicated it to his "Fellow Citizens of the United States of America", alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 210; see also Davidson and Scheick, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he says in the preface to Part II:
{{quote|
Conceiving... that I had but a few days of liberty, I sat down and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible; and I had not finished it more than six hours, in the state it has since appeared, before a guard came there, about three in the morning, with an order... for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner, and conveying me to the prison of the Luxembourg. I contrived, in my way there, to call on [[Joel Barlow]], and I put the Manuscript of the work into his hands...}}
According to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793,&lt;ref name=DS106&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt; but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793.&lt;ref name=Hawke2924&gt;Hawke, 292–94.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793.&lt;ref name=DS106/&gt; François Lanthenas, who translated ''The Age of Reason'' into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified.&lt;ref&gt;See Gimbel for a discussion of one possible copy of the 1793 French text.&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow published the first English edition of ''The Age of Reason, Part I'' in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Doubting Thomas': The Failure of Religious Appropriation in the Age of Reason|page=17|author=Adrianne Wadewitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the [[guillotine]] by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, xix–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[James Monroe]], at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794,&lt;ref&gt;Foot and Kramnick. 1987. ''The Thomas Paine Reader'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine immediately began work on Part II of ''The Age of Reason'', despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 [[Daniel Isaac Eaton]] published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one [[shilling]] and six pence. ([[1794 Treason Trials#Daniel Isaac Eaton|Eaton]] was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, [[Francis Place]] and Thomas Williams&lt;!--do not link - there is no page for this Thomas Williams--&gt; collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.&lt;ref name=Claeys1878&gt;Claeys, 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of ''The Age of Reason'': ''An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ''. Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, [[Thomas Jefferson]] convinced him not to publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.&lt;ref name=DS106/&gt;

Following Thomas Williams's sentence of one year's hard labor for publishing ''The Age of Reason'' in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when [[Richard Carlile]] included it in an edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom#Common law treatment|blasphemous libel]]. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of ''The Age of Reason'' in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Bronowski, Julius. ''William Blake and the Age of Revolution''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul (1965), 81; Claeys, 190; Wiener, 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and major arguments==
''The Age of Reason'' is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God.

He is turned towards the left and looking inquiringly out towards the viewer. He is wearing a dark red velvet jacket and a white shirt and there are papers next to him.]]
At the beginning of Part I of the ''Age of Reason'', Paine lays out his personal belief:
{{quote|
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.

I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow-creatures happy.

But, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.

I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.

All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Paine's creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims (miracles are specifically mentioned later in the text); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;As Walter Woll has noted in his book on Paine, there are "remarkable similarities" between Paine's creed and his friend [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]]; Woll, 138, note 1. Franklin's creed: "I believe in one God, the creator of the universe. That he governs it by his Providence. That he ought to be worshipped. That the most acceptable service we render to him is doing good to his other children. That the soul of man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason and revelation===
Paine begins ''The Age of Reason'' by attacking [[revelation]]. [[Revelation]], he maintains, can only be verified by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be "creation".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of ''The Age of Reason'', he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181–82; Davidson and Scheick, 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; For example Thomas Paine notes, " The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? "&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas; ''The Works of Thomas Paine'' (2008). ''The Age of Reason''.  pp. 52–53.  Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paine's analysis of the Bible====
After establishing that he would refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one would any other book. For example, in his analysis of the [[Book of Proverbs]] he argues that its sayings are "inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 60–61; see also Davidson and Scheick, 49; and Fruchtman, 3–4, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the Bible as "fabulous mythology", Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (he dismisses the idea that [[Moses]] wrote the [[Pentateuch]] or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).

{{quote|My intention is to show that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them; and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses, nor till several hundred years afterward; that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death of Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'', Part II, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Paine|title=The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77|year=1898|publisher=Truth Seeker Company|page=77|quote=My intention is to show that those books are spurious, and that Moses is not the author of them; and still further, that they were not written in the time of Moses, nor till several hundred years afterward; that they are no other than an attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived, and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship, several hundred years after the death of Moses, as men now write histories of things that happened, or are supposed to have happened, several hundred or several thousand years ago. (Image of [https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U3HlvD-qnSUJ-7Hy2E_b5Nc1Rewnw&amp;ci=130%2C605%2C730%2C413&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;77] at Google Books)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [...] The books called the Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...they have been manufactured, as the books of the Old Testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Paine|title=The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=he0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|year=1898|publisher=Truth Seeker Company|page=143|quote=But exclusive of this the presumption is that the books called the Evangelists, and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and that they are impositions.

Using methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century, Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency and questioned its historical accuracy, concluding that it was not divinely inspired.

Paine also argues that the [[Old Testament]] must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God. The "history of wickedness" pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human-authored myths.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181–82; Davidson and Scheick, 64–65, 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; He deplores people's credulity: "Brought up in habits of superstition," he wrote, "people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God." Citing [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:13–47 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women, and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls, at God's behest,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|31:13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine calls the Bible a "book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Vikki J.|title="My pen and my soul have ever gone together": Thomas Paine and the American Revolution|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=75|isbn=978-0-415-97652-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and the state===
[[Image:PaineRightsOfMan.png|thumb|right|180px|Title page from [[Thomas Paine|Paine's]] ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792)|alt=Title page from the Rights of Man]]
Paine also attacks religious [[Institution|institutions]], indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 207–09; Claeys, 181; Davidson and Scheick, 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' and ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', stating that "the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue."&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack distinguishes Paine's book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Hawke2924/&gt; He argues that the Church and the State are a single corrupt institution which does not act in the best interests of the people—both must be radically altered:
{{quote|Soon after I had published the pamphlet "Common Sense," in America, I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion. The adulterous connection of Church and State, wherever it has taken place ... has so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first principles of religion, that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world; but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would follow. Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes: "Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Mee, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions."&lt;ref name=DS1819&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's "secular [[millennialism]]" and it appears in all of his works—he ends the ''Rights of Man'', for example, with the statement: "From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of [[Revolution|revolutions]], in which everything may be looked for."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Foner, 216; see also Fruchtman, 157–58; Harrison, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," emphasizing the possibilities of "progress" and "human perfectibility" that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 91; see also Fruchtman, 157–58; Claeys, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paine's intellectual debts===
Although Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belie this statement;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 135–42.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age of Reason'' has intellectual roots in the traditions of [[David Hume]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Voltaire]]. Since Hume had already made many of the same "moral attacks upon Christianity" that Paine popularized in ''The Age of Reason'', scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 135–42; Davidson and Scheick, 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as "a positive source of harm to society" that "led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant".&lt;ref&gt;Hole, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza's ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise|Tractatus Theologico-politicus]]'' (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably [[Conyers Middleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, 140–41; Davidson and Scheick, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on ''The Age of Reason'', Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the [[deism#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|English deists of the early eighteenth century]], such as [[Peter Annet]].&lt;ref&gt;In Annet, Paine is said to have a direct "forerunner" in deistic argumentation, advocacy of "freedom of expression and religious inquiry" and emphasis on "social reforms." Annet even concerned himself with the price of one of his controversial religious pamphlets. Such a concern is worthy of Paine. (Herrick 130–34)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture, [[Matthew Tindal]] had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]] had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, [[Thomas Woolston]] had questioned the believability of miracles and [[Thomas Chubb]] had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in ''The Age of Reason'', albeit less coherently.&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 209; Davidson and Scheick, 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric and style==
The most distinctive feature of ''The Age of Reason'', like all of Paine's works, is its linguistic style. Historian [[Eric Foner]] argues that Paine's works "forged a new political language" designed to bring politics to the people, using a "clear, simple and straightforward" style.&lt;ref name=Foner16&gt;Foner, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine outlined "a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society" and his language reflected these ideals.&lt;ref name=Foner16/&gt; He originated such phrases as "the rights of man", "the age of reason", "the age of revolution", and "the times that try men's souls".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Foner also maintains that with ''The Age of Reason'' Paine "gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone".&lt;ref name=Foner247&gt;Foner, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

He did this by employing "[[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]]" (that is, "low" or "popular") language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to [[Elihu Palmer]], one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:
{{quote|
The hinting and intimidating manner of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind [religion], produced skepticism, but not conviction. It is necessary to be bold. Some people can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it. Say a bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Clark, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Paine's rhetoric had broad appeal; his "pithy" lines were "able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures" and become common quotations.&lt;ref name="Kuklick, xi–xii."&gt;Kuklick, xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of what makes Paine's style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions&lt;ref name="Kuklick, xi–xii."/&gt; in addition to the profusion of "anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and ... appeals to common sense".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of "we" conveys an "illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Vulgar" language===
The most distinctive element of Paine's style in ''The Age of Reason'' is its "[[wikt:vulgar|vulgarity]]". In the eighteenth century "vulgarity" was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity; thus, when Paine celebrates his "vulgar" style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] this way:
{{quote|
The Christian Mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the Garden of Eden, in the shape of a snake or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with Eve, who is no way surprised to hear a snake talk; and the issue of this tête-à-tête is that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that apple damns all mankind. After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have supposed that the Church Mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit: or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him (for they say that their faith can remove a mountain), or have put him ''under'' a mountain, as the former mythologists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief. But instead of this they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole—the secret of which is that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine-tenths of the world beside, and Mahomet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the Christian Mythology? Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in which none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded—put Satan into the pit—let him out again—gave him a triumph over the whole creation—damned all mankind by the eating of an apple, these Christian Mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and Man, and also the Son of God, celestially begotten, on purpose to be sacrificed, because they say that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis Paine's]
}}
The irreverent tone that Paine combined with this vulgar style set his work apart from its predecessors. It took "deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people".&lt;ref&gt;Foner, "Introduction," ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 35; see also Foot and Kramnick, 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's rhetorical appeal to "the people" attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Bishop Richard Watson]], forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine, ''An Apology for the Bible'', writes: "I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others, it was also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one [[seditious libel|sedition]] trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'', arguing that "although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Leslie Chard, "Bookseller to publisher: Joseph Johnson and the English book trade, 1760–1810." ''The Library'' (5th series) 32 (1977), 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreverent tone===
[[Image:WatsonApologycrop.png|right|thumb|Title page from the eighth edition of [[Richard Watson (bishop)|Bishop Watson's]] rejoinder to Paine|alt=Title page from "An Apology for the Bible"]]
Paine's style is not only "vulgar", it is also irreverent. For example, he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, "The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason,'' Part II, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a [[wit|refined wit]] rather than the broad humor Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, and not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, 52, 61–65, 80–81; Claeys, 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Paine's "ridiculing" tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: "the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Redwood, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, Watson's ''Apology'' directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:
{{quote|
I am unwilling to attribute bad designs, deliberate wickedness, to you or to any man; I cannot avoid believing, that you think you have truth on your side, and that you are doing service to mankind in endeavouring to root out what you esteem superstition. What I blame you for is this—that you have attempted to lessen the authority of the Bible by ridicule, more than by reason.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Religious influences===
Paine's [[Quaker]] upbringing predisposed him to [[deist]]ic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious [[English dissenters|Dissent]]. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the [[Simplicity in speech|Quakers' esteem for plain speaking]], a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in ''The Age of Reason'', influenced his writing even more. As the historian [[E. P. Thompson]] has put it, Paine "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; His description of the story of the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] demystifies biblical language: it is "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 156; see also Claeys, 102–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Quaker [[conversion narrative]]s also influenced the style of ''The Age of Reason''; Davidson and Scheick argue that its "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in ''The Age of Reason'', most importantly a [[millenarianism|millennial]] language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 183; Fruchtman, 4, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sermon]]ic quality of Paine's writing is one of its most recognizable traits. [[Sacvan Bercovitch]], a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine's writing often resembles that of the [[jeremiad]] or "political sermon". He contends that Paine draws on the [[Puritan]] tradition in which "theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;Bercovitch, Sacvan. ''The American Jeremiad''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press (1978), xiv; see also Fruchtman, xi.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a [[Methodist]] preacher, although this suspicion cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
''The Age of Reason'' provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.&lt;ref name=DS1819/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smylie, 210; Claeys, 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
[[Image:CruikshankPaine.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[George Cruikshank]] cartoon attacking Paine; The caption reads: "The Age of Reason; or, the World turned Topsy-turvy exemplified in Tom Paine's Works!"|alt=A caricature showing the world in flames, people hanged in the background, people burning and attacking a crucifix, a sign reading "No Christianity, No Religion, No King", and scores of people standing upside down.]]

Paine's ''Age of Reason'' sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of [[government]] prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I).&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 187–88; Davidson and Scheick, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading of the Bible]], citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks against Paine, describing him "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[English dissenters|Dissenters]] such as [[Joseph Priestley]] who had endorsed the arguments of the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' turned away from those presented in ''The Age of Reason''. Even the liberal ''[[Analytical Review]]'' was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 184–85, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to ''The Age of Reason'', some scholars have argued that [[Constantin Volney|Constantin Volney's]] deistic ''The Ruins'' (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as [[Thomas Spence|Thomas Spence's]] ''Pig's Meat'' and [[Daniel Isaac Eaton|Daniel Isaac Eaton's]] ''Politics for the People'') was actually more influential than ''The Age of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Mee, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Bindman, ''The Ruins'' "achieved a popularity in England comparable to ''Rights of Man'' itself".&lt;ref&gt;Bindman, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; One minister complained that "the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as ''The Age of Reason''] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments" (other popular reform causes).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Claeys, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until [[Richard Carlile|Richard Carlile's]] 1818 trial for publishing ''The Age of Reason'' that Paine's text became "the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators".&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of ''The Age of Reason'' into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have "sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the ''Age of Reason''".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Marsh, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century, points out, "at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The ''Age of Reason'' struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison, but spent six years instead because he refused any "legal conditions" on his release.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's new rhetoric came to dominate popular nineteenth-century radical journalism, particularly that of [[Freethought|freethinkers]], [[Chartism|Chartists]] and [[Robert Owen|Owenites]]. Its legacy can be seen in [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler|Thomas Wooler's]] radical periodical ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'', [[Richard Carlile|Richard Carlile's]] numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of [[William Cobbett]], [[Henry Hetherington|Henry Hetherington's]] periodicals the ''Penny Papers'' and the ''[[Poor Man's Guardian]]'', the works of the Chartist [[William Lovett]], [[George Holyoake|George Holyoake's]] newspapers and books on [[Robert Owen|Owenism]], and freethinker [[Charles Bradlaugh|Charles Bradlaugh's]] ''New Reformer''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 94; Wilson, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A century after the publication of ''The Age of Reason'', Paine's rhetoric was still being used: [[George William Foote|George Foote's]] "''Bible Handbook'' (1888) ... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's ''Age of Reason''."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the "absurdities of faith" could be "slain with laughter".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Marsh, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
''The Age of Reason'', despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that "the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article ... of every man's creed who has any creed at all – ''I believe in God''" (emphasis Paine's).&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Claeys, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Scheick, 88; Claeys, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in France, Paine formed the [[Theophilanthropy|Church of Theophilanthropy]] with five other families; this civil religion held as its central dogma that man should worship God's wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers.  It celebrated four festivals honoring [[Vincent de Paul|St. Vincent de Paul]], [[George Washington]], [[Socrates]], and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Woll 149; Claeys, 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Adams]] articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed "to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Harrison, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The church closed in 1801, when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] concluded a [[Concordat of 1801|concordat]] with the [[Pope|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Image:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]], often identified as an American [[deist]]|alt=1/4 length portrait of Jefferson in 1791, showing him with a shock of red hair and wearing a dark-colored jacket, a yellow vest, and a white shirt. He is looking off toward the left, away from the viewer.]]
In the United States, ''The Age of Reason'' initially caused a deistic "revival", but was then viciously attacked and largely forgotten. Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a "filthy little atheist" by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] over one hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the eighteenth century, America was ripe for Paine's arguments. [[Ethan Allen]] published the first American defense of deism, ''Reason, The Only Oracle of Man'' (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] espoused its tenets, while at the same time arguing that religion served the useful purpose of "social control".&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 8; Kuklick, xiii, xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the publication of Paine's more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 27, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age of Reason'' went through seventeen editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 256; see also Claeys, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elihu Palmer]], "a blind renegade minister" and Paine's most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country.  Palmer published what became "the bible of American deism", ''The Principles of Nature'',&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Foner writes that "''The Age of Reason'' became the most popular deist work ever written. ... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable."&lt;ref name=Foner247/&gt; Paine presented deism to the masses and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the [[Second Great Awakening]] began. George Spater explains that "the revulsion felt for Paine's ''Age of Reason'' and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century." By 1796 every student at [[Harvard]] was given a copy of Bishop Watson's rebuttal of ''The Age of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Spater, 10; see also Claeys, 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, [[Parson Weems]], an early American novelist and moralist, published ''God's Revenge Against Adultery'', in which one of the major characters "owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'".&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Samuels, 184."&gt;Qtd. in Samuels, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's "libertine" text leads the young man to "bold slanders of the bible", even to the point that he "threw aside his father's good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!"&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Samuels, 184."/&gt;

Paine could not publish part III of ''The Age of Reason'' in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the [[American Revolution]], Paine was now lambasted in the press and called "the scavenger of faction", a "lilly-livered sinical {{sic}} rogue", a "loathsome reptile", a "demi-human archbeast", "an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson]".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Foner, "Introduction," ''The Age of Reason'' (1974), 40; see also Claeys, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1805 [[John Adams]] wrote to his friend [[Benjamin Waterhouse]], an American physician and scientist:
{{quote|
I am willing you should call this the Age of Frivolity as you do, and would not object if you had named it the Age of Folly, Vice, Frenzy, Brutality, Daemons, Buonaparte {{sic}}, Tom Paine, or the Age of the Burning Brand from Bottomless Pit, or anything but the Age of Reason. I know not whether any man in the world has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine. There can be no severer satyr {{sic}} on the age. For such a mongrel between pig and puppy, begotten by a wild boar on a bitch wolf, never before in any age of the world was suffered by the poltroonery of mankind, to run through such a career of mischief. Call it then the Age of Paine.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hawke, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Adams viewed Paine's ''Age of Reason'' not as the embodiment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] but as a "betrayal" of it.&lt;ref&gt;Gaustad, Edwin S. ''Neither King nor Prelate: Religion and the New Nation, 1776–1826''. Grand Rapids, MI: [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] (1993), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul.  Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in ''The Age of Reason'': "pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message. ... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hawke, 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Age of Reason'' was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Thomas D. "Mark Twain and Robert Ingersoll: The Freethought Connection". ''American Literature'' 48.2 (1976): 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Moncure Daniel Conway]], who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C03E6D61E31E033A2575AC1A9609C94639ED7CF Review: Conway's Life of Thomas Paine]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 19 June 1892. Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Woll, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; As writer [[Mark Twain]] said, "It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the ''Age of Reason''...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power." Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, Harvey J. ''Thomas Paine and the Promise of America''. (Hill and Wang, 2005), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's text is still published today, one of the few eighteenth-century religious texts to be widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Its message still resonates, evidenced by [[Christopher Hitchens|Christopher Hitchens's]] statement that "if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason". His [[Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man": A Biography|2006 book on the ''Rights of Man'']] ends with the claim that "in a time ... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell, John. "[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n23/barr01_.html The Positions He Takes]." ''London Review of Books''. 28.23 (30 November 2006). Retrieved on 20 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
