'''20th-century Western painting''' begins with the heritage of late-19th-century painters [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and others who were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].

Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907; see gallery) Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal Cubism]] was a distilled form of Cubism consistent with a shift between 1915 and 1916 towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes, practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Fernand Léger]] and several other artists into the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of cubism, several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d’Automne, where his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was "founded" by [[André Breton]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80419 The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA Highlights, New York, revised 2004, originally published 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century, as Cubism evolved, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright|Macdonald-Wright]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] [[architecture]] and [[design]], to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from [[photography]] and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others.

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art [[theorist]], is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]], in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized—as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]]—that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled (as the example in the above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. [[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism).&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of Paul Klee. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of Kandinsky, Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include [[Czechs|Czech]] painter, [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read and exaggerated perspectives. A prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]]:

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]—friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately Matisse became the ''yang'' to Picasso's ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. The Fauves had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''The Green Line'' (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rosenthal (publisher)|Tom Rosenthal]], reviewing Derain's London paintings on show at the Courtauld Gallery, ''The Independent'' 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MunchDerToddesMarat1907.JPG|thumb|left|[[Edvard Munch]], ''Death of Marat I'' (1907), an example of [[Expressionism]]]]
By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on
the critics radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' William Rubin, published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Der Blaue Reiter was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]], a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of [[Die Brücke]] were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. This was a seminal group, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], Brücke Museum. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]],'' 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics encompassing several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern, and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of [[Expressionist]] and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]],'' (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] [[sculptor]], he made intense expressionist paintings as well.
In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. While [[Patrick Henry Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Gerald Murphy]] made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl New Yorker article, accessed online November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm accessed online August 28, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marsden Hartley]] experimented with [[expressionism]]. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his New York City gallery ''[[the 291]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/modart_2.shtm National Gallery of Art, retrieved November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement.

[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became the cause celebre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for [[chess]]) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hopkins|title=Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly,'' (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zürich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first [[Surrealist]] [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=2008-09-25 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in [[Latin America]], the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'' by Magritte is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its paradox. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/fr/14451967/andre_breton_manifeste_du_surrealisme/ André Breton, ''Manifeste du surréalisme'', various editions], BnF, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018''The Persistence of Memory''] in the MoMA Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."&lt;ref&gt;'André Breton, ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'', transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor, 1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Durozoi, History of the Surrealist Movement, transl. Alison Anderson (Chicago, 2002), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Ernst studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings, such as ''Murdering Airplane'' (1920), may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]]''. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text From the Tate Modern]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new Surrealist painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

[[American Scene painting]] and the [[Social Realism]] and [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self-portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others associated with the [[Berlin Secession]] politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=193 Neue Sachlichkeit, Tate glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other [[communist]] imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian—she was an avowed communist—they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings], retrieved 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia, then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the US until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] (as seen above) in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by [[Edward Hopper]] that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

===Abstract expressionism===

[[Image:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]],'' [[Abstract Expressionism]]]]
[[File:No 61 Mark Rothko.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[No. 61 (Rust and Blue)]],'' 1953, 115 cm × 92 cm (45 in × 36 in). [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[The Art of This Century Gallery]], as well as other factors.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and Synthetic Cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1][[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street,'' 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an [[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]].
[[Image:Dugmore-5313 hi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Dugmore]], ''Untitled'', 1954, 84 x 51 inches, San Francisco Bay area school of [[abstract expressionism]]]]
Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early twentieth century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.
Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic [[censorship]] in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

During the 1950s, Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early to mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea,'' from 1952, a seminal work of [[Colorfield painting]] by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) and [[Art Informel|Informalism]] took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

===Realism, Landscape, Figuration, Still-Life, Cityscape===
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Hopper]], ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942), [[Cityscape]]]]
During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Abstract Expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]] [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', currently in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This [[tempera]] work, done in a [[realist visual arts|realist]] style, is nearly always on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of what may be his friend [[Willem de Kooning]] (left) is an example of the evolution of [[Abstract Expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. In 1952 [[Michel Tapié]] authored the book ''Un Autre art'' which gave name and voice to [[Art Informel|Informalism]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

[[File:Greencocacola.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]], 1962, [[Pop Art]]]]

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for Pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' now is in the collection of [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Also featuring thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Sidney Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 a historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of Pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] [[work of art]] that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20&amp;nbsp;inches in height x 16&amp;nbsp;inches in width (50.8 x 40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) and each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in [[Pop art]] as a major [[art movement]] that relied on themes from [[popular culture]]. These works by [[Andy Warhol]] are repetitive and they are made in a non-painterly commercial manner.

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', p.119-122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by W.W.Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] whose paintings emerged from England during the 1960s like ''[[A Bigger Splash]],'' and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.

While in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction and seen in ordinary [[comic books]] and in paintings like ''Drowning Girl'', 1963, in the gallery above. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1,'' 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in [[California]]. Although throughout the 20th-century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Neo-Dada is a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Colorfield painting]], and [[Minimal Art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.


[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials] accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and [[Al Held]] are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the Minimalism of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Bridget Riley]] and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.
Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Color Field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Morris Louis]] and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat''is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. From 1960 [[Frank Stella]] produced paintings in [[aluminum]] and [[copper]] paint and are his first works using [[shaped canvas]]es (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (67), for example. Also in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (71) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the [[shaped canvas]].

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web] retrieved June 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of [[Fluxus]], Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal Art]], Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] shares similarities with Color Field painting and Abstract Expressionism especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from Abstract Expressionism and Action Painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in Action Painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight'' (above), there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]] and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Monochrome, minimalism, postminimalism===

Kelly was a pioneer of [[hard-edge painting]] in the 1940s and 1950s.]]

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman,  Jim Long, ''George Ortman''], The Brooklyn Rail, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.

This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

===Neo-expressionism===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/philip-guston-1231 Philip Guston, the Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm the art story, neo=expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 Tate online glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1990s the [[Stuckists]], a group that emerged late in 1990s respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2,'' 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter. ''A Matter of Horsepower'', ''Newsweek'', Retrieved June 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

"'''A Cyborg Manifesto'''" is an essay written by [[Donna Haraway]] and published in 1985. In it, the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating "human" from "animal" and "human" from "machine." She writes: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust."&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt;

The ''Manifesto'' criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly feminist focuses on [[identity politics]], and encouraging instead coalition through affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics; consequently, the "Manifesto" is considered one of the milestones in the development of feminist [[posthumanist]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrando|first=Francesca|title=Posthumanism|journal=Kilden Journal of Gender Research|date=2014|volume=2|pages=168–172|url=https://www.academia.edu/8041656/POSTHUMANISM|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major points==
[[File:Donna Haraway and Cayenne.jpg|thumb|Haraway, the author, in 2006]]
Haraway begins the ''Manifesto'' by explaining three boundary breakdowns since the 20th Century that have allowed for her hybrid, cyborg myth: the breakdown of boundaries between human and animal, animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution has blurred the lines between human and animal; 20th Century machines have made ambiguous the lines between natural and artificial; and microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have confused the lines of physicality.&lt;ref name="fulltext"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html Full text of the article "Cyborg Manifesto"] (an archived copy, in the [[Wayback Machine]]).  It is the full text of the article: {{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|authorlink=Donna Haraway|title=Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century|isbn=0415903866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues with Western patriarchal tenets===
Haraway highlights the problematic use and justification of Western traditions like [[patriarchy]], [[colonialism]], [[essentialism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] (among others). These traditions in turn allow for the problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]) and what Haraway explains as "antagonistic dualisms" that order Western discourse. These dualisms, Haraway states, "have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all [those] constituted as others." She highlights specific problematic dualisms of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these dualisms are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic dualisms.

===Cyborg theory===
Haraway's cyborg theory rejects the notions of essentialism, proposing instead a chimeric, monstrous world of fusions between animal and machine. Cyborg theory relies on writing as "the technology of cyborgs," and asserts that "cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism." Instead, Haraway’s cyborg calls for a non-essentialized, material-semiotic metaphor capable of uniting diffuse political coalitions along the lines of affinity rather than identity. Following Lacanian feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Haraway’s work addresses the chasm between feminist discourses and the dominant language of Western patriarchy. As Haraway explains, “grammar is politics by other means,” and effective politics require speaking in the language of domination.&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

As she details in a chart of the paradigmatic shifts from modern to postmodern epistemology within the Manifesto, the unified human subject of identity has shifted to the hybridized posthuman of technoscience, from “representation” to “simulation,” “bourgeois novel” to “science fiction,” “reproduction” to “replication,” and “white capitalist patriarchy” to “informatics of domination.”&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt; While Haraway’s “ironic dream of a common language” is inspired by Irigaray’s argument for a discourse other than patriarchy, she rejects Irigaray’s essentializing construction of woman-as-not-male to argue for a linguistic community of situated, partial knowledges in which no one is innocent.

===Criticism of traditional feminism===
Haraway takes issue with some traditional feminists, reflected in statements describing how "women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological (relating to the theory of knowledge) position potentially." The views of traditional feminism operate under the totalizing assumptions that all men are one way, and women another, whereas "a cyborg theory of wholes and parts," does not desire to explain things in total theory. Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism, criticizing feminist tactics as "identity politics" that victimize those excluded, and she proposes that it is better strategically to confuse identities. 
Her criticism mainly focuses on socialist and radical feminism. The former, she writes, achieves "to expand the category of labour to what (some) women did" Socialist feminism does not naturalize but rather builds a unity that was non-existent before -namely the woman worker.
On the other hand, radical feminism, according to Catherine MacKinnon, describes a world in which the woman only exists in opposition to the man. The concept of woman is socially constructed within the patriarchal structure of society and woman only exist because men have made them exist. The woman as a self does not exist. 
Haraway criticizes both when writing that "my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice" and "MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring" (299).  H&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also indirectly critiques [[white feminism]] by highlighting the struggles of women of color: she suggests that a woman of color “might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her ‘biomythography.’"&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

To counteract the essentializing and anachronistic rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists, who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.

===Call to action===
Haraway calls for a revision of the concept of gender, moving away from Western patriarchal essentialism and toward "the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender," stating that "Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth."&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also calls for a reconstruction of identity, no longer dictated by naturalism and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] but instead by affinity, wherein individuals can construct their own groups by choice. In this way, groups may construct a "post-modernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity" as a way to counter Western traditions of exclusive identification.

== Updates and revisions ==
Although Haraway's metaphor of the cyborg has been labelled as a post-gender statement, Haraway has clarified her stance on [[post-genderism]] in some interviews.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Haraway Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-96688-4|location=|pages=321–341|chapter='Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations' and 'There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies'|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledges that her argument in the ''Manifesto ''seeks to challenge the necessity for categorization of gender, but does not correlate this argument to post-genderism. She clarifies this distinction because post-genderism is often associated with the discourse of the utopian concept of being beyond masculinity and femininity. Haraway notes that gender constructs are still prevalent and meaningful, but are troublesome and should therefore be eliminated as categories for identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Applications of ''The Cyborg''==
Although Donna Haraway intended her concept of the cyborg to be a feminist critique, she acknowledges that other scholars and popular media have taken her concept and applied it to different contexts. Haraway is aware and receptive of the different uses of her concept of the cyborg, but admits "very few people are taking what I consider all of its parts".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'' overlooked the feminist theory of the cyborg and instead used it to make a more literal commentary about the enmeshment of humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kunzru|first=Hari|title=You Are Cyborg|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffharaway_pr.html|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Haraway also recognizes  that new feminist scholars "embrace and use the cyborg of the manifesto to do what they want for their own purposes".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "Patchwork Girl" ===
[[File:Shelley Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shelley Jackson]], author of ''Patchwork Girl.'']]

[[Patchwork Girl (hypertext)|Patchwork Girl]], a hypertext work, makes use of elements from ''Cyborg Manifesto''. ''Patchwork Girl's'' "thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is apparent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scarred and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line...Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its 'limbs' or links to different sections of the text."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Jackson's narrative, the Patchwork Girl is an aborted female monster created by [[Victor Frankenstein]] of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus]], ''is an abhorrent and monstrous creature that is "part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and 'razed' up through hypertext technology."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The monster, following her destruction by Victor, is sewn back together by [[Mary Shelley]] herself, while simultaneously becoming Mary's lover; she is thus, "a cyborg who is queer, dis-proportioned, and visibly scarred. She both facilitates and undermines preoccupations with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to 'catch' and one day prevent."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Patchwork Girl embraces Haraway's conception of a cybernetic posthuman being in both her physical multiplicity and her challenge towards "the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== "Cyborg Goddesses" ===
Turkish critical scholar Leman Giresunlu uses Haraway's cyborg as framework to examine current science fiction movies such as ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]] ''and [[Resident Evil]] in her essay "Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giresunlu|first=Leman|title=Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|year=2009|pages=157–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this essay, she explores how her new concept of the ''cyborg goddess, ''a female figure "capable of inflicting pain and pleasure simultaneously",'' '' can be used to make sense of how female representation is shifting towards a more multidimensional stance. Giresunlu builds from Haraway's cyborg because the ''cyborg goddess'' goes beyond "offering a way out from [the] duality" and instead provides how spirituality and technology work together to form a complex and more accurate representation of women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== "Mind Over Matter" ===
In her essay "Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man", American critical scholar Ruthellen Cunnally uses Haraway's cyborg to help make sense of how Robert Scott Carey, the protagonist of ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', transforms into a cyborg in the midst of a metaphor of cold war politics in his home. As Robert continues to shrink, the gendered power dynamic between him and his wife Louise shifts from "the realm of husband/wife into the mode of mother/son".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunnally|first=Ruthellen|title=Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|date=March 2013|doi=10.1080/01956051.2012.674070|volume=41|pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Robert finds himself lost in the feminine space of the basement, an area of the house that was reserved for Louise's domestic duties of sewing and washing, he is forced to fight for his life and reclaim his masculinity. Although he is able to conquer some of his foes and regain his "manhood", the gender lines do not become established again because there is no one to share and implement the gendered power structure with. Robert's transformation presents "an existence in which acceptance and meaning are released from the limitations of patriarchal dualisms", which aligns with Haraway's cyborg.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Traditional feminists have criticized "A Cyborg Manifesto" as anti-feminist because it denies any commonalities of the female experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the ''Manifesto,'' Haraway writes "there is nothing about being 'female' that naturally binds women",&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt; which goes against a defining characteristic of traditional feminism that calls women to join together in order to advocate for members of their gender.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Criticism and controversy were built into the essay's publication history: the East Coast Collective of the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' found the piece "a naive embrace of technology" and advocated against its publication, while The Berkeley Collective ultimately insisted that it go to print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay has been described as "controversial" and "viral" in its circulation through multiple academic departments and disciplinary boundaries, contributing to the critical discourse on its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Joseph|title=Haraway's Viral Cyborg|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=295|jstor=23333459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This controversiality was matched by its omnipresence; Jackie Orr, Associate Professor of Sociology at the [[Maxwell School of Syracuse University]], writes, "It is hard to be a feminist graduate student in the U.S. humanities or social sciences after 1985 and not be touched in some way by the cyborg manifesto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=276|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid adoption of the article in academic circles also increased the pace of the critical conversation surrounding the work, and in 1990, Haraway felt that the essay had "acquired a surprise half life," which made it "impossible to rewrite" and necessitated revisiting the topic in her subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandy|first1=Matthew|title=The Persistence of Complexity: Re-reading Donna Haraway's ''Cyborg Manifesto''|journal=AA Files|date=2010|volume=60|page=42|jstor=41378495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critiques of "A Cyborg Manifesto" focus on a basic level of reader comprehension and writing style, such as Orr's observation that "undergraduate students in a science and technology class find the cyborg manifesto curiously relevant but somewhat impenetrable to read." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=275|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, M. Gail. "The Work of Love: Feminist Politics and the Injunction to Love." ''Opting for the Margins: Postmodernity and Liberation in Christian Theology.'' [[Joerg Rieger]], ed. Oxford University Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This is corroborated by Helen Merrick and Margret Grebowicz's observation that scientists who reviewed ''Primate Visions'' had similar issues, particularly as related to Haraway's use of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grebowicz|first1=Margret|last2=Merrick|first2=Helen|title=Beyond the Cyborg: Adventures with Donna Haraway.|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York: NY|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWm0w4x1fDEC&amp;dq|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Wajcman]], Professor of Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], suggests in ''TechnoFeminism'' that "the openness of her writing to a variety of readings is intentional," which "can sometimes make Haraway difficult to interpret;" however, it does not seem that Wajcman critiques Haraway's tone for its capability to encompass more possibilities, rather than limit them. Wajcman concludes her chapter "Send in the Cyborgs" on a critical note, claiming that "Certainly, Haraway is much stronger at providing evocative figurations of a new feminist subjectivity than she is at providing guidelines for a practical emancipatory politics." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wajcman|first1=Judy|title=TechnoFeminism|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/TechnoFeminism.html?id=I63wvqQyHQcC|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations and There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96688-4|pages=321–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Haraway have also centered on the accessibility of the thematic topics she discusses in her writing, and according to third-wave feminist readings, her work "assumes a reader who is familiar with North American culture," and posits that "readers without the appropriate cultural capital are...likely to find it infuriatingly obscure and impenetrable."&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Therefore, Haraway's symbolism is representative of North American culture symbolizing a "non-universalizing vision for feminist strategies" and "has been taken up within cyberfeminism as the symbol of an essential female being." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Considering the question of accessibility more broadly, disability studies have focused on Haraway's essay, noting the absence of "any kind of critical engagement with disability...disabled bodies are simply presented as exemplary...requiring neither analysis nor critique"—a gap which Alison Kafer, Professor of Feminist Studies at Southwestern University, attempts to address in ''Feminist, Queer, Crip''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wajcman also argues that Haraway's view of technology in "A Cyborg Manifesto" is perhaps too totalizing, and that the binary of "the cyborg solution and the goddess solution" ultimately "caricatures feminism" by focusing too readily on a dichotomy that may in fact be a false one.&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt;

In ''Unfinished Work-From Cyborg to Cognisphere'',  N. Katherine Hayles questions the validity of cyborg as a unit of analysis. She says that because of the complicated situation of technology and media, “cyborg is no longer the individual person – or for that matter, the individual cyborg – is no longer the appropriate unit of analysis, if indeed it ever was.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=Katherine|date=|title=Unfinished Work: From Cyborg to Cognisphere|url=|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23.7-8|pages=159–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the relationships between cyborg and religion, Robert A. Campbell argues that “in spite of Haraway's efforts to move beyond traditional Western dualisms and offer a new hope for women, and by extension a of humanity and the world, what she in fact offers is a further legitimation for buying into the not so new American civil religion of high technology.” He says that “in spite of what some may view as a radical critique of the present and a potentially frightening prescription for the future, the stark reality about Haraway's 'postmodern reality' is that there is no such thing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Robert A.|date=2001|title=CYBORG SALVATION HISTORY: Donna Haraway and the Future of Religion|url=|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|volume=26| issue =  1/2|pages=154–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonographic fetus as cyborg ===
Scholar Marilyn Maness Mehaffy writes that the "sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is 'created' in a space of virtuality that straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehaffy | first1 = Marilyn Maness | year = 2000 | title = Fetal attractions: the limit of cyborg theory | url = | journal = Women's Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 177–194 | doi=10.1080/00497878.2000.9979307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway's posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, "is publicly envisioned as both independent of [its mother's] body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Latimer, Heather. "Reproductive Technologies, Fetal Icons, and Genetic Freaks: Shelley Jackson’s Patchwork Girl and the Limits and Possibilities of Donna Haraway’s Cyborg." Modern Fiction Studies 57.2 (2011): 318-335.&lt;/ref&gt; In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies "reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Valerie Hartouni argues, "most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the 'order of nature'"&lt;ref&gt;Hartouni, Valerie. Cultural Conceptions: On Reproductive Technologies and the Remaking of Life. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which would make Haraway's vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.

== Publication history ==
Haraway began writing the ''Manifesto ''in 1983 to address the ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]] ''request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of [[socialist feminism]] in the context of the early [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the ''Socialist Review ''East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley ''Socialist Review'' Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The essay was most widely read as part of Haraway's 1991 book ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simians, cyborgs, and women: the reinvention of nature.|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0415903875 |location=New York|pages=149–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4376">In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], an '''action group''' or '''task group''' is a group of people joined temporarily to accomplish some task or take part in some organized [[collective action]].

As the members of the action group are brought together on a single occasion and then disband, they cannot be regarded as constituting a full-fledged [[social group]], for which they would need to interact recurrently in accordance with their [[social identity|social identities]].

==In shareholder context==
Action Groups are often formed by many [[shareholder]]s when they disagree with actions by the [[Board of Directors]] of a [[Public Company]] or the [[Government]] like the forced [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225142734/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |archivedate=2009-12-25 }} Appeal bid denied for Northern Rock shareholders".

[[Institutional investor]]s often find loose alliances with private investor lead shareholder association actions groups useful in applying mass political pressure or to publicly embarrass Directors at [[Annual general meeting]]s into making changes.

The largest established shareholder action group associations are Sveriges Aktiesparares Riksförbund (the Swedish Shareholders' Association) part of the Euroshareholders group in the UK ShareSoc and UKSA (UK Shareholder Association),. American Shareholders Association, [[Australian Shareholders Association]], and Japan [[Sōkaiya]] also have action groups.

==In Latin American context==
In Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America, the word "action group" ({{lang|es|grupo de acción}}) was given to violent activists who gathered together to perform violent guerrilla activities e.g. (see [[Antonio Guiteras]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Emilio Tro]], [[Lauro Blanco]], and [[Rolando Masferrer]] when young university students) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050817112813/http://www.cadal.org/articulos/nota.asp?id_nota=290][http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjs098.php].

{{italictitle}}
'''''Antidosis''''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίδοσις}}), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Isocrates]].  The ''Antidosis'' can be viewed as a defense, an [[autobiography]], or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography.  The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient [[Greece|Greek]] courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_law_glossary?page=5&amp;greekEncoding= ''Antidosis'' as an Ancient Athenian legal term]&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of [[Athens]], then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it.  If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the [[liturgy]], as originally planned.  The law inspired Isocrates' ''Antidosis'', which was written in the form of a [[Legal case|court case]] where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers.  Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on [[morality]] and teaching.

== As a Court Case ==
Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what [[crime]] he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty.  Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good [[teacher]] to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed.  There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.

Another idea by scholars is that early on in the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students.  He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves.  Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students.  In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders.  Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens.  Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him.  Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B. Keith. "Isocrates." Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. &lt;http://www.keithmurphy.info/399/Isoc.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching.  He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the [[education]] that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens.  His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated [[Citizenship|citizen]]s that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state.  For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.

== As an Autobiography ==
Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote ''Antidosis'', the longest work of his life.  Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens.  Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric.  Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where [[Public speaking|oratory]] is used in a way to bring many different cases of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the [[republic]] was run.  He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into [[Democracy|democratic]] politics.

The ''Antidosis'' is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial.  While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the ''Antidosis'', many aspects of the case were fictionalized.  Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused.  According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the ''Antidosis''-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.”&lt;ref&gt;Norlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay.  Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was.  He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure.  This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the ''Antidosis'' in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him.  In the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers.  With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government.  This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.

==As a Rhetorical Treatise==
Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be [[praise]]d.  This directly opposes [[Gorgias]]’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them.  

At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and [[Gambling|tossing dice]] in gambling dens.”  He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on [[society]] and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.

Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.

==Commentary==
D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2011/06/antidosis-and-protrepticus.html|title=Antidosis and Protrepticus|year=2011|authors=D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Ransome Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Aristotle’s Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato’s Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the “elements” or “principles” of nature were useful as “mental gymnastic” for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates’ attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.''

'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).

The definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]’s  “rapid fading” [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.

But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   

This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    

It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.

Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.

'''Biological functionalism''' is an [[anthropological]] paradigm, asserting that all [[social organisation|social institutions]], beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |title=The Meaning of "Life" |author=Austin, D.F. |year=2000 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005750/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established [[structural functionalism]], yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-rathouse.com/EvenMoreAustrianProgram/EMACulturevsGMProg.html |title=Comparing "The Strong Program in Cultural Theory |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both maintain the fundamental belief that a [[social structure]] is composed of many interdependent [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a [[solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]] and collective conscience is required in a functioning system.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

==Everyday application==
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still [[self-preservation]], albeit unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |title=Biological Adaptation in Human Societies: A 'Basic Needs' Approach |author=Corning, Peter A. |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082133/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychological]] motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

{{Anthropology of kinship |terms}}
{{main|Kinship}}

'''Classificatory kinship''' systems, as defined by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], put people into society-wide [[kinship]] classes on the basis of abstract relationship rules. These may have to do with [[genealogy|genealogical]] relations locally (e.g., son to father, daughter to mother, daughter to father) but the classes bear no overall relation to genetic closeness. If a total stranger marries into the society, for example, they may simply be placed in the appropriate class opposite to their spouse.
It uses kinship terms that merge or equate relatives who are genealogically distinct from one another. Here, the same term is used for different kin.

The [[Kinship terminology|Dravidian kinship-term]] system, discovered in 1964, is an example of a classificatory kin-term logic.

Founded in 1975, the '''Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment''' sought to replace the [[Massachusetts]] State ERA Coalition and carry out the mission of ratifying the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment replaced the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition because, as a coalition, the organization could not legally raise funds for any cause. The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu//oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&amp;uniqueId=sch00522|title=Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment. Records of the Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment, 1975-1976: A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee then became the ERA Implementation Project, which lobbied for reconciliation of existing laws with the ERA vis a vis legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_equal_rights_amendment |title=Home - Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) - Research Guides at Harvard Library |publisher=Guides.library.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copperplate''' is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing most commonly associated with [[Round hand|English Roundhand]].

==History==
The first use of the term "Copperplate" was in [[Ambrose Heal|Sir Ambrose Heal]]'s 1931 work ''The English Writing-Masters and Their Copy-Books 1570-1800'', although the term may have been used earlier. The term derives from the practice of engraving English roundhand onto a copper plate, also known as intaglio printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iampeth.com/lesson/business-handwriting/styles-script|title=Styles of Script|website=[[IAMPETH]]|first=Joseph|last=Vitolo|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tihanyi The Critic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Critic'' by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]. Oil on canvas, c.1916.]]

A '''critic''' is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from [[critical thinking]] or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theatre and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' and ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a Feminist or Freudian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdP2BgxsM3wC|title=The Feminist Spectator as Critic|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=2012-10-24|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472035193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "[[pundits]]" instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails some [[subjectivity]]. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public [[arbitration|arbiter]] of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word "critic" comes {{ety|gre|''κριτικός'' (kritikós)|able to discern}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkritiko%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Kritikos'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a Greek derivation of the word {{lang|grc|κριτής}} ''(krités)'', meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkrith%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Krites'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Critics' views of criticism ==

Cultural critic [[Clement Greenberg]] wrote that a good critic excels through "insights into the evidence … and by … loyalty to the relevant"; poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] wrote "a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art and Culture – Critical Essays|last = Greenberg|first = Clement|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1961|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 239|chapter = T.S. Eliot: A Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Harold C.

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" that puts "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is "not about me liking it or not; it's about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-role-of-a-restaurant-critic-in-the-digital-age-20161201-gt1ndf.html|title=The role of a restaurant critic in the digital age|last=Durack|first=Terry|date=3 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], for example, prior to the [[French Revolution]], used his play [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|''The Marriage of Figaro'']] to denounce aristocratic privilege. A critic's influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais's play (''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] [[satire]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and [[George Orwell]]'s satire ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Some political critics, such as [[Ai Weiwei]] use visual art as their medium. Throughout history, political critics have faced higher risks, including the risk of imprisonment or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hrw-calls-for-release-of-thai-government-critic/3238970.html|title=HRW Calls for Release of Thai Government Critic|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/03/21/zambian-opposition-leader-arrested-for-defaming-president-lungu/|title=Zambian opposition leader arrested for ‘defaming’ President Lungu|website=africanews.channel|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistanis-throng-for-funeral-of-man-hanged-for-killing-critic-of-blasphemy-laws-1456855688|title=Pakistanis Throng Funeral of Man Hanged for Killing Critic of Blasphemy Laws|last=Shah|first=Saeed|last2=Nauman|first2=Qasim|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nemtsov-idUSKCN0W00M4|title=Thousands march in Moscow to honor slain Kremlin critic Nemtsov|date=2016-02-28|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/beijing-critic-family-detained-china-internet-crackdown/3256261.html|title=Beijing Critic Says Family Detained in China in Internet Crackdown|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online critics ==

Several websites have developed for the purpose of compiling or publishing original critical reviews. Examples include ''[[Blogcritics|BlogCritics Magazine]]'', [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and [[Yelp]]. According to [[A. O.

== Responses to critics ==

People whose work is the subject of criticism have a full range of responses to it. For example, they may be appreciative, offended, distressed, encouraged, amused or nonplussed.
{{Quotebox|quote=''We do not object to criticism; and we do not expect that the critic will read the book before writing a notice of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6244">'''Cybertext''' is the organization of text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the [[literary]] dynamic, as defined by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997. Aarseth defined it as a type of [[ergodic literature]].

==Definition==
The term cybertext was coined by [[speculative fiction]] poetry author [[Bruce Boston]].  It is derived from the word [[cybernetics]], which was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his book ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (1948), which in turn comes from the Greek word ''kybernetes'' – [[helmsman]].&lt;ref name=espen1997&gt;{{cite book|author=Aarseth, Espen|year=1997|title=Ergodic Literature|publisher=Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-5579-9 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qx_-zj0-TwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0801855799&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;!-- previous url http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html dead--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertexts are pieces of literature where the medium matters. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel, the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user', just a 'reader', this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what to do, what punches to punch, or when to jump. The difference between a game and a cybertext is that cybertexts usually have more depth, there is a method to the madness, the piece usually has a point, or message that is translated to the reader as they work their way through the piece.

==Overview==
Cybertext is based on the idea that getting to the message is just as important as the message itself. In order to obtain the message work on the part of the user is required. This may also be referred to as nontrivial work on the part of the user.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt;

The fundamental idea in the development of the theory of cybernetics is the concept of [[feedback]]: a portion of [[information]] produced by the system that is taken, total or partially, as input. Cybernetics is the science that studies control and regulation in systems in which there exists flow and feedback of information. Though first used by [[science fiction]] poet [[Bruce Boston]], the term cybertext was brought to the [[Literature|literary]] world's attention by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Eskelinen, Markuu and Koskimaa, Raine,(January, 2010) Retrieved from Cybertext Yearbook Database website: http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/search.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarseth's concept of cybertext focuses on the organization of the text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the literary dynamic. According to Aarseth, cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], we should inspect [[Plain text|texts]] at a much more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter,Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The concept of cybertext offers a way to expand the reach of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] to include phenomena that are perceived today as foreign or marginal.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt; In Aarseth's work, cybertext denotes the general set of text machines which, operated by readers, yield different texts for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, Jim. Article on: Navigating Nowhere / Hypertext Infrawhere retrieved from:  http://www.well.com/user/jer/NNHI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, with a book like  [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]'', each reader will encounter not just [[Poetry|poems]] arranged in a different order, but ''different poems'' depending on the precise way in which they turn the sections of page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queneau's Poems|url=http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauHome_v2.html|accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of a cybertext is ''12 Blue'' by [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. Depending on what link you choose or what portion of the [[diagram]] on the side you pick you will be transferred to a different portion of the text. So in the end, you do not really finish reading the entire story or 'novel' you go through random pages and try piecing the story together yourself. You may never really 'finish' the story. But, because it is a cybertext the 'finishing' of the story is not as important as its impact on the reader, or on the conveyance.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce,Michael. ''12 Blue'' Retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/joyce__twelve_blue.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stir Fry Texts'', by Jim Andrews, is a cybertext where there are many layers of text, and as you move your mouse over the words, the layers beneath them are 'dug' through.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews,Jim. Article on Stir Fry Texts retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/andrews__stir_fry_texts/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
''The House'' is another example of a cybertext where one might assume a description of the piece as follows:
It is an unruly text, the words don't listen, you are not supreme. You are guided through the piece. This is a cybertext with minimal control. You watch as something unfolds before you, "a crumbling mania", you must be able to go with the flow, to read texts upside down, to piece together a reflection of words, to be okay with texts half read disappearing or moving so far away so continuously that you can not make out those very important words.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Mary. The House, retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/flanagan__thehouse/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary anthropology''' is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominids]] and non-hominid [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]]. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology are:

* [[Human evolution]] and [[anthropogeny]].
* [[Paleoanthropology]] and [[paleontology]] of both human and non-human primates.
* [[Primatology]] and primate [[ethology]].
* The [[sociocultural evolution]] of [[human behavior]].
* The [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] of humans.
* The [[archaeological]] study of human technology and change over time and space.
* [[Human evolutionary genetics]] and changes in the [[human genome]] over time.
* The [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[neuroanthropology]] of human and primate cognition, culture and actions and abilities.
* [[Human behavioural ecology]] and the interaction of humans and the environment.
* Studies of human [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors.

Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], primatology, and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of biological evolution generally concern the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporate [[cultural transmission]] models. Note that cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution, and that human culture involves the transmission of cultural information, which behaves in ways quite distinct from [[human biology]] and [[genetics]]. The study of cultural change is increasingly performed through [[cladistics]] and genetic models.

== History ==
In 1973, feminist scholar [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] wrote an influential essay, ''The Rhetoric of Women’s Liberation: An Oxymoron'', that drew feminists' attention to women's role as communicators within rhetorical frameworks, and to the relevance of feminist theory to the study of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer | first=Michaela D. E. | title=Women Speak(ing): Forty Years of Feminist Contributions to Rhetoric and an Agenda for Feminist Rhetorical Studies | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=55 | issue=1 | date=2007-02-27 | issn=0146-3373 | doi=10.1080/01463370600998293 | pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar [[Patricia Bizzell]] noted in 1992 that classical canon of rhetoric consists almost entirely of well-educated male authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bizzell|first1=Patricia|date=1992|title=Opportunities for Feminist Research in the History of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminist rhetoric scholars argued that the world of rhetoric was suffused with patriarchal values. To address this perceived problem, they made efforts to include women authors in the history of rhetoric; pointed out connections between feminist issues and theories of rhetoric; and wrote rhetorical criticism from feminist perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-feminist-rhetoric-1690791|title=Feminist Rhetoric|last1=Nordquist|first1=Richard|website=Thought Co.|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics were initially inspired by feminist scholarship outside of rhetoric and composition studies, but eventually developed a distinctive school within this tradition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the initial feminist rhetoric movement, the Coalition of Women (later Feminist) Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition was formed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to its mission statement, this coalition “fosters inquiry in the histories, theories, and pedagogues of rhetoric and composition” for the "advancement of feminist research".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cwshrc.org/about-us/our-mission/|title=Our Mission|website=Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric and Composition|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of teachers and scholars dedicated to promoting the [[intersectionality]] of communication and collaboration within feminist rhetoric and research methods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Founding members included Winifred Horner, Jan Swearingen, Nan Johnson, Marjone Curry Woods, and Kathleen Welch.&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Ratcliffe |first= Krista |chapter=The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries |title=Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric: A Twenty-First Century Guide|editor1=Lynée Lewis Gaillet |editor2=Winifred Bryan Horner |publisher=University of Missouri Press|date=2010 |pages=185–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues with [[Andrea Lunsford]], Jackie Royster, [[Cheryl Glenn (academic)|Cheryl Glenn]], Shirley Logan, and other contemporary feminist writing scholars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 1996 brought the publication of ''Peitho'', the coalition’s newspaper, published by [[Susan Jarratt]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In present day feminist rhetoric, a point of emphasis is changing research methods and methodologies to include the discourse of marginalized groups.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Feminist rhetoric works to expand the rhetorical canon. The rhetorical canon is traditionally composed of five parts: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Canons/Canons.htm|title=the canons of rhetoric|website=rhetoric.byu.edu|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced by the Roman orator [[Cicero]] in his treatise ''De Inventione'' around 50 BC. The idea was expanded by the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] 150 years later in ''Institutio Oratoria.'' The rhetorical canon has been used in rhetorical education since its creation. Rhetorical treatises have based their purpose off these canons. Rhetoric is integrated in the education system, which means that students are taught the rhetorical canon as well. Feminist rhetoric scholars argue that this canon, and its methods of persuasion or argument, exclude some valuable forms of public discourse and narrative, and seek to expand it accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Methodology in rhetoric studies ===
Scholars, such as Jessica Enoch and Jaqueline Jones Royster, introduced the idea of changing the way research is recognized and constructed. Scholars in rhetoric studies agree there is a plethora of voices and demographics to draw upon for data necessary for research in the field.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enoch|first=Jessica|date=2004|title="Para La Mujer": Defining a Chicana Feminist Rhetoric at the Turn of the Century|url=|journal=College English|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers suggest this is achieved by asking questions that have never been asked before, recognizing the wealth of materials (or lack thereof) in archives, and expanding the idea of an archive.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In recent years, archives have been deconstructed, or critically analyzed, outside of scholarly articles. Feminist rhetorical academics work to develop research methods and methodologies by including new types of archival research such as- yearbooks, small town newspapers, and community contributing archival websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck|first=Amy|date=2017|title=Classbook Sense': Genre and Girls' School Yearbooks in the Early-Twenties- Century American High School|url=|journal=College English|volume=79.4|pages=358–383|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global narratives ===
Another main idea in feminist rhetoric is making the point of view, and the rhetorical canon, more expansive than what lies within the United States' domain of discourse.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: New Horizons for  Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies|last1=Royster|first1=Jacqueline Jones|last2=Kirsch|first2=Gesa E.|date=2012|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric scholars ask the questions of how rhetoric, writing studies, and social change intersect, or may be influenced by politics, the economy, religions, cultures, and education.&lt;ref name="Kirsh"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Gesa E.|last2=Royster|first2=Jacqueline J.|date=2010|title=Feminist Rhetorical Practices: In Search of Excellence|jstor=27917867|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=61|issue=4|pages=640–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key term used in this field is "[[transnationality]]", defined as the culture of one nation moving through borders to another nation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is used with the terms cultural hybridity and intertextuality, which continue the theory of cultures, texts, and ideas mixing with one another.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Feminist rhetoric works to represent the voices and discourse of genders that go beyond the binary of male and female. [[Transgender]] discourse is another main point of focus in feminist rhetoric, which is recognized by scholars as a lack of privilege some authors have.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rawson|first1=K.J.|last2=Ronald|first2=Kate|date=2010|title=Queering Feminist Rhetorical Canonization|journal=Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies|pages=39–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royster and others have called for research focused on how gender dynamics affect communication, including rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
[[Race and ethnicity]] is an area of focus for several scholars in feminist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have changed research methods to include international races and ethnicity outside the typical rhetoric canon.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric focuses on how archiving cultural rhetoric, such as that of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women, can create a better understanding of the pedagogy of research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webber|first=Jim|date=2008-10-14|title=A Review of: "Refiguring Rhetorical Education: Women Teaching African American, Native American, and Chicano/a Students, 1865–1911, by Jessica Enoch."|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=467–469|doi=10.1080/02773940802405546|issn=0277-3945}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue that has arisen in feminist rhetoric is the discourse of colored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some female scholars of color have written about their perceived need to mask their identity when sharing their voices and opinions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Sano-Franchini, Jennifer, Donnie Sackey and Stacey Pigg. “Methodological Dwellings: A Search for Feminisms in Rhetoric &amp; Composition.” Present Tense, Vol. 1, Issue 2. Michigan State Univ. Press. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist rhetoric theory works to legitimize the ethnic discourse of women and give it a platform in the academia of rhetoric and writing studies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Challenges ==
Feminist rhetoric scholars have noted the difficulty in including diverse voices in the rhetorical canon.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Scholars have argued that changes in research methods may be needed to better include the voices of those who are disabled, trans, and [[queer]] in rhetoric studies.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dolmage, Jay, et al. “Refiguring Rhetorica: Linking Feminist Rhetoric and Disability Studies.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 23–38. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite longstanding feminist opposition to processes of canonization as inherently imposing limits and excluding perspectives, feminist rhetoric has begun to develop its own canon of commonly referenced texts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accordingly, feminist rhetoric scholars try to include the works of unknown feminist rhetors in their theorization processes, and develop a gendered analysis or approach that actively includes rhetors who are traditionally excluded from rhetorical canons, such as women of color or low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Rhetors, along with expanding the feminist rhetorical canon, work to make feminist rhetoric applicable in pedagogy and education. Scholars discuss the importance of research, whether that be changing research methods or looking further into textual research.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some suggest this can be done by theorizing, others want to employ critical imagination.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Addison, Joanne, and Kate Ronald. “Researching Literacy as a Lived Experience.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 136–151. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Theory as a research method approaches discourse from different communities as a generalized idea that allows people to participate in the world through rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric sees theory in this sense as a form for people to speak out and be included in the rhetorical canon. Critical imagination is using the silence, or lack of work from feminist rhetors, to extrapolate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Scholars discuss how this involves understanding that there is more to not only feminist rhetoric, but feminist practice in theory, than what is written down in textbooks or history. Scholars, such as Royster and Kirsch, acknowledge that feminist rhetoric needs to draw from the silence to help set a new precedent for rhetorical practices in the future.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A part of critical imagination is knowing that the documentation of rhetoric thus far isn’t the only important rhetoric that should contribute to pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Eves, Rosalyn. “Landmark Essays on Rhetoric and Feminism, 1973–2000 ed. by Cheryl Glenn and Andrea Lunsford (Review)” ''Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs'', Volume 19, Number 4. pp. 705-708. Michigan State Univ. Press. Winter 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
A goal of feminist rhetoric is to be viewed as a rhetorical theory of writing as opposed to a social theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Micciche, Laura R., and Kate Ronald. “Writing as Feminist Rhetorical Theory.” ''Rhetorica in Motion: Feminist Rhetorical Methods and Methodologies'', edited by Eileen E. Schell and K. J. Rawson, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pa, 2010, pp. 173–188. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkff8.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Feminist rhetoric seeks to influence the pedagogy of writing in high school and other levels of academia.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Scholars in the field of feminist rhetoric seek to open academic discourse and pedagogy of rhetoric to all types of people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9490">[[File:Schreiben mit Kugelschreiber.jpg|thumb|Student writing takes many shapes in Freshman writing classes, including handwritten freewriting and notetaking.]]    

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic writing===

First described by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Mina Shaughnessy]] in the 1970s, [[Basic writing]] is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk.

'''For all practical purposes (FAPP)''' is a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach towards the problem of incompleteness of every [[science|scientific]] [[theory]] and the usage of [[Limit (mathematics)|asymptotical]] [[approximation]]s.

When a [[physicist]] makes an approximation - which can not be justified on rigorous grounds - he or she may attempt to justify it by saying the results obtained are good for all practical purposes (FAPP). Meaning they agree with our experience and [[approximation error]]s cannot be detected in practical [[measurement]]s (for instance, if the error is smaller than the measurement resolution).

FAPP theories are incomplete or lackly-based theories that nevertheless have very high agreement with experiments and tend to be very useful for all practical purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">The '''Futures of American Studies''' is a weeklong academic summer institute dedicated to presenting new work and critiquing the field of [[American Studies]] held at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The first Futures of American Studies Institute was held in the summer of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;The Futures of American Studies. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald E. Pease]], Professor of English at Dartmouth College, founded, organizes, and directs the annual Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Futures of American Studies,'' Edited by Donald E. Pease, Robyn Wiegman, Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2957-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of the Institute==
After the [[School of Criticism and Theory]] left Dartmouth for [[Cornell University]] in 1995, Dartmouth faculty member Donald E. Pease started the Futures Institute as an alternative summer program for faculty and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Futures Institute celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its founding.

==Institute Description==
The Institute is divided into two daily plenary sessions, which feature current work from Institute faculty, and multiple three-hour research seminars in which all participants present and discuss their own work-in-progress. Speakers in the plenary sessions typically examine the relation between emergent and residual practices in the field of American Studies from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Participants come from a variety of programs and schools and represent fields as diverse as American history, social geography, American literature, gender studies, and the digital humanities. The Institute welcomes participants who are involved in a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and who are interested in current critical debates in American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~futures/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game studies''', or '''ludology''', is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a discipline of [[cultural studies]] that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychology]], while examining aspects of the [[Game design|design of the game]], the players in the game, and finally, the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of [[video games]], but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including [[sport]]s, [[board game]]s, etc.

Before video games, game studies often only included anthropological work, studying the games of past societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Ludens|last=Huizinga|first=Johan|publisher=Tjeenk Willink &amp; zoon|year=1938|isbn=|location=Haarlem|pages=|oclc=962401170}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once video games were introduced and became mainstream, game studies were updated to perform sociological and psychological observations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designtoolbox.co.uk/strategies/three-genres-of-game-research/ |title=Three Genres of Game Research |last=Mayer |first=Richard  |date=29 May 2016 |website=Design ToolBox |access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to observe the effects of gaming on an individual, his or her interactions with society, and the way it could impact the world around us.

There are three main approaches to game studies: the '''[[social science]]''' approach asks itself how games affect people and uses tools such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. The '''[[humanities]]''' approach asks itself what meanings are expressed through games, and uses tools such as ethnography and patient observation. The '''industrial and engineering''' approach applies mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examines things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2007|editor-last=Williams|editor-first=J.

==History==

It wasn’t until [[Irving Finkel]] organized a colloquium in 1990 that grew into the [[International Board Game Studies Association]], [[Gonzalo Frasca]] popularized the term ''ludology'' (from the Latin word for game, ludus) in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frasca|first=Gonzalo|date=1999|title=Ludology Meets Narratology: Similitude and Differences between (video)games and Narrative|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|journal=[[Parnasso]]|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publication of the first issues of academic journals like ''Board Game Studies'' in 1998 and ''Game Studies'' in 2001, and the creation of the [[Digital Games Research Association]] in 2003, that scholars began to get the sense that the study of games could (and should) be considered a field in its own right. As a young field, it gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games, such as psychology, anthropology, economy, education, and sociology. The earliest known use of the term "ludology" occurred in 1982, in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s “Does Being Human Matter – On Some Interpretive Problems of Comparative Ludology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2004/02/22/the-definitive-history-of-games-and-stories-ludology-and-narratology/|title=The definitive history of games and stories, ludology and narratology|last=Juul|first=Jesper|date=2004-02-22|work=The Ludologist|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science==

One of the earliest social science theories (1971) about the role of video games in society involved [[violence]] in video games, later becoming known as the catharsis theory. The theory suggests that playing video games in which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression, resulting in less aggression in the players real lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Television and Aggression; an Experimental Field Study|last=Feshbach|first=Seymour|last2=Singer|first2=Robert D.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1971|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=|oclc=941871879}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-study]] performed by Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman, in 2001, examined data starting from the 1980s up until the article was published.  The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=C. A.|last2=Bushman|first2=B. J.|date=|year=2001|title=Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-9280.00366|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=5|pages=353–59|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that exposure to violence in video games did indeed cause an increase in aggression. However, it has been pointed out, and even stressed, by psychologist Jonathan Freedman that this research was very limited and even problematic since overly strong claims were made and the authors themselves seemed extremely biased in their writings. More recent studies, such as the one performed by Christopher J. Ferguson at [[Texas A&amp;M International University]] have come to drastically different conclusions. In this study, individuals were either randomly assigned a game, or allowed to choose a game, in both the randomized and the choice conditions exposure to violent video games caused no difference in aggression. A later study (performed by the same people) looked for correlations between trait aggression, violent crimes, and exposure to both real life violence and violence in video games, this study suggests that while family violence and trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime, exposure to video game violence was not a good predictor of violent crime, having little to no correlation, unless also paired with the above traits that had a much higher correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Rueda|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Cruz|first3=Amanda M.|last4=Ferguson|first4=Diana E.|last5=Fritz|first5=Stacey|last6=Smith|first6=Shawn M.|displayauthors=1|date=|year=2008|title=Violent Video Games and Aggression: Causal Relationship or Byproduct of Family Violence and Intrinsic Violence Motivation?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854807311719|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=35|issue=3|pages=311–32|doi=10.1177/0093854807311719|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 15 years, a large number of [[Meta-analysis|meta-studies]] have been applied to this issue, each coming to its own conclusion, resulting in little consensus in the ludology community. It is also thought that even nonviolent video games may lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. Anderson and Dill seem to believe that it may be due to the frustration of playing video games that could in turn result in violent, aggressive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.A.|last2=Dill|first2=K.E.|date=2000|title=Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviour in the laboratory and in life|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=772–790|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game designers [[Amy Jo Kim]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have suggested that platforms which leverage the powerful qualities of video games in non-game contexts can maximize learning.&lt;ref name="AmyJo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/smart-gamification|title=Smart Gamification|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|date=1 August 2011|website=SlideShare|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world|last=McGonigal|first=Jane|publisher=Penguin|year=2011|isbn=9780099540281|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[gamification of learning]], using game elements in non-game contexts extracts the properties of games from within the game context, and applies them to a learning context such as the classroom.

Another positive aspect of video games is its conducive character towards the involvement of a person in other cultural activities. The probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borowiecki|first=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A Substitute for Cultural Consumptions?|url=http://www.culturaleconomics.org/awp/AWP-07-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–58.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms of cultural consumption, inhibit thus value from a cultural perspective.

More sociologically-informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Video Gamers|last=Crawford|first=Garry|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415563680|location=London|pages=|author-link=Garry Crawford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it has been suggested{{By whom|date=March 2018}} that the very popular MMO ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' could be used to study the dissemination of infectious diseases because of the [[Corrupted Blood|accidental spread]] of a [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-like disease in the gameworld.

=="Ludology" vs "Narratology"==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

A major focus in game studies is the debate surrounding [[narratology]] and ludology. Many ludologists believe that the two are unable to exist together,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesperjuul.net/thesis/|title=A clash between game and narrative|website=www.jesperjuul.net|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that the two fields are similar but should be studied separately. Many narratologists believe that games should be looked at for their stories, like movies or novels. The ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due to the fact that a player is actively taking part in the experience and should therefore be understood on their own terms. The idea that a videogame is "radically different to narratives as a [[cognitive]] and [[Communication|communicative]] structure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aarseth|first1=Espen|date=|year=2001|title=Computer Game Studies, Year One|url=http://gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html|journal=Game Studies|volume=1|issue=1|page=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led the development of new approaches to criticism that are focused on videogames as well as adapting, repurposing and proposing new ways of studying and theorizing about videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2002|title=Computer Game Criticism: A Method for Computer Game Analysis|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.32231.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=89–100|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costikyan|first=Greg|date=2002|title=I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design: Toward a Critical Vocabulary for Games|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.51146.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=9–34|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent approach towards game studies{{Which|date=March 2018}} starts with an analysis of interface structures and challenges the keyboard-mouse paradigm with what is called a "[[ludic interface]]".

Academics across both fields provide scholarly insight into the different sides of this debate. Gonzalo Frasca, a notable ludologist due to his many publications regarding game studies, argues that while games share many similar elements with narrative stories, that should not prevent games to be studied as games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|title=Ludology|website=www.ludology.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seeks not "to replace the narratologic approach, but to complement it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Jesper Juul (game researcher)|Jesper Juul]], another notable ludologist, argues for a stricter separation of ludology and narratology. Juul argues that games "for all practicality ''can not'' tell stories."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This argument holds that narratology and ludology cannot exist together because they are inherently different. Juul claims that the most significant difference between the two is that in a narrative, events "have to" follow each other, whereas in a game the player has control over what happens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Garry Crawford]] and Victoria K. Gosling argue in favor of narratives being an essential part of games as "it is impossible to isolate play from the social influences of everyday life, and in turn, play will have both intended and unintended consequences for the individual and society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Garry|last2=Gosling|first2=Victoria K.|date=2009|title=More than a game: sports-themed video games and player narratives|url=|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|volume=26|pages=50–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Last of Us]]'' is a video game released in 2013 that has been referred to as a narrative "masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/why-last-us-first-truly-mature-action-game-story/|title=Why The Last of Us is the first truly mature action game (and our Game of the Year)|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the narratology side of game studies argue that ''The Last of Us'' and similar games that have followed it and preceded it, serve as examples that games can in fact tell stories.

==Other areas of research==

As is common with most academic disciplines, there are a number of more specialized areas or sub-domains of study.

===Video game pre-history===
An emerging field of study looks at the "pre-history" of video games, suggesting that the origins of modern digital games lie in: [[fair]]ground attractions and [[sideshow]]s such as shooting games; early "[[Coney Island]]"-style pleasure parks with elements such as large [[roller-coaster]]s and "[[haunted house]]" simulations; nineteenth century landscape simulations such as [[diorama]]s, [[panorama]]s, [[planetarium]]s, and [[stereograph]]s; and [[amusement arcade]]s that had mechanical game machines and also [[peep-show]] film machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Art|last=Grau|first=Oliver|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-262-57223-1|location=|pages=|author-link=Oliver Grau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games and aging===
In light of [[population ageing]], there has been an interest into the use of games to improve the overall health and social connectedness of ageing players. For example, [[Adam Gazzaley]] and his team have designed [[NeuroRacer]] (a game that improves cognitive tasks outside of the game among its 60+ year old participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|title=NeuroRacer Study|author=Gazzaley|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Gazzaley|date=4 September 2013|website=|publisher=Gazzaley Lab|location=[[University of California, San Francisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908124030/http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|archive-date=8 September 2013|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while the [[AARP]] has organized a [[game jam]] to improve older people's social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miamioh.edu/news/campus-news/2016/03/aarp-game-jam.html|title=AARP teams up with students designing games for 50 plus|last=Kissell|first=Margo|date=17 March 2016|website=Miami University|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as Sarah Mosberg Iversen have argued that most of the academic work on games and ageing has been informed by notions of economical productivity,{{Sfn|Iversen|2014|p=}} while [[Bob De Schutter]] and Vero Vanden Abeele have suggested a game design approach that is not focused on age-related decline but instead is rooted in the positive aspects of older age.{{Sfn|De Schutter|Vanden Abeele|2015|p=}}

===Virtual economies in gaming===
{{main|Virtual economy}}

Massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about the real world. Markets based on digital information can be fully tracked as they are used by players, and thus real problems in the economy, such as inflation, deflation and even recession. The solutions the game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information, and experiments can be performed where the economy can be studied as a whole. These games allow the economists to be omniscient, they can find every piece of information they need to study the economy, while in the real world they have to work with presumptions.

Former Finance Minister of Greece and Valve's in-house economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] studied ''[[EVE Online]]'' and argued that video game communities give economists a venue for experimenting and simulating the economies of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/09/28/the-economics-of-video-games/|title=The Economics of Video Games|last=Plumer|first=Brad|date=28 September 2012|website=The Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/07/a-multiplayer-game-environment|title='A Multiplayer Game Environment Is Actually a Dream Come True for an Economist'|last=Suderman|first=Peter|date=June 2014|website=Reason|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Castronova has studied virtual economies within a variety of games including Everquest and World of Warcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castronova|first=Edward|date=July 2002|title=On Virtual Economies|ssrn=338500|journal=CESifo Working Paper Series|language=|volume=752|pages=|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Synthetic worlds: the business and culture of online games|last=Edward.|first=Castronova,|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226096278|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=58648183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Benefits ===
The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201502/cognitive-benefits-playing-video-games|title=Cognitive Benefits of Playing Video Games|last=Gray|first=Peter|date=20 February 2015|website=Psychology Today|language=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user’s constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened.

The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved thanks in part to video games, due to the need to operate the controller and view the screen displaying the content all at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The coordination of the player is enhanced due the playing and continuous observation of a video game since the game gives high mental stimulation and coordination is important and therefore enhanced due to the constant visual and physical movement that is produced from the playing of the video game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The playing of video games can also help increase a player's social skills. This is done by playing online multiplayer games which can require constant communication, this leads to socialization between players in order to achieve the goal within the game they may be playing. In addition it can help the users to meet new friends over their online games and at the same time communicate with friends they have already made in the past; those playing together online would only strengthen their already established bond through constant cooperation. Some video games are specifically designed to aid in learning, because of this another benefit of playing video games could be the educational value provided with the entertainment. Some video games present problem solving questions that the player must think on in order to properly solve, while action orientated video games require strategy in order to successfully complete. This process of being forced to think critically helps to sharpen the mind of the player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=2014|title=The Benefits of Playing Video Games|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|journal=American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game Culture'''

One aspect of game studies is the study of gaming culture. People who play video games are a subculture of their own. Gamers will often form communities with their own languages, attend conventions where they will dress up as their favorite characters, and have gaming competitions.  One of these conventions, Gamescon 2017, had a record attendance with over 350,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/gamescom-2017-worlds-biggest-video-game-convention-has-biggest-year-ever|title=Gamescom 2017: World's Biggest Video Game Convention Has Biggest Year Ever|last=Stewart|first=Sam|date=28 August 2017|website=IGN|language=|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demographics of Gamers''' 
* 65% of households have a gamer.
* 67% own a console or gaming device.  
* 33 is the average age of male gamers. 
* 37 is the average age of female gamers. 
* 59% of gamers are men. 41% are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/!EF2017_Design_FinalDigital.pdf|title=2017 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|last=|first=|date=April 2017|website=Entertainment Software Association|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==
{{main|Gender differences in humans}}
Natural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include [[chromosome]]s and [[hormone|hormonal]] differences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wood, Julia. Gendered Lives. 6th. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

From birth males and females are raised differently and experience different environments throughout their lives.

The colour blue is most commonly associated with boys and they get toys like monster trucks or more sport related things to play with from the time that they are babies. Girls are more commonly introduced to the colour pink, dolls, dresses, and playing house where they are taking care of the dolls as if they were children. The norm of blue is for boys and pink is for girls is cultural and has not always historically been around. These paths set by parents or other adult figures in the child's life set them on certain paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordier|first=B|year=2012|title=Gender, betwixt biology and society|url=|journal=European Journal of Sexology and Sexual Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a difference in personality, career paths, or relationships.

{{Main|Gender pay gap}} 
The gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Using education to reduce the wage gap between men and women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000370|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.04.006|issn=1053-5357|last1=Miki|first1=Malul|last2=Yuval|first2=Fany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|website=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

[[Human capital]] theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman. The American People Census 2000: Gender Inequality at Work. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer preference studies===
A 2010 study conducted by [[David R.

=== Gender roles in parenting and marriage ===
Gender roles are heavily influenced by biology, with male-female play styles correlating with sex hormones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Golombok|first2=Susan|last3=Rust|first3=John|last4=Johnston|first4=Katie J.|last5=Golding|first5=Jean|last6=Team|first6=The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Study|title=Testosterone during Pregnancy and Gender Role Behavior of Preschool Children: A Longitudinal, Population Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 January 2002|volume=73|issue=6|pages=1678–1687|jstor=3696409|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00498}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual orientation, aggressive traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaer|first1=Marcia L.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|title=Human behavioral sex differences: A role for gonadal hormones during early development?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 July 1995|volume=118|issue=1|pages=55–107|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.118.1.55|pmid=7644606|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/118/1/55/|language=English|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craft|first1=Rebecca M.|last2=Mogil|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Aloisi|first3=Anna Maria|title=Sex differences in pain and analgesia: the role of gonadal hormones|journal=European Journal of Pain|date=1 October 2004|volume=8|issue=5|pages=397–411|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.01.003|pmid=15324772|language=en|issn=1532-2149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] demonstrate increased masculinity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Brook|first2=Charles|last3=Conway|first3=Gerard S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|jstor=3813405|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been shown that rhesus macaque children exhibit preferences for stereotypically male and female toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes - Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes.emory.edu |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children." (703).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

== In the criminal justice system ==
{{See also|Sex differences in crime}}
Sonja B. Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case.

== In television and film ==
The [[New York Film Academy]] took a closer look at the women in Hollywood and gathered statistics from the top 500 films from 2007 to 2012, for their history and achievements, or lack of.

There was a 5:1 ratio of men to women working in films. 30.8% of women having speaking characters, who may or may not have been a part of the 28.8% of women who were written to wear revealing clothing compared to the 7% of men who did, or the 26.2% of women who wore little to no clothing opposed to the 9.4% of men who did the same.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Inequality in Film|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/gender-inequality-in-film/|website=New York Film Academy Blog|accessdate=10/4/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study analyzing five years of text from over 2,000 news sources found a similar 5:1 ratio of male to female names overall, and 3:1 for names in entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shor | first1=E. | last2=van de Rijt | first2=A. | last3 = Miltsov | first3 = A. | last4 = Kulkarni | first4 = Vivek | last5 = Skiena | first5 = S. | year=2015 |title=A Paper Ceiling: Explaining the Persistent Underrepresentation of Women in Printed News | url=https://www.mcgill.ca/sociology/files/sociology/2015_-_asr.pdf |journal = American Sociological Review |volume=80 |issue=5|pages=960–984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood actresses are paid less than actors.

In the 2013 [[Academy Awards]], 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated. No woman was nominated for directing, cinematography, film editing, writing (original screenplay), or original score that year. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. [[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place... After all, the vast majority of sexual harassment, abuse and violence is perpetrated by men, whether in Hollywood or not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-arquette-david-schwimmer-join-hollywood- men-activists-launch-askmoreofhim-campaign-1090121|title=David Schwimmer Join Hollywood Men and Activists to Launch #AskMoreOfHim Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accountability is set to change the way women are seen and treated in the film and television industry, hopefully ending in the closing of the gap women are experiencing in pay, promotion, and overall respect.

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results Gender and the MDGs: A gender lens is vital for pro-poor results]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society. Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]]. In a carefully controlled study,&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|date=November–December 2011|title=Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries? A typical case of lies, damned lies, and statistics|journal=[[Women's Studies International Forum]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2011.07.001|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://martinhilbert.net/DigitalGenderDivide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that women embrace digital technology more than men.  Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

{{Main|Global Gender Gap Report}}
Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Kevin|title=The Missing Girls from China|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Fall 2014 – Winter 2015|volume=36|issue=2|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu/zalaquett/mcdp/Asian%20handout.htm|title=Characteristics of  the Traditional Asian Family|website=www.coedu.usf.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also the main victims of  poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt;

In Cambodia, the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) was formed in 1998 with the role of improving women's overall power and status in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0).&lt;ref name="Global Gender Gap Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Gender Gap Report 2013|url=http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331190253/http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.

The labor force participation rate of women was 80.7% in 2013.&lt;ref name=undp&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report for 2012|url=https://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-4-Gender-Inequality-Index/pq34-nwq7|publisher=United Nations Development Project|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Lockwood of the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, in a 2009 report wrote that female labor participation is lower than men, but has been rapidly increasing since the 1990s. Out of India's 397 million workers in 2001, 124 million were women, states Lockwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is on target to meet its [[Millennium Development Goal]] of gender parity in education before 2016.&lt;ref name="in.one.un.org"&gt;http://in.one.un.org/task-teams/gender-equality-and-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  UNICEF's measures of attendance rate and Gender Equality in Education Index (GEEI) attempt to capture the quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalther, E.

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

'''Health communication''' is the study and practice of communicating [[Health promotion|promotional health information]], such as in [[public health]] campaigns, [[health education]], and between doctor and patient.&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Communication? |url=http://www.natcom.org/Tertiary.aspx?id=236&amp;terms=health%20communication |publisher=[[National Communication Association]] |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of disseminating health information is to influence personal health choices by improving [[health literacy]].

Because effective health communication must be tailored for the audience and the situation,&lt;ref name=EHS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beato |first=Ricardo R. |author2=Jana Telfer |title=Communication as an Essential Component of Environmental Health Science |journal=Journal of Environmental Health |date=July–August 2010 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/JEH/2010/July-Aug_Beato_Telfer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into health communication seeks to refine communication strategies to inform people about ways to enhance health or to avoid specific health risks.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Health Communication Basics|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/healthbasics/whatishc.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, health communication is a discipline within [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"/&gt;

Health communication may variously seek to:
* increase audience knowledge and awareness of a health issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyn|first1=Richard|title=Communicating health and illness|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=0761964754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* demonstrate healthy practices
* demonstrate the benefits of behavior changes to [[public health]] outcomes
* advocate a position on a health issue or policy
* increase demand or support for health services
* argue against misconceptions about health&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freimuth|first=Vicki S.|author2=Sandra Crouse Quinn|title=The Contributions of Health Communication to Eliminating Health Disparities|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2004|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2053–2055|doi=10.2105/ajph.94.12.2053|pmc=1448587}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The term was generated when members of an ICA, [[International Communication Association]], interest group adopted the term. Interdisciplinary marriage between health and communication was certainly a common-law relationship long before the term "health communication" was introduced. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)
The research of health communication surrounds the development of effective messages about health, the dissemination of health-related information through broadcast, print, and electronic media, and the role of inter personal relationships in health communities. At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)

==Research==
There are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 495) Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes. According to Stacks and Salween on page 496 some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.
Over the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 497)
Impact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.

When assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Stacks &amp; Salween page 498)

The efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.

==Training==
Health communication professionals are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N. Hyde|title=An Alumni-Based Evaluation of Graduate Training in Health Communication: Results of a Survey on Careers, Salaries, Competencies, and Emerging Trends|journal=Journal of Health Communication|date=November 2004|pages=5–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for Health Communication maintains a list of such programs.&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Programs in Health Communication|url=http://www.healthcommunication.net/CHC/gradprograms/grad%20programs.htm|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and practitioners in health communication are often trained in disciplines such as [[communication studies]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], or [[medicine]] and then focus within their field on either health or communication. Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt; Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.

==Overview==
[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

Careers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

Clear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=HTB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul–Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.

The social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor’s offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

=== Critical Health Communication ===
Critical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates "how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines links with culture, resources, and other social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from mainstream Health Communication in its emphasis on qualitative and interpretive methods, and its attention to the ideological processes that underpin shared understandings of health. Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89–135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.

==Strategies and methods==
Tailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N. Benac |author3=Melissa S. Harris|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=4|pages=673–693|pmid=17592961|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.4.673|title=Does tailoring matter? Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.

Communication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient’s communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.

Communicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Campaigns===
Health Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).&lt;ref name="HTB"/&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;
* By catering to the common denominator within the audience
* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message
* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments
Both the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;
* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem
* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome
* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers
* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences
* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message
* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message
* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made

====Historical campaigns====

=====American smallpox epidemic=====
In 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardiovascular disease=====
Three-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three "communities" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].

===Communication channels===

====Entertainment media====
Using the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive "tip sheets" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]]&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757913915619120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/1/169/3089818&lt;/ref&gt;.

Writers and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.

====Direct marketing====
{{Main|Social marketing}}
[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]
Media advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.

====Interpersonal communication====
Health communication relies on strong interpersonal communications in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard.

==Applications==
Health communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.

Another increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in "good, very good, or excellent health", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427–435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.

==Challenges==
There are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.

===Literacy-communication gap===
{{Further|Health literacy}}

One problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187–227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity. Specifically, studies have been done amongst elderly populations in America to illustrate a common audience who is left at a disadvantage due to this issue.&lt;ref name=LCG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hester|first=Eva Jackson|title=An Investigation of the Relationship Between Health Literacy and Social Communication Skills in Older Adults|journal=Communication Disorders Quarterly|date=February 2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=112–119|doi=10.1177/1525740108324040}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older adults comprise an age group that generally suffers from the most chronic health conditions in comparison to other age groups, however studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} that even this group have difficulty understanding written health materials, understanding health care and policies, and generally do not comprehend medical jargon. Such shortcomings of health communication may lead to increased hospitalizations, the inability to respond to and manage a disease or medical condition, and a generally declining health status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In some populations, health-related websites (e.g., [[WebMD]]) and online support groups (e.g., Association for Cancer Online Resources) have increased access to health information.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Mass media===
Mass communication is used to promote beneficial changes in behavior among members of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abroms|first=LC|author2=Maibach, EW|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=219–34|pmid=18173391|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824|title=The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major criticism of the use of mass media as a method of health communication is the unfortunate ability for false and misinformed messages to spread quickly through the mass media, before they have the chance to be disputed by professionals. This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine. Although this panic has been ferociously labeled as fictitious, many still harbor a lingering suspicion towards vaccinations and refuse them, which has caused an immediate [[public health]] concern.

'''Historical particularism''' (coined by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968)&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin: ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture''. 1968.  (Reissued 2001) New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company&lt;/ref&gt; is widely considered the first American [[anthropological]] school of thought.

Closely associated with [[Franz Boas]] and the [[Boasian anthropology|Boasian approach to anthropology]], historical particularism rejected the [[Classical social evolutionism|cultural evolutionary model]] that had dominated anthropology until Boas. It argued that each society is a collective representation of its unique historical past. Boas rejected parallel evolutionism, the idea that all societies are on the same path and have reached their specific level of development the same way all other societies have.&lt;ref name="methods"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boas |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Boas |title=The Methods of Ethnology |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=311–321 |date=December 1920 |format=[[jstor]] [[PDF]] |doi=10.1525/aa.1920.22.4.02a00020
  | jstor=660328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, historical particularism showed that societies could reach the same level of [[cultural development]] through different paths.&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;

Boas suggested that diffusion, trade, corresponding environment, and historical accident may create similar cultural traits.&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;  Three traits, as suggested by Boas, are used to explain cultural customs: environmental conditions, psychological factors, and historical connections, history being the most important (hence the school's name).&lt;ref name="methods"/&gt;

Critics of historical particularism argue that it is [[Antipositivist|anti theoretical]] because it doesn't seek to make universal theories, applicable to all the world's cultures.  Boas believed that theories would arise spontaneously once enough data was collected.  This school of anthropological thought was the first to be uniquely American and Boas (his school of thought included) was, arguably, the most influential anthropological thinker in American history.

'''''Human Traces''''' is a 2005 [[novel]] by [[Sebastian Faulks]], best known as the British author of ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]''. The novel took Faulks five years to write. It tells of two friends who set up a pioneering asylum in 19th-century Austria, in tandem with the evolution of psychiatry and the start of the [[First World War]].

==Plot overview==
Tracing the intertwined lives of Doctors Thomas Midwinter, who is English, and Jacques Rebière, from [[Brittany]], France, ''Human Traces'' explores the development of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in the late 19th century, by way of excursions into first [[psychiatry|alienism]] then [[metaphysics]], [[human evolution]] and [[neuroscience]], before the search for what it means to be human takes us into a brief foray into the [[First World War]]. Central to the plot is the theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

Whilst some have criticised ''Human Traces'' as excessively [[expository]], detailed and [[didactic]], it has also been considered wide-ranging, ambitious and well written. It has enjoyed commercial success, having been a bestseller in the United Kingdom.

Faulks himself says of his novel:

'Human Traces was a [[Sisyphus|Sisyphean task]]. After spending five years in libraries reading up on madness, psychiatry and psychoanalysis (my office had charts and timelines and things plastered all over the walls), the act of finishing it felt like a bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21613136-5001986,00.html ''The Australian'', Books, 28 April 2007 'Parting with the art of war]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human evolution''' is the [[evolution]]ary process that led to the emergence of [[anatomically modern humans]], beginning with the [[Primate evolution|evolutionary history]] of [[primate]]s – in particular [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]'' – and leading to the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a distinct species of the [[Hominid|hominid family]], the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as  [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|human bipedalism]] and [[language]],&lt;ref name="HallHallgrímsson2011c"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian K.

The study of human evolution involves several scientific disciplines, including [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], [[primatology]], [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[neurobiology]], [[ethology]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[embryology]] and [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heng |first=Henry H.

Within the [[Hominoidea]] (apes) superfamily, the [[Hominidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] diverged from the [[Gibbon|Hylobatidae]] (gibbon) family some 15–20 million years ago; African great apes (subfamily [[Homininae]]) diverged from [[orangutan]]s ([[Ponginae]]) about {{Mya|14}}; the [[Hominini]] tribe (humans, ''Australopithecines'' and other extinct biped genera, and [[chimpanzee]]) parted from the [[Gorillini]] tribe (gorillas) between 8-9 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes [[Hominina]] (humans and biped ancestors) and [[Panina]] (chimps) separated 4-7.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Max Planck 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|2012}}

==Anatomical changes==
[[File:Ape skeletons.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Ape|hominoids]] are descendants of a [[common descent|common ancestor]]]]
Human evolution from its first separation from the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees]] is characterized by a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[human development (biology)|developmental]], [[human physiology|physiological]], and [[Human behavior|behavioral]] changes.
The most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened [[ontogeny]] (gestation and infancy), and decreased [[sexual dimorphism]]. The relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|Silk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]], a change first occurring in ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brues|Snow|1965|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9WemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1–39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipedalism===
[[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''&lt;ref name="Brunet2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |authorlink3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=H. |last5=Likius |first5=A. |last6=Ahounta |first6=D. |last7=Beauvilain |first7=A. |last8=Blondel |first8=C. |last9=Bocherens |first9=H. |last10=Boisserie |first10=J. |last11=De Bonis |first11=L. |last12=Coppens |first12=Y. |last13=Dejax |first13=J. |last14=Denys |first14=C. |last15=Duringer |first15=P. |last16=Eisenmann |first16=V. |last17=Fanone |first17=G. |last18=Fronty |first18=P. |last19=Geraads |first19=D. |last20=Lehmann |first20=T. |last21=Lihoreau |first21=F. |last22=Louchart |first22=A. |last23=Mahamat |first23=A. |last24=Merceron |first24=G. |last25=Mouchelin |first25=G. |last26=Otero |first26=O. |last27=Pelaez Campomanes |first27=P. |last28=Ponce De Leon |first28=M. |last29=Rage |first29=J. |last30=Sapanet |first30=M. |last31=Schuster |first31=M. |last32=Sudre |first32=J. |last33=Tassy |first33=P. |last34=Valentin |first34=X. |last35=Vignaud |first35=P. |last36=Viriot |first36=L. |last37=Zazzo |first37=A. |last38=Zollikofer |first38=C. |display-authors=3 |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12110880}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Orrorin]]'', both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorilla and chimpanzee, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time, so either of ''Sahelanthropus'' or ''Orrorin'' may be our [[Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor|last shared ancestor]]. ''[[Ardipithecus]]'', a full biped, arose somewhat later. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus ''Homo''. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion,&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwang Hyun|first=Ko|date=2015|title=Origins of Bipedalism |journal=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology|doi=10.1590/S1516-89132015060399|pmid=|access-date=|volume=58|issue=6|pages=929–934}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled long distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest habitat.&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth" /&gt; A new study provides support for the hypothesis that walking on two legs, or bipedalism, evolved because it used less energy than quadrupedal knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 17, 2007 |title=Study Identifies Energy Efficiency As Reason For Evolution Of Upright Walking |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070716191140.htm |work=[[Science Daily|ScienceDaily]] |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |accessdate=2015-04-09}}

Another change is the shape of the big toe.  Recent studies suggest that Australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe.  This was progressively lost in Habilines.

Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]], feet and ankles, and skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aiello|Dean|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[femur]] evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the [[lumbar vertebrae]] became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondo|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long downward facing [[ilium (bone)|iliac blade]] was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking;&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009" /&gt; bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. A drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strickberger|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=feMItLo5gwgC&amp;pg=PA476 475–476]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trevathan|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Potlqpl-jxgC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater [[neoteny]], compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age.&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008|pp=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Zuk, Marlene (2014), "Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us About Sex, Diet, and How We Live" (W. W. Norton &amp; Company)&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more frequent appearance of [[alloparenting]] in humans when compared with other hominids.&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer (2011), "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding" (Harvard Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of [[menopause]] with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass on their genes by taking care of their daughter's offspring, as compared to having more children of their own.&lt;ref name="Wayman_Sciencenews"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wayman |first=Erin |date=August 19, 2013 |title=Killer whales, grandmas and what men want: Evolutionary biologists consider menopause |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-grandmas-and-what-men-want-evolutionary-biologists-consider-menopause |journal=[[Science News]] |issn=0036-8423 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human species eventually developed a much larger brain than that of other primates—typically {{convert|1,330|cm3|abbr=on}} in modern humans, nearly three times the size of a chimpanzee or gorilla brain.&lt;ref name="Schoeneman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoenemann |first=P.

This evolution continued in ''Homo erectus'' with {{convert|800–1,100|cm3|abbr=on}}, and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with {{convert|1,200–1,900|cm3|abbr=on}}, larger even than modern ''Homo sapiens''. This brain increase manifested during postnatal [[neural development|brain growth]], far exceeding that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]).

The increase in volume of the [[neocortex]] also included a rapid increase in size of the [[cerebellum]]. Its function has traditionally been associated with balance and fine motor control, but more recently with [[speech]] and [[cognition]]. The great apes, including hominids, had a more pronounced cerebellum relative to the neocortex than other primates. It has been suggested that because of its function of sensory-motor control and learning complex muscular actions, the cerebellum may have underpinned human technological adaptations, including the preconditions of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=Robert A. |last2=Venditti |first2=Chris |date=October 20, 2014 |title=Rapid Evolution of the Cerebellum in Humans and Other Great Apes |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=2440–2444 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.056 |pmid=25283776 |issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Starowicz-Filip |first1=Anna |last2=Milczarek |first2=Olga |last3=Kwiatkowski |first3=Stanisław |last4=Bętkowska-Korpała |first4=Barbara |last5=Prochwicz |first5=Katarzyna |display-authors=3 |year=2013 |title=Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome CCAS – a case report |url=http://www.archivespp.pl/uploads/images/2013_15_3/StarowiczFilip57_ArchivesPP_3_2013.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy |volume=3 |pages=57–64 |oclc=220954272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Feng Yu |author2=Qing-jun Jiang |author3=Xi-yan Sun |author4=Rong-wei Zhang |display-authors=3 |date=August 22, 2014 |title=A new case of complete primary cerebellar agenesis: clinical and imaging findings in a living patient |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |doi=10.1093/brain/awu239 |issn=1460-2156 |pmid=25149410 |volume=138 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=e353 |pmc=4614135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Anne H. |date=March 8, 2005 |title=Reciprocal evolution of the cerebellum and neocortex in fossil humans |journal=Proc.

The immediate survival advantage of encephalization is difficult to discern, as the major brain changes from ''Homo erectus'' to ''Homo heidelbergensis'' were not accompanied by major changes in technology.

===Sexual dimorphism===
The reduced degree of [[sexual dimorphism in humans]] is visible primarily in the reduction of the male [[canine tooth]] relative to other ape species (except gibbons) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[Concealed ovulation|hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only hominoids in which the female is fertile year round and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as genital swelling or overt changes in proceptivity during estrus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Nancy Makepeace|author2=Tanner|title=On Becoming Human|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ|date=981|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28028-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 202]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 15% larger than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reno|first=Philip L.|last2=Lovejoy|first2=C.

===Ulnar opposition===
The ulnar opposition – the contact between the [[thumb]] and the tip of the [[little finger]] of the same hand – is unique to [[anatomically modern humans]].&lt;ref name="Miriam"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miriam Ittyerah| title =Hand Preference and Hand Ability: Evidence from studies in Haptic Cognition| publisher =John Benjamins Publishing| year =2013| pages =37–38| isbn =978-9027271648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wilson-hand.html |title=The Hand How Its Use Shapes the Brain, Language, and Human Culture|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=Pantheon Books| author=Frank R.

===Other changes===
A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans, among them an increased importance on vision rather than smell; a longer juvenile developmental period and higher infant dependency; a smaller gut; faster basal metabolism;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pontzer|first=Herman|date=2016|title=Metabolic acceleration and the evolution of human brain size and life history|url=|journal=Nature|volume=533|issue=7603|pages=390–392|via=|bibcode=2016Natur.533..390P|doi=10.1038/nature17654|pmid=27144364|pmc=4942851}}&lt;/ref&gt; loss of body hair; evolution of sweat glands; a change in the shape of the dental arcade from being u-shaped to being parabolic; development of a [[chin]] (found in ''Homo sapiens'' alone); development of [[Temporal styloid process|styloid process]]es; and the development of a [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]].

==History of study==
{{align|right|{{Human timeline}}}}{{align|right|{{Hominins}}}}
{{main|Archaic humans}}

===Before Darwin===
The word ''homo'', the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is [[Latin]] for "human". It was chosen originally by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his classification system. The word "human" is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. The Latin "homo" derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''dhghem'', or "earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage Dictionaries (editors)|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Anatomy|anatomical]] similarities.

===Darwin===
The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Darwin | first = Charles | year = 1859 | title = On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=  [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf Full image view] 1st | page = 488 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=506 | bibcode = 1872Natur...5..318B | volume = 5 | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/005318a0 | issue = 121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Man's Place in Nature|Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]], though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and [[sexual selection]] to humans when he published ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First fossils===
A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of [[Transitional fossil|fossil intermediaries]]. Neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856, three years before the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'', and Neanderthal fossils had been discovered in Gibraltar even earlier, but it was originally claimed that these were human remains of a creature suffering some kind of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montgomery|1988|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 1891 discovery by [[Eugène Dubois]] of what is now called ''Homo erectus'' at [[Trinil]], [[Java]], it was only in the 1920s when such fossils were discovered in Africa, that intermediate species began to accumulate.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1925, [[Raymond Dart]] described ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dart |first=Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Dart |date=February 7, 1925 |title=''Australopithecus africanus'': The Man-Ape of South Africa |journal=Nature |volume=115 |issue=2884 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1038/115195a0 |issn=0028-0836 |bibcode=1925Natur.115..195D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was the [[Taung Child]], an australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an [[endocast]] of the brain.

Although the brain was small (410&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and [[gorilla]]s, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short [[canine tooth|canine teeth]], and the position of the [[foramen magnum]] (the hole in the skull where the spine enters) was evidence of [[bipedal]] locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung Child was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

===The East African fossils—and ''Homo naledi'' in South Africa===
[[File:Fossil hominids.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States|U.S.]].]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in the regions of the [[Olduvai Gorge]] and [[Lake Turkana]]. The driving force of these searches was the Leakey family, with [[Louis Leakey]] and his wife [[Mary Leakey]], and later their son [[Richard Leakey|Richard]] and daughter-in-law [[Meave Leakey|Meave]]—all  successful and world-renowned fossil hunters and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]]s. From the fossil beds of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins: the [[australopithecines]] and ''Homo'' species, and even ''Homo erectus''.

These finds cemented Africa as the cradle of humankind. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, [[Ethiopia]] emerged as the new hot spot of [[paleoanthropology]] after [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|"Lucy"]], the most complete fossil member of the species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', was found in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]] near [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]] in the desertic [[Afar Triangle]] region of northern Ethiopia. Although the specimen had a small brain, the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans, showing with certainty that these hominins had walked erect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=20–22, 184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy was classified as a new species, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', which is thought to be more closely related to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' as a direct ancestor, or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known hominid or hominin from this early time range; ''see'' [[Hominidae|terms "hominid" and "hominin"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Human Lineage | author=Cartmill, Matt |author2=Fred H.

===The genetic revolution===
[[File:Louis Leakey.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Louis Leakey]] examining skulls from [[Olduvai Gorge]], [[Tanzania]]]]
The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when [[Vincent Sarich]] and [[Allan Wilson]] measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of [[Serum (blood)|blood serum]] [[albumin]] between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas).&lt;ref name="MolClock"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance, which was in turn proportional to the number of [[amino acid]] differences between homologous proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.

In their seminal 1967 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,&lt;ref name=MolClock/&gt; at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably "Lucy", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably ''[[Sivapithecus|Ramapithecus]]'', showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method.

Progress in [[DNA sequencing]], specifically [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and then [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA]] (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|M'charek|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-K436zeUY8C&amp;pg=PA96 96]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008"&gt;{{harvnb|DeSalle|Tattersall|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf4Sitw7YaIC&amp;pg=PA146 146]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trent|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=772BEp8ZyMYC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of the [[molecular clock]] principle revolutionized the study of [[molecular evolution]].

On the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20 million years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimps noted above. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78 children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimps to an earlier period greater than 7 million years ago ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]). Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimp populations in 8 locations suggests that chimps reproduce at age 26.5 years, on average; which suggests the human divergence from chimps occurred between 7 and 13 million years ago. And these data suggest that ''Ardipithecus'' (4.5 Ma), ''Orrorin'' (6 Ma) and ''Sahelanthropus'' (7 Ma) all may be on the hominid [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]], and even that the separation may have occurred outside the [[East African Rift]] region.

Furthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies mating between "proto-human" and "proto-chimps" nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new [[gene pool]]:
: A new comparison of the human and chimp genomes suggests that after the two lineages separated, they may have begun interbreeding... A principal finding is that the [[X chromosome]]s of humans and chimps appear to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] about 1.2 million years more recently than the other chromosomes.
The research suggests:
: There were in fact two splits between the human and chimp lineages, with the first being followed by interbreeding between the two populations and then a second split. The suggestion of a hybridization has startled [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]], who nonetheless are treating the new genetic data seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=May 18, 2006 |title=Two Splits Between Human and Chimp Lines Suggested |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/science/18evolve.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The quest for the earliest hominin===
In the 1990s, several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage from the great apes. In 1994, Meave Leakey discovered ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]''. The find was overshadowed by Tim D. White's 1995 discovery of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', which pushed back the fossil record to {{ma|4.2}}.

In 2000, [[Martin Pickford]] and [[Brigitte Senut]] discovered, in the [[Tugen Hills]] of [[Kenya]], a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named ''[[Orrorin|Orrorin tugenensis]]''. And in 2001, a team led by [[Michel Brunet (paleontologist)|Michel Brunet]] discovered the skull of ''[[Sahelanthropus|Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' which was dated as {{ma|7.2|million years ago}}, and which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominid—that is, a hominin ({{lang|la|{{abbr|cf|confer}}}} Hominidae; [[Hominidae|terms "hominids" and hominins]]).

Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the genus ''Homo''. Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues. According to the [[Sahara pump theory]] evidence suggests that genus ''Homo'' have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. ''Homo erectus'', ''Homo heidelbergensis'' and two or three times for ''Homo sapiens''). Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B.  deMenocal, (2016) "Climate Shocks" (Scientific American Vol 25, No 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years earlier than previously thought.  A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6 million years.  This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus ''Homo'' at [[Dmanisi]], in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], dating to 1.85 million years.  Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that  humans used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Barras, Colin (2016), "Stone Tools hint humans reached Asia much earlier" (New Scientist 6 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the Asian "Chopper" tool tradition, found in Java and northern China may have left Africa before the appearance of the [[Acheulian]] hand axe.

====Dispersal of modern ''Homo sapiens''====
Up until the genetic evidence became available there were two dominant models for the dispersal of modern humans.  The [[Multiregional Evolution|multiregional hypothesis]] proposed that the genus ''Homo'' contained only a single interconnected population as it does today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple of million years. This model was proposed in 1988 by [[Milford H. Wolpoff]].&lt;ref name="multiregional"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolpoff |first1=Milford H. |authorlink1=Milford H.

Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the Out of Africa theory and weakened the views of Multiregional Evolutionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webster|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdiy1EhJVW0C&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramachandran|Hua Tang|Gutenkunst|Bustamante|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlfPSpBvKLgC&amp;pg=PA606 606]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses have shown a greater diversity of DNA patterns throughout Africa, consistent with the idea that Africa is the ancestral home of [[mitochondrial Eve]] and [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], and that modern human dispersal out of Africa has only occurred over the last 55,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutty|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUqYgipyiGMC&amp;pg=PA40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Out of Africa" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male [[Y chromosome]]. After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed [[Mitochondrial Eve]]. "Out of Africa" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations.&lt;ref name="Cann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cann |first1=Rebecca L. |authorlink1=Rebecca L.

These new results do not contradict the "out of Africa" model, except in its strictest interpretation, although they make the situation more complex. After recovery from a [[genetic bottleneck]] that could possibly be due to the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba supervolcano catastrophe]], a fairly small group left Africa and later briefly interbred on three separate occasions with Neanderthals, probably in the middle-east, on the Eurasian steppe or even in North Africa before their departure. Their still predominantly African descendants spread to populate the world. A fraction in turn interbred with Denisovans, probably in south-east Asia, before populating Melanesia.&lt;ref name="Reich_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reich |first1=David |last2=Patterson |first2=Nick |last3=Kircher |first3=Martin |last4=Delfin |first4=Frederick |last5=Nandineni |first5=Madhusudan R. |last6=Pugach |first6=Irina |last7=Ko |first7=Albert Min-Shan |last8=Ko |first8=Ying-Chin |last9=Jinam |first9=Timothy A. |last10=Phipps |first10=Maude E. |last11=Saitou |first11=Naruya |last12=Wollstein |first12=Andreas |last13=Kayser |first13=Manfred |last14=Pääbo |first14=Svante |last15=Stoneking |first15=Mark |display-authors=3 |date=October 7, 2011 |title=Denisova Admixture and the First Modern Human Dispersals into Southeast Asia and Oceania |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=516–528 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.09.005 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=3188841 |pmid=21944045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] haplotypes of Neanderthal and Denisova origin have been identified in modern Eurasian and [[Oceania]]n populations.&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1209202" /&gt;  The Denisovan [[EPAS1]] gene has also been found in Tibetan populations.&lt;ref&gt;Huertha Sanchez, Emilia et al (2014), "Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA" (Nature Vol 512, 14 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from Africa or several.

In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the [[Horn of Africa]] crossing the Bab el Mandib to Yemen at a lower sea level around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="lahr" /&gt;  This group seems to have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival.

[[Stephen Oppenheimer]] has proposed a second wave of humans may have later dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases, and the Zagros mountains into the Middle East.  Alternatively it may have come across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] into Asia, from shortly after 50,000 yrs BP, resulting in the bulk of the human populations of Eurasia. It has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated "big game hunting" tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group.

Stephen Oppenheimer, on the basis of the early date of Badoshan Iranian Aurignacian, suggests that this second dispersal, may have occurred with a pluvial period about 50,000 years before the present, with modern human big-game hunting cultures spreading up the Zagros Mountains, carrying modern human genomes from Oman, throughout the Persian Gulf, northward into Armenia and Anatolia, with a variant travelling south into Israel and to Cyrenicia.&lt;ref name = oppenheimer&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen (2012), "Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World" (Robinson; New Ed edition (March 1, 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes from many fields of [[natural science]]. The main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] and especially [[evolutionary developmental biology]] of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved. The specific study of the origin and life of humans is [[anthropology]], particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanford|Allen|Antón|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The splitting date between hominin and chimpanzee lineages is placed by some between {{Mya|4|8}}, that is, during the [[Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Dawkins R 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|2004}}

Initial divergence occurred sometime between {{Mya|7|13}}, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final divergence at {{Mya|5|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = N | last2 = Richter | first2 = DJ | last3 = Gnerre | first3 = S | last4 = Lander | first4 = ES | last5 = Reich | first5 = D | year = 2006 | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7097| pages = 1103–8 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | pmid = 16710306 | bibcode = 2006Natur.441.1103P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic evidence has also been employed to resolve the question of whether there was any [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals]], and to enhance our understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor.

Each time a certain mutation ([[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

====Genetics====
{{Main|Human evolutionary genetics|Human genetic variation}}
Human evolutionary genetics studies how one [[human genome]] differs from the other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects. Differences between genomes have [[Anthropology|anthropological]], [[medical]] and [[Forensic science|forensic]] implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution.

===Evidence from the fossil record===
[[File:Homo habilis-KNM ER 1813.jpg|thumb|upright|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo habilis]]''. Fossil number KNM ER 1813, found at [[Koobi Fora]], [[Kenya]].]]
[[File:Homo ergaster.jpg|thumb|upright|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (African ''Homo erectus''). Fossil number Khm-Heu 3733 discovered in 1975 in Kenya.]]
There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begun |first=David R. |date=October 2010 |title=Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=39 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105047 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' dating from {{mya|7}}, ''Orrorin tugenensis'' dating from {{mya|5.7}}, and ''[[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus kadabba|Ardipithecus kadabba]]'' dating to {{mya|5.6}}. Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins but, in each case, the claims have been contested. It is also possible that one or more of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes.

The question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species, the australopithecines arose around {{mya|4}} and diverged into [[Paranthropus|robust]] (also called ''[[Paranthropus]]'') and [[Australopithecus|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') probably went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''. The australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is ''Australopithecus afarensis'' with more than one hundred fossil individuals represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous "Lucy"), to Kenya, and [[South Africa]]. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as ''Au. robustus'' (or alternatively ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'') and ''Au./P. boisei'' are particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]], and around [[Lake Turkana]] in Kenya.

The earliest member of the genus ''Homo'' is ''Homo habilis'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.8}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of the use of stone tools. They developed the [[Oldowan]] lithic technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in which the first specimens were found. Some scientists consider ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'', a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original ''H. habilis'' fossils, to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of ''H. habilis''—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even [[sexual dimorphism]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.

During the next million years, a process of encephalization began and, by the arrival (about {{Mya|1.9}}) of ''Homo erectus'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominins to emigrate from Africa, and, from {{Mya|1.8|1.3}}, this species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species ''Homo ergaster'', remained in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species, ''H. erectus'' and ''H. ergaster'', were the first to use fire and complex tools.

The earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and archaic ''H. sapiens'' are from Africa, such as ''Homo rhodesiensis'', but seemingly transitional forms were also found at [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into ''H. antecessor'', ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''. The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia; later fossils from [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Es Skhul]] cave in [[Israel]] and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago ({{Mya|0.09}}).

As modern humans spread out from Africa, they encountered other hominins such as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and the so-called Denisovans, who may have evolved from populations of ''Homo erectus'' that had left Africa around {{mya|2}}. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2009|pp=[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9980-9_3#page-1 17–27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-01302012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Alanna |date=January 30, 2012 |title=DNA Turning Human Story Into a Tell-All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/science/gains-in-dna-are-speeding-research-into-human-origins.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70,000 years [[Before Present|BP]] and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14,500 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Bernard A. |date=December 1996 |title=Human evolution |journal=BioEssays |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=945–954 |doi=10.1002/bies.950181204 |issn=0265-9247 |pmid=8976151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-species breeding===
{{further|Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans}}
The hypothesis of interbreeding, also known as hybridization, admixture or hybrid-origin theory, has been discussed ever since the discovery of Neanderthal remains in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huxley | first=T. | title=Collected Essays: Volume VII, Man's Place in Nature | year=1890 | chapter=The Aryan Question and Pre-Historic Man | url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear view of human evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely. In the 21st century with the advent of molecular biology techniques and computerization, [[whole-genome sequencing]] of Neanderthal and human [[genome]] were performed, confirming recent admixture between different human species.&lt;ref name=greends&gt;{{cite journal | last=Green | first=R.E. |author2=Krause, J. |author3=Briggs, A.W. |author4=Maricic, T. |author5=Stenzel, U. |author6=Kircher, M. |title=A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome | journal=Science | year=2010 | volume=328 | issue=5979 | pages=710–22 | doi=10.1126/science.1188021 | pmid=20448178|display-authors=etal | pmc=5100745|bibcode=2010Sci...328..710G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, evidence based on molecular biology was published, revealing unambiguous examples of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and early [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The surviving tropical population of primates—which is seen most completely in the Upper Eocene and lowermost [[Oligocene]] fossil beds of the [[Faiyum]] depression southwest of [[Cairo]]—gave rise to all extant primate species, including the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]], [[loris]]es of Southeast Asia, [[galago]]s or "bush babies" of Africa, and to the [[Simian|anthropoids]], which are the [[New World monkey|Platyrrhine]]s or New World monkeys, the [[Catarrhini|Catarrhine]]s or Old World monkeys, and the great apes, including humans and other hominids.

The earliest known [[Catarrhini|catarrhine]] is ''[[Kamoyapithecus]]'' from uppermost Oligocene at Eragaleit in the northern [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] in Kenya, dated to 24 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnqzb4_UVfkC&amp;pg=PA76 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ancestry is thought to be species related to ''[[Aegyptopithecus]]'', ''[[Propliopithecus]]'', and ''[[Parapithecus]]'' from the Faiyum, at around 35 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YoyQQEOKGVQC&amp;pg=PA240 240]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[Saadanius]]'' was described as a close relative of the last common ancestor of the [[Crown group|crown]] catarrhines, and tentatively dated to 29–28 million years ago, helping to fill an 11-million-year gap in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="2010Zalmout"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zalmout |first1=Iyad S. |last2=Sanders |first2=William J. |authorlink2=William J.

In the [[Early Miocene]], about 22 million years ago, the many kinds of [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreally]] adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed to ''[[Victoriapithecus]]'', the earliest Old World monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', ''[[Rangwapithecus]]'', ''[[Dendropithecus]]'', ''[[Limnopithecus]]'', ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'', ''[[Equatorius]]'', ''[[Nyanzapithecus pickfordi|Nyanzapithecus]]'', ''[[Afropithecus]]'', ''Heliopithecus'', and ''[[Kenyapithecus]]'', all from East Africa.

The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of [[Middle Miocene]] from sites far distant—''[[Otavipithecus]]'' from cave deposits in Namibia, and ''[[Pierolapithecus]]'' and ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' from [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Austria]]—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the Early and Middle Miocene. The youngest of the [[Miocene]] hominoids, ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', is from coal beds in [[Italy]] that have been dated to 9 million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae) diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12 million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from [[Turkey]], dated to around 10 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Srivastava|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kCerOsM8XMwC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divergence of the human clade from other great apes===
[[File:Lucy-reconstruction.jpg|thumb|upright|A reconstruction of "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]", a female ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' on exhibit in the [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington, D.C.]], US.]]
Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by ''[[Nakalipithecus]]'' fossils found in Kenya and ''[[Ouranopithecus]]'' found in [[Greece]]. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation—rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone—and [[sampling bias]] probably contribute to this problem.

Other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, horses, and others. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the split—thought to have occurred around that time—of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees. The earliest fossils argued by some to belong to the human lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (7 Ma) and ''Orrorin tugenensis'' (6 Ma), followed by ''Ardipithecus'' (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species ''Ar. kadabba'' and ''[[Ar. ramidus]]''.

It has been argued in a study of the life history of ''Ar. ramidus'' that the species provides evidence for a suite of anatomical and behavioral adaptations in very early hominins unlike any species of extant great ape.&lt;ref name="aramidus"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=G. |last2=Henneberg |first2=M. |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: a heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=[[Anthropological Review]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=109–132 |date=June 2015 |url= http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/anre.2015.78.issue-2/anre-2015-0009/anre-2015-0009.xml?format=INT |accessdate=2015-07-22 |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated affinities between the skull morphology of ''Ar. ramidus'' and that of infant and juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting the species evolved a juvenalised or [[paedomorphic]] craniofacial morphology via [[heterochrony|heterochronic]] dissociation of growth trajectories. It was also argued that the species provides support for the notion that very early hominins, akin to bonobos (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') the less aggressive species of chimpanzee, may have evolved via the process of [[self-domestication]]. Consequently, arguing against the so-called "chimpanzee referential model"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sayers, K. |display-authors=etal |title=Human Evolution and the Chimpanzee refernatial Model |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |volume=41 |pages=119–138 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145815|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the authors suggest it is no longer tenable to use [[common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes'') social and mating behaviors in models of early hominin social evolution. When commenting on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in ''Ar. ramidus'' and the implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology, they wrote:

{{quote|Of course ''Ar. ramidus''  differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that ''Ar. ramidus'' shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in  ''Ar. ramidus'' than what we see in bonobos.{{r|aramidus|page1=128}}}}

The authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] Africa. Consequently, they argue that humans may not represent evolution from a chimpanzee-like ancestor as has traditionally been supposed. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent [[phylogeny|phylogenetically]] deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans.

===Genus ''Australopithecus''===
{{Main|Australopithecus}}
The genus ''Australopithecus'' evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]''. There is still some debate among academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as ''[[Australopithecus robustus|Au. robustus]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus boisei|Au. boisei]]'', constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be ''Au. robust australopiths'' whilst the others would be considered ''Au. gracile australopiths''. However, if these species do indeed constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, the ''Paranthropus''.
* ''[[Australopithecus]]'' (4–1.8 Ma), with species ''[[Australopithecus anamensis|Au. anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali|Au. bahrelghazali]]'', ''[[Australopithecus garhi|Au. garhi]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'';
* ''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (3–2.7 Ma), with species ''[[Kenyanthropus|K. platyops]]'';
* ''[[Paranthropus]]'' (3–1.2 Ma), with species ''[[Paranthropus aethiopicus|P. aethiopicus]]'', ''[[Paranthropus boisei|P. boisei]]'', and ''[[Paranthropus robustus|P. robustus]]''
A new proposed species ''[[Australopithecus deyiremeda]]'' is claimed to have been discovered living at the same time period of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]''.  There is debate if [[Australopithecus afarensis|Au.]] [[Australopithecus deyiremeda|deyiremeda]] is a new species or is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |date=May 27, 2015 |title=The Human Family Tree Bristles With New Branches |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/adding-branches-to-the-human-family-tree.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australopithecus prometheus'', otherwise known as [[Little Foot]] has recently been dated at 3.67 million years old through a new dating technique, making the genus ''Australopithecus'' as old as ''afarensis''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner., Elizabeth K.; Purdue University (April 1, 2015). "New instrument dates old skeleton before 'Lucy'; 'Little Foot' 3.67 million years old". Science Daily. Retrieved April 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the opposable big toe found on Little Foot, it seems that he was a good climber, and it is thought given the night predators of the region, he probably, like gorillas and chimpanzees, built a nesting platform at night, in the trees.

==Evolution of genus ''Homo''==

The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a [[chimpanzee]], although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human [[SRGAP2]] [[gene]] doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex. During the next million years a process of rapid [[encephalization]] occurred, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' in the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]], cranial capacity had doubled to 850&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such an increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000 more [[neuron]]s than their parents.) It is believed that ''Homo erectus'' and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' were the first to use fire and complex tools, and were the first of the hominin line to leave Africa, spreading throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe between {{Mya|1.3|1.8}}.

According to the recent African origin of modern humans theory, modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'' or ''[[Homo antecessor]]'' and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, gradually replacing local populations of ''Homo erectus'', [[Denisovan|Denisova hominins]], ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' and ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]''.&lt;ref name="encylopediahumanevolution"&gt;{{harvnb|Stringer|1994|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolutionthe1st4billionyears"&gt;{{harvnb|McHenry|2009|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Out of Africa Revisited |date=May 13, 2005 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |type=This Week in ''Science'' |volume=308 |issue=5724 |page=921 |doi=10.1126/science.308.5724.921g |issn=0036-8075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stringer |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Stringer |date=June 12, 2003 |title=Human evolution: Out of Ethiopia |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=423 |issue=6941 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/423692a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12802315 |bibcode=2003Natur.423..692S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/johanson.html |title=Origins of Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out of Africa? |last=Johanson |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Johanson |date=May 2001 |website=[[actionbioscience]] |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaic humans|Archaic ''Homo sapiens'']], the forerunner of [[anatomically modern humans]], evolved in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Mixon |first1=Bobbie |last2=Ehardt |first2=Carolyn |last3=Hammer |first3=Michael |date=September 6, 2011 |title=Evolution's Past Is Modern Human's Present |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?org=NSF&amp;cntn_id=121603&amp;preview=false |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |id=Press Release 11-181 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_4.htm |title=Early Modern Homo sapiens |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |website=Evolution of Modern Humans: A Survey of the Biological and Cultural Evolution of Archaic and Modern Homo sapiens |publisher=[[Palomar College]] |location=San Marcos, CA |type=Tutorial |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fossil Reanalysis Pushes Back Origin of ''Homo sapiens'' |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fossil-reanalysis-pushes/ |date=February 17, 2005 |journal=[[Scientific American]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[DNA]] evidence suggests that several [[haplotype]]s of [[Neanderthal]] origin are present among all non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as [[Denisovan]]s, may have contributed up to 6% of their [[genome]] to present-day humans, suggestive of a [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|limited inter-breeding between these species]].&lt;ref name="pmid21179161"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reich |first1=David |authorlink1=David Reich (geneticist) |last2=Green |first2=Richard E. |last3=Kircher |first3=Martin |last4=Krause |last5=Patterson |last6=Durand |last7=Viola |last8=Briggs |last9=Stenzel |last10=Johnson |last11=Maricic |last12=Good |last13=Marques-Bonet |last14=Alkan |last15=Fu |last16=Mallick |last17=Li |last18=Meyer |last19=Eichler |last20=Stoneking |last21=Richards |last22=Talamo |last23=Shunkov |last24=Derevianko |last25=Hublin |last26=Kelso |last27=Slatkin |last28=Pääbo |displayauthors=3 |date=December 23, 2010 |title=Genetic history of an archaic hominin group from Denisova Cave in Siberia |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7327 |pages=1053–1060 |bibcode=2010Natur.468.1053R |doi=10.1038/nature09710 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=21179161|pmc=4306417 |hdl=10230/25596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20439435"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noonan |first=James P. |date=May 2010 |title=Neanderthal genomics and the evolution of modern humans |journal=[[Genome Research]] |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=547–553 |doi=10.1101/gr.076000.108 |issn=1088-9051 |pmc=2860157 |pmid=20439435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1209202"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abi-Rached |first1=Laurent |last2=Jobin |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Kulkarni |first3=Subhash |last4=McWhinnie |first4=A. |last5=Dalva |first5=K. |last6=Gragert |first6=L. |last7=Babrzadeh |first7=F. |last8=Gharizadeh |first8=B. |last9=Luo |first9=M. |last10=Plummer |first10=F.

===''H. habilis'' and ''H. gautengensis''===
''Homo habilis'' lived from about 2.8&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; to 1.4 Ma. The species evolved in South and East Africa in the [[Piacenzian|Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]], 2.5–2 Ma, when it diverged from the australopithecines. ''Homo habilis'' had smaller molars and larger brains than the australopithecines, and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones. One of the first known hominins was nicknamed 'handy man' by discoverer [[Louis Leakey]] due to its association with [[stone tool]]s. Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of ''Homo'' and into ''Australopithecus'' due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to [[Arboreal locomotion|living on trees]] rather than to [[bipedalism|moving on two legs]] like ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Bernard |last2=Collard |first2=Mark |year=1999 |title=The changing face of Genus ''Homo'' |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=195–207 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)8:6&lt;195::AID-EVAN1&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 |issn=1060-1538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''H. ergaster'' and ''H. erectus''===
The first fossils of ''Homo erectus'' were discovered by Dutch physician [[Eugene Dubois]] in 1891 on the [[Indonesia]]n island of Java. He originally named the material ''[[Anthropopithecus|Anthropopithecus erectus]]'' (1892-1893, considered at this point as a chimpanzee-like fossil primate) and ''[[Pithecanthropus|Pithecanthropus erectus]]'' (1893-1894, changing his mind as of based on its morphology, which he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=William |authorlink=William Turner Thiselton-Dyer |date=April 1895 |title=On M. Dubois' Description of Remains recently found in Java, named by him ''Pithecanthropus erectus''.

Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} ''Homo erectus'' lived from about 1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago—which would indicate that they were probably wiped out by the Toba catastrophe; however, nearby ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' survived it. The early phase of ''Homo erectus'', from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered by some to be a separate species, ''Homo ergaster'', or as ''Homo erectus ergaster'', a subspecies of ''Homo erectus''.

In Africa in the Early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, some populations of ''Homo habilis'' are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, ''Homo erectus''—in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoor |first1=Fred |last2=Wood |first2=Bernard A. |last3=Zonneveld |first3=Frans |date=June 23, 1994 |title=Implications of early hominid labyrinthine morphology for evolution of human bipedal locomotion |journal=Nature |volume=369 |issue=6482 |pages=645–648 |bibcode=1994Natur.369..645S |doi=10.1038/369645a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=8208290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes. This species also may have used fire to cook meat.

A famous example of ''Homo erectus'' is [[Peking Man]]; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists now use the term ''Homo ergaster'' for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve ''Homo erectus'' only for those fossils that are found in Asia and meet certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from ''H. ergaster''.

There are a number of clear anatomical differences between [[anatomically modern humans]] (AMH) and Neanderthal populations. Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their [[surface to volume ratio]] is an extreme version of that found amongst [[Inuit]] populations, indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent research by Eiluned Pearce, Chris Stringer, R. I. M. Dunbar, however, have shown important differences in Brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the [[occipital lobe]], the larger size suggests that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans.  This would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial Europe.  It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control.&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Eiluned |last1=Pearce|first2= Chris|last2= Stringer|first3= R.

The Neanderthal populations seem to have been physically superior to AMH populations. These differences may have been sufficient to give Neanderthal populations an environmental superiority to AMH populations from 75,000 to 45,000 years BP. With these differences, Neanderthal brains show a smaller area was available for social functioning. Plotting group size possible from endocrainial volume, suggests that AMH populations (minus occipital lobe size), had a [[Dunbars number]] of 144 possible relationships. Neanderthal populations seem to have been limited to about 120 individuals. This would show up in a larger number of possible mates for AMH humans, with increased risks of inbreeding amongst Neanderthal populations. It also suggests that humans had larger trade catchment areas than Neanderthals (confirmed in the distribution of stone tools).

The flow of genes from Neanderthal populations to modern human was not all one way.  Sergi Castellano of the Max Planck Institute for [[Evolutionary Anthropology]] in Leipzig, Germany, has in 2016 reported that while Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us, Siberian Neanderthal genomes show similarity to the modern human gene pool, more so than to European Neanderthal populations.  The evidence suggests that the Neanderthal populations interbred with modern humans possibly 100,000 years ago, probably somewhere in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature16544 | volume=530 | issue=7591 | title=Ancient gene flow from early modern humans into Eastern Neanderthals | journal=Nature | pages=429–433 | pmid=26886800 | pmc=4933530 | last1 = Kuhlwilm | first1 = M | last2 = Gronau | first2 = I | last3 = Hubisz | first3 = MJ | last4 = de Filippo | first4 = C | last5 = Prado-Martinez | first5 = J | last6 = Kircher | first6 = M | last7 = Fu | first7 = Q | last8 = Burbano | first8 = HA | last9 = Lalueza-Fox | first9 = C | last10 = de la Rasilla | first10 = M | last11 = Rosas | first11 = A | last12 = Rudan | first12 = P | last13 = Brajkovic | first13 = D | last14 = Kucan | first14 = Ž | last15 = Gušic | first15 = I | last16 = Marques-Bonet | first16 = T | last17 = Andrés | first17 = AM | last18 = Viola | first18 = B | last19 = Pääbo | first19 = S | last20 = Meyer | first20 = M | last21 = Siepel | first21 = A | last22 = Castellano | first22 = S| bibcode = 2016Natur.530..429K | year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''H. floresiensis'', which lived from approximately 190,000 to 50,000 years before present, has been nicknamed ''[[hobbit]]'' for its small size, possibly a result of [[insular dwarfism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Peter |last2=Sutikna |first2=Thomas |last3=Morwood |first3=Michael J. |authorlink3=Mike Morwood |last4=Soejono |first4=Raden Panji |authorlink4=Raden Panji Soejono |last5=Jatmiko |first5=Ako |last6=Wayhu Saptomo |first6=E. |last7=Awe Due |first7=Rokus |date=October 28, 2004 |title=A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7012 |pages=1055–1061 |bibcode=2004Natur.431.1055B |doi=10.1038/nature02999 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15514638 |display-authors=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. floresiensis'' is intriguing both for its size and its age, being an example of a recent species of the genus ''Homo'' that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words, ''H. floresiensis'' shares a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path. The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in 2003, it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old. The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the ''H. sapiens'' average of 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

This, coupled with pathological dwarfism, could have resulted in a significantly diminutive human. The other major attack on ''H. floresiensis'' as a separate species is that it was found with tools only associated with ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain [[Homo floresiensis#Additional features|additional anatomical features]] that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and feet. Additionally, this hypothesis fails to explain the find of multiple examples of individuals with these same characteristics, indicating they were common to a large population, and not limited to one individual. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) [[Osteodontokeratic culture|may have used broken bones as tools]], but this is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-kOvkb-xbU8C&amp;pg=PA398 398]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Wood noted that ''Paranthropus'' co-existed with the early ''Homo'' species in the area of the "Oldowan Industrial Complex" over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies ''Paranthropus'' as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early ''Homo'' species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, ''Homo'' was always present, but ''Paranthropus'' was not.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the ''Homo'' and ''Paranthropus'' species were toolmakers. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed toolmakers.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;

===Stone tools===
{{Main|Stone tool}}
[[Stone tool]]s are first attested around 2.6 Million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core [[Oldowan|tools]], [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plummer |first=Thomas |year=2004 |title=Flaked stones and old bones: Biological and cultural evolution at the dawn of technology |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=Supplement 39 (''Yearbook of Physical Anthropology'') |pages=118–164 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20157 |issn=0002-9483 |pmid=15605391}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]], or Old [[Stone Age]]; its end is taken to be the end of the last [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], around 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (Early Stone Age), ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago, the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (Middle Stone Age), until 50,000–30,000 years ago, and the [[Upper Paleolithic]], (Late Stone Age), 50,000-10,000 years ago.

Archaeologists working in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya have discovered the oldest known stone tools in the world. Dated to around 3.3 million years ago, the implements are some 700,000 years older than stone tools from Ethiopia that previously held this distinction.&lt;ref name="Harmand 310–315"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wong |first=Kate |date=April 15, 2015 |title=Archaeologists Take Wrong Turn, Find World's Oldest Stone Tools |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2015/04/15/archaeologists-take-wrong-turn-find-worlds-oldest-stone-tools/ |journal=Scientific American |type=Blog |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balter |first=Michael |date=April 14, 2015 |title=World's oldest stone tools discovered in Kenya |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2015/04/world-s-oldest-stone-tools-discovered-kenya |journal=Science |type=News |doi=10.1126/science.aab2487 |issn=0036-8075 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Drake |first=Nadia |date=April 16, 2015 |title=Oldest Stone Tools Discovered in Kenya |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150416-oil-fish-hearts-spill-tuna-gulf-bp-deepwater-exxon-alaska/150416-oldest-stone-tools-archaeology-kenya-human-origins-evolution/ |work=National Geographic News |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 700,000–300,000 years ago is also known as the [[Acheulean]], when ''H. ergaster'' (or ''erectus'') made large stone [[hand axe]]s out of [[flint]] and [[quartzite]], at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later "[[retouch (lithics)|retouched]]" by additional, more-subtle strikes at the sides of the [[lithic flake|flakes]]. After 350,000 BP the more refined so-called [[Levallois technique]] was developed, a series of consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers ("racloirs"), needles, and flattened needles were made.&lt;ref name=Plummer/&gt; Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the immigrant [[Cro-Magnon]]s (knives, blades, skimmers). In this period they also started to make tools out of bone.

==Transition to behavioral modernity==
{{See|Behavioral modernity}}
Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (''H. habilis'', ''H. ergaster'', ''H. neanderthalensis'') started at a higher level than the previous one, but after each phase started, further development was slow. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these ''Homo'' species possessed some or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans such as language, complex symbolic thinking, technological creativity etc. It seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods.

Around 50,000 BP, modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by most as a Eurasian "Great Leap Forward",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the "Upper Palaeolithic Revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bar-Yosef |first=Ofer |authorlink=Ofer Bar-Yosef |date=October 2002 |title=The Upper Paleolithic Revolution |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=31 |pages=363–393 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085416 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern behavior and [[big game hunting]]&lt;ref name="oppenheimer" /&gt; in the archaeological record. Some other scholars consider the transition to have been more gradual, noting that some features had already appeared among archaic African ''Homo sapiens'' since 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nowell |first=April |date=October 2010 |title=Defining Behavioral Modernity in the Context of Neandertal and Anatomically Modern Human Populations |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=39 |pages=437–452 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105113 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=d'Errico |first1=Francesco |last2=Stringer |first2=Chris B. |date=April 12, 2011 |title=Evolution, revolution or saltation scenario for the emergence of modern cultures? |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=366 |issue=1567 |pages=1060–1069 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0340 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=3049097 |pmid=21357228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent evidence suggests that the Australian Aboriginal population separated from the African population 75,000 years ago, and that they made a sea journey of up to 160&amp;nbsp;km 60,000 years ago, which may diminish the evidence of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1211177 |pmid=21940856 |pmc=3991479 |title=An Aboriginal Australian Genome Reveals Separate Human Dispersals into Asia |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6052 |pages=94–8 |year=2011 |last1=Rasmussen |first1=M |last2=Guo |first2=X |last3=Wang |first3=Y |last4=Lohmueller |first4=K.

Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using [[trapping pit]]s or driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in [[cave painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ambrose |first=Stanley H. |date=March 2, 2001 |title=Paleolithic Technology and Human Evolution |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5509 |pages=1748–1753 |bibcode=2001Sci...291.1748A |doi=10.1126/science.1059487 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11249821}}&lt;/ref&gt; As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons, and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations do not vary in their technologies, although the [[Chatelperronian]] assemblages have been found to be Neanderthal innovations produced as a result of exposure to the Homo sapiens [[Aurignacian]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellars | first1 = P | year = 2010 | title = Neanderthal symbolism and ornament manufacture: The bursting of a bubble? | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume =  107| issue = 47| pages =  20147–20148| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1014588107 | pmid=21078972 | pmc=2996706| bibcode =2010PNAS..10720147M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among concrete examples of [[modern human behavior]], anthropologists include specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and [[barter]] trade networks. Debate continues as to whether a "revolution" led to modern humans ("the big bang of human consciousness"), or whether the evolution was more "gradual".&lt;ref name="Mcbrearty_Brooks" /&gt;

==Recent and current human evolution==
{{main|Recent human evolution}}
Evolution has continued in [[anatomically modern human]] populations, which are affected by both natural selection and [[genetic drift]]. Although [[selection pressure]] on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in modern human life, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture (10,000 years ago), urban civilization (5,000), and [[industrialization]] (250 years ago). It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cochran|Harpending|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as [[Afro-textured hair]], or the recent evolution of [[light skin]] and [[blond]] hair in some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly strong selective pressures have resulted in [[high-altitude adaptation in humans]], with different ones in different isolated populations. Studies of the [[High-altitude adaptation in humans#Genetic basis|genetic basis]] show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of [[EPAS1]] that is adaptive to high altitudes.

Other evolution is related to [[endemic disease]]s: the presence of [[malaria]] selected for [[sickle cell trait]] (the [[heterozygote]] form of sickle cell gene), while the absence of malaria and the health effects of [[sickle-cell anemia]] select against this trait. For example, the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[PRNP|prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is due to the survival of immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Medical Research Council (UK) |authorlink=Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) |date=November 21, 2009 |title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' evolves in Papua New Guinea community; could offer insights Into CJD |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm |work=ScienceDaily |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid = 19923577| year = 2009| last1 = Mead | first1 = S.| last2 = Whitfield | first2 = J.| last3 = Poulter | first3 = M.| last4 = Shah | first4 = P.| last5 = Uphill | first5 = J.| last6 = Campbell | first6 = T.| last7 = Al-Dujaily | first7 = H.| last8 = Hummerich | first8 = H.| last9 = Beck | first9 = J.| last10 = Mein | first10 = C.

Recent human evolution related to agriculture includes genetic resistance to infectious disease that has appeared in human populations by crossing the species barrier from domesticated animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as changes in metabolism due to changes in diet, such as [[lactase persistence]].

In contemporary times, since industrialization, some trends have been observed: for instance, menopause is evolving to occur later.&lt;ref name="doi10.1073/pnas.0906199106"/&gt; Other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations.&lt;ref name="doi10.1073/pnas.0906199106"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = S.

The '''Institute for Social Anthropology''' ('''ISA''') is a research institute of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (AAS) in Vienna, Austria.

== Tasks and Aims ==

The Institute for Social Anthropology is an Asia-specialized research institute at the AAS. Its long-term research focus lies on "Consensus and Conflict in Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean". Special emphasis is placed on transnational developments in Asia, such as regional integration and cooperation, transformations of family and kinship relations, as well as regional and internal migration.

ISA’s medium-term research program (2012-2017) is entitled "Engaging with Crisis, Mobility and Transformations in Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean". It focuses on systemic and biographic crises in Asia’s past and present, on the relationships between crises and mobility, and on the role of major social, economic and political transformations in connection with this. In short, ISA’s research problematizes the ways in which Asian societies engage with crises, mobility and transformations.

Prof. [[Ulf Hannerz]] is the current chair and Prof. Regina Bendix the current deputy chair of ISA’s Scientific Advisory Board for the term 2014-2016.

== History and Structure ==

The roots of the current Institute for Social Anthropology can be traced back to March 2, 1938, when the erstwhile Commissions for "Research on Illiterate Languages of Non-European Peoples" and for "Publishing Songs and Texts Recorded in Prisoner of War Camps" at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] were merged into the new "Commission for Research on Primitive Cultures and Languages." As the Commission’s research focus increasingly turned to complex societies, in line with developments within anthropology at the time, it was renamed "Ethnological Commission" on November 22, 1961. In the years between 1955 and 1965, Prof. [[Robert Heine-Geldern]] established a focus on the region of Southeast Asia for the first time in the history of AAS.

From 1980 to 2000 Prof. [[Walter Dostal]] substantially expanded the already existing focus on Southeast Asia by two additional core fields – South-Western Arabia and Tibet.
A second institutional merger took place under Prof. [[Walter Dostal]] on January 1, 1993, when the "Arabic Commission" was integrated into the Ethnological Commission, resulting both in an interdisciplinary approach that provided a strong foundation for research on intercultural relations, and in a special emphasis on language competency in its anthropological work.

As it became clear that the term "ethnos" did not adequately capture anthropology’s research focus on the human anymore, the Commission for Ethnology was renamed, on January 18, 1995, to "Commission for Social Anthropology." Since 1995, this socio-anthropological research approach follows an interdisciplinary program by conducting empirical and ethnographic investigations in connection with philological and historical analyses and intercultural comparative studies of socio-cultural phenomena. The award of the [http://www.oeaw.ac.at/wittgenstein2000/e_index.htm Wittgenstein prize] to Prof. [[Andre Gingrich]] in the year 2000 marked the start of a new era at the Commission.

On January 1, 2007, the "Commission for Social Anthropology" was transformed into a Research Unit as part of the "Center for Studies in Asian Cultures and Social Anthropology," and awarded temporary institutional status as the "Institute for Social Anthropology" on January 1, 2010. Following a successful external evaluation, it was granted permanent status on September 15, 2011.

Today, the Institute for Social Anthropology constitutes one of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]’ flagship institutes in the humanities and social sciences, and counts among the top European research institutions in anthropology.

== Regional foci ==

ISA’s regional foci and expertise encompass: 1) the Islamic Middle East and North Africa, 2) primarily Buddhist Central Asia and the Tibetan language-speaking Himalayan regions, as well as 3) Southeast Asia and the islands of the Indian Ocean.

Researchers on the Middle East examine, inter alia, social transformations and conflicts of South-Western Arabia past and present and the memory of crimes against humanity among Kurdish people. In Central Asia, Tibet and the Himalayan region, staff carry out research on imperial-time and early Buddhist Tibet, Tibetan medicine, and nomadic artefacts. 
Ongoing projects in the region of Southeast Asia and the islands of the Indian Ocean include research on health-related mobility and tourism in the Republic of Maldives, on cognitive concepts among the Maniq-Semang in Southern Thailand, and on social media and Islamic practices in Indonesia.

Methodologically, ISA pursues gender-sensitive ethnographic fieldwork carried out in local languages and systematic cross-cultural comparison in its analyses and interpretations of socio-cultural processes in the past and present.

== Events ==

Since 2002, ISA co-organizes the international [https://web.archive.org/web/20151125231629/http://ksa.univie.ac.at/institut/veranstaltungen/ericwolflectures/ Eric Wolf Lectures] in collaboration with the [http://ksa.univie.ac.at/ Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology] of the [[University of Vienna]] and the [http://www.ifk.ac.at/ International Research Center for Cultural Studies (IFK)]. Every year, a prominent representative of the discipline is invited to hold a public lecture. Since 2004, the Eric Wolf Lectures are published in [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/ca.html Current Anthropology].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Wolf Lectures|url=https://ksa.univie.ac.at/institut/veranstaltungen/ericwolflectures/|website=Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About eight times a year, the institute organizes its ISA International Guest Lectures, for which ISA invites researchers from all relevant fields and well-established lecturers. These lectures – mainly in English – are published in the institute’s working papers in Social Anthropology.&lt;ref name=aaspap&gt;{{cite web|title=AAS Working Papers in Social Anthropology|url=http://www.oeaw.ac.at/sozant/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=50&amp;lang=en|website=Institute for Social Anthropology|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every two years, ISA organizes an "International Anthropological Atelier" – a special workshop together with another European anthropological institute in order to share, discuss, and develop preliminary results of ongoing research. The outcomes of the workshop are published as an edited volume or a special focus section in a leading journal of the field.

ISA’s Research Forum is meant primarily as an internal forum for staff members of ISA or partner institutions to present new projects as well as the results of ongoing or already completed research.

Occasionally, ISA organizes or co-organizes domestic as well as international conferences and seminars on theoretical-methodological debates, special topics, or regional agendas. In 2004, ISA co-organized the [http://easaonline.org/conferences/easa2004/index.shtml 8th EASA Biennial Conference], in 2011 the [http://tagung2011.dgv-net.de/english_2011.html GAA Conference 2011], and in 2015 the [http://www.univie.ac.at/euroseas2015/ 8th EuroSEAS Conference] as well as the [https://chags.univie.ac.at/ 11th CHaGS Conference] in Vienna.

== Publications ==
Since 1996, ISA publishes the book series "[http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/Reihen/Veroeffentlichungen-zur-Sozialanthropologie Veröffentlichungen zur Sozialanthropologie]" ("Publications in Social Anthropology"). This series is available from the [http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/index Austrian Academy of Sciences Press].

Since 2008, AAS Working Papers in Social Anthropology appear several times a year. This series is available online and ''open access'' on the institute’s homepage.&lt;ref name=aaspap /&gt;

Another publication is the book series "[http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/Reihen/Sammlung-Eduard-Glaser Sammlung Eduard Glaser]", which is also available from the [http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/index Austrian Academy of Sciences Press].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4649">"'''Joke'''" is a [[comedy]] [[sketch comedy|sketch]] written and performed by [[English people|English]] [[comedian]]s [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]]. It was performed live during Atkinson's 1980 tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. A live recording was made at the [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on 19 or 20 September 1980 and released as the last track on Atkinson's [[live album|live]] comedy [[album]], ''[[Live in Belfast]]''.

==Synopsis==
At the start of the sketch, Rowan Atkinson's character tells Richard Curtis' character he's "got a [[joke]]". He goes on to explain, "It's one of those ones where I ask a question and you say 'I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot'." Rowan begins the joke by saying, "I say, I say, I say, what is the secret of great comedy?" Richard replies by literally saying, "I don't know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot." After laughing at his own wit, Richard tells the annoyed Rowan that he'll "do it again." Rowan repeats the question and Richard replies, "I don't know. What is the secret to great comedy?" However, before Richard can finish his reply, Rowan interrupts, "timing." The point of the joke is that Rowan deliberately got his timing wrong when saying that timing is the secret to great comedy; however, Richard does not understand the joke. Bewildered by Richard's stupidity, Rowan enquires, "But didn't you see?" "Sorry, was it a visual joke?" Richard replies, still confused. After trying the joke a third time, Richard still does not understand the [[irony]] of the joke. Annoyed by Richard, Rowan asks, "Don't you think that's a clever joke?" to which Richard replies, "Clever... no. Joke... no." Disheartened by his joke falling flat with Richard, he claims "it was very funny when Michael told it," then makes the excuse that his timing might be out to which Richard replies, "It could be other factors like the complete absence of anything funny in the joke." Rowan proclaims, "It's so difficult telling jokes," before suddenly exclaiming that he has another joke that is "far more straightforward" to which Richard replies, "As long as it's funny, I don't mind."

The second joke begins with Rowan saying, "Knock! Knock! Who's there? Death..." but he is interrupted by Richard who complains that [[knock-knock joke]]s "are meant to be two-handers". Rowan argues that this joke "doesn't work that way". It becomes apparent that Rowan is attempting to tell the same joke told by Toby, the [[Devil]], during a previous sketch. The joke is meant to go "Knock, Knock. Who's there? Death. Death wh..." at which point the person telling the joke pretends to die. If a second person was replying in the joke, they would not know to pretend to die when saying "Death who?". Richard protests and Rowan gives in and the pair attempt the knock-knock joke in the "old way". Richard, ignorant to the fact he is meant to say the [[punch line]], replies "Death who?" and Rowan replies "Ah, now, that's where it goes wrong." Rowan explains to Richard how he is meant to say the punch-line but after another attempt at the joke, Richard replies wrong. Rowan, getting increasingly more annoyed as the sketch goes on, says he has another joke and this time he will be "third time lucky".

Rowan explains that the third joke is "a very old joke but a very good joke". Rowan begins to tell the classic joke, which begins "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to [[Jamaica]]". The person replying is meant to say, "Jamaica?" which sounds like "D'you make 'er?" or "Did you make her?". The joke-teller then replies, "No, of her own accord." However, when Rowan says, "I say, I say, I say, my wife's gone to Jamaica," Richard replies, "Of her own accord?" which ruins the whole joke and causes Rowan to [[profanity|swear]] loudly and give up telling jokes to Richard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6015">'''Kinesics''' is the interpretation of body motion communication such as [[facial expression]]s and [[gesture]]s, nonverbal behavior related to movement of any part of the body or the body as a whole. The equivalent popular culture term is [[body language]], a term [[Ray Birdwhistell]], considered the founder of this area of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danesi|first1=M|title=Kinesics|journal=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|date=2006|pages=207–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither used nor liked (on the grounds that what can be conveyed with the body does not meet the linguist's definition of language).

==Birdwhistell's work==
Kinesics was first used in 1952 by an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] named [[Ray Birdwhistell]]. Birdwhistell wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. L. (1952). Introduction to ''Kinesics: An Annotation System for Analysis of Body Motion and Gesture''. Washington, DC: Department of State, Foreign Service Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book ''Kinesics and Context.''&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. 1970. ''Kinesics and Context''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behavior generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass market (nonacademic) publications as ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Nierenberg, G. I., &amp; Calero, H. H. (1971). ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''. New York: Hawthorn Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not clearly seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was ''The Natural History of an Interview,'' a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jump up ^ Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1987). The Social History of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. ''Research on Language and Social Interaction'', 20, 1-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing heavily on [[descriptive linguistics]], Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behavior has a [[grammar]] that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a "kineme" is "similar to a [[phoneme]] because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, M. 1972. ''Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction''. Reinhart and Winston, New York, pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. 1980. Profile: Ray L. Birdwhistell. ''The Kinesis Report'', 2, 3: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by [[Paul Ekman]], who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in [[facial expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557|doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern applications==
In a current application, kinesic behaviors are sometimes used as signs of [[deception]] by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally.

Relevant concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= Paul|year= 2004|title= Emotional and conversational nonverbal signals|journal= Language, knowledge, and representation|pages=39–50 |url= http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS120/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CE%9D%CF%8C%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7_2015/Ekman%20vs%20Russell/Ekman_Basic-Emotions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
*'''Emblems''' - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase
*'''Illustrators''' - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages
**Batons - Temporally accent or emphasize words or phrases
**[[Ideogram|Ideographs]] - Trace the paths of mental journeys
**Deitic movements - Point to a present object
**Kinetographs - Depict a bodily action
**Spatial movements - Depict a spacial relationship
**[[Pictogram|Pictographs]] - Draw a picture of their referent
**Rhythmic movements - Depict the rhythm or pacing of an event
*'''Affect Displays''' - Show emotion
*'''Regulators''' - Control the flow and pace of communication
*'''Manipulators''' - Release physical or emotional tension

Kinesic behaviors are an important part of [[nonverbal communication]]. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

A '''language survey''' is conducted around the world for a variety of reasons.

*measuring people's ability to speak and understand another language (usually community based, not school based) ([[multilingualism]])
*studying people's attitudes about different languages (Rensch 1993)
*evaluating the differences and similarities in speech of communities that speak related speech forms, noting comprehension or collecting details of linguistic form ([[dialectology]]) (Labov 1982, Backstrom 1992,  Egland 1978)
*assessing the vitality of languages that may be disappearing ([[language death]]) (Statistic Canada 1993, Ferreira and Holbrook 2002)
*doing initial descriptions of languages in areas that are linguistically undescribed (King and King 1984)

== Methods ==
Methods used in language surveys depend on the questions that the survey is trying to answer.  Methods used include collecting word lists (Bender 1971), playing recorded texts to assess comprehension (Casad 1974), sentence repetition tests (Radloff 1991), questionnaires (Hochstetler and Tillinghast 1996), group and individual interviews, retelling of stories (McKinnies and Priestly 2004), direct observation (Cooper and Carpenter 1976),  and even internet surveys (tafesilafai.org).

As with any form of [[research]], the methods used depend on the questions that the researchers are trying to answer.  Also, the reliability of the results varies according to the method and the rigor with which it is applied, proper sampling technique, etc.

== Applications ==
The results of language surveys are use for a variety of purposes.  One of the most common is in making decisions for implementing educational programs.  The results have also been used for making decision for language development work (Holbrook, 2001).  And of course, academics are always interested in the results of any language survey.

== Agencies ==
Surveys have also been conducted by ethnic associations (Saskatchewan 1991), government agencies (Statistics Canada 1993),  NGO's (Toba, et al. 2002), foundations ([[Pew Hispanic Center]] 2004), etc.  Often such groups work together (Clifton 2002).  Some large and notable surveys include the Language Survey of India which was begun by [[George Abraham Grierson]]  late in the 19th century ([[Sociolinguistics research in India]]) and the Survey of Language Use and Language Teaching in East Africa, sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]] from the 1960s.  Both resulted in a number of volumes describing locations of languages, patterns of multilingualism, language classification, and also included descriptions of languages, such as ''Language in Ethiopia'' ([[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Bender]], Bowen, Cooper, and [[Charles A. Ferguson|Ferguson]] 1976). The single agency conducting the most language surveys around the world is [[SIL International]] (Summer Institute of Linguistics).  The results of many of their surveys are posted on the web: http://www.sil.org/silesr.

== Sign languages ==
Surveys have usually been conducted among spoken languages.  However, surveys have also been done among users of [[sign language]]s (Vasishta, Woodward, and Wilson 1978,  Woodward 1991, 1993, 1996, Parkhurst &amp; Parkhurst 1998, Al-Fityani &amp; Padden 2008). As with surveys among spoken languages, surveys among sign languages have studied multilingualism, attitudes about various languages both spoken and signed (Ciupek-Reed 2012), differences and similarities between signed varieties (Aldersson and McEntee-Atalianis 2007, Bickford 1991, 2005, Parks 2011), and assessing the vitality of signed languages, and initial descriptions of undocumented sign languages.

Legal tests are often formulated from the logical analysis of a judicial decision or a court order where it appears that a [[finder of fact]] or the [[court]] made a particular decision after contemplating a well-defined set of circumstances. It is assumed that evaluating any given set of circumstances under a legal test will lead to an unambiguous and repeatable result. &lt;!-- this needs to be clarified --&gt;

Within the field of [[rhetoric]], the contributions of female rhetoricians have often been overlooked. Anthologies comprising the history of rhetoric or rhetoricians often leave the impression there were none. Throughout history, however, there have been a significant number of women rhetoricians.

''Re∙Vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival.'' -Adrienne Rich

The following is a timeline of contributions made to the field of rhetoric by women.

==Before Common Era==

*[[Aspasia]] (c. 410 BC) was a [[Miletus|Milesian]] woman who was known and highly regarded  for her teaching of political theory and rhetoric. She is mentioned in [[Plato]]'s [[Memexenus]], and is often credited with teaching the [[Socratic method]] to [[Socrates]].

*[[Diotima of Mantinea]] (4th century BC) is an important character in Plato's [[Symposium]]. It is uncertain if she was a real person or perhaps a character modelled after Aspasia, for whom Plato had much respect.

==14th century==

*[[Julian of Norwich]](1343-1415) was an English [[mysticism|mystic]] who challenged the teachings of [[medieval]] [[Christianity]] in regard to women's inferior role in religion.
:*[[Revelations of Divine Love]]

*[[Catherine of Siena]] (1347-1380) was an Italian who was influential through her writings to men and women in authority, where she begged for peace in [[Italy]] and for the return of the [[papacy]] to [[Rome]]. She was [[canonized]] in 1461 by [[Pope Pius II]].
:*"Letter 83: To Mona Lapa, her mother, in Siena" (1376)

*[[Christine de Pizan]] (1365-1430) was a [[Venice|Venetian]] who moved to France at an early age. She was influential as a writer, rhetorician and critic during the medieval period, and was Europe's first female professional author.
:*[[The Book of the City of Ladies]] (1404)

*[[Margery Kempe]] (1373-1439) was a British woman who could neither read nor write, but dictated her life story ''The Book of Margery Kempe''after receiving a vision of Christ during the birth of the first of her fourteen children. From the 15th century Kempe was viewed as a holy woman after her book was published in pamphlet form with any thought or behavior that could be viewed as nonconforming or unorthodox removed. When the original was rediscovered in 1934, a more complex self-portrait emerged.
:*''[[The Book of Margery Kempe]]'' (1436)

==15th century==

*[[Laura Cereta]] (1469-1499) was an Italian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] and [[feminist]] who was influential in the letters she wrote to other intellectuals.  Through her letters she fought for women's right to education and against the oppression of married women.
:*''Letter to Bibulus, Sempronius, Defense of the Liberal Instruction of Women" (1488)

==17th century==

*[[Margaret Fell]] (1614-1702) was a British founding member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], and was popularly known as the "mother of Quakerism". She was persecuted and imprisoned for speaking her mind. She is credited with many essential changes within the Quaker church which brought more freedom for women in religious, social, and political areas.
:*Women's Speaking Justified, Proved and Allowed by the Scriptures'' (1666)

*[[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle (c. 1623-1673) was a British novelist, playwright, philosopher, poet, and rhetorician. Recent critics—most notably Christine Sutherland and Jane Donawerth—have explored her rhetorical theory and practice. Key works in this vein include:
:*sections of ''The Worlds Olio'' (1655)
:*''Orations of Divers Sorts'' (1662)
:*''The Female Academy'' in ''Playes'' (1662)

*[[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651-1695) was a Mexican who entered a [[convent]] to dedicate her life to scholarship. She took part in the elite intellectual circles of her time, and many see her as the first feminist of the [[New World]]. She wrote poetry, essays, and religious treatises, and argued for a more [[holistic]] role for women in society.
:*''[[La Respuesta]]'' (1691)

*[[Mary Astell]] (1668-1731) is regarded by many as the first English feminist writer. In her anonymous publications, Astell vigorously supported equal education opportunities for women.

Her idea of gender equality rested upon the transcendental notion of the universal one, the fact that female and male form a whole and require one another.
:*''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1845)

*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860-1935) was a prominent American author, artist, lecturer, and feminist social reformer. She is best known for her short story ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'', which she based on her own experience with mental illness and misguided medical treatment.

*[[Sarah Moore Grimké|Sarah Grimke]] (1792-1873) was an American, who was influential in her work in the abolitionist movement during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and also for writings and lectures she made in support of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Since Grimke was prohibited from receiving formal education, she educated herself to become the oritor she had always wanted to be.  She also taught her personal slave to read even though it was against the law for her to do so. Grimke noted that fighting for abolition was as important as fighting for women's rights.

Stanton drafted a "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]" for the convention, in which she declares that men and women are created equal. She also proposed a resolution demanding the right to vote be extended to include women. That resolution was voted upon at the convention and carried. Stanton went on to write many important documents and speeches of the women's rights movement.

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5148">'''OTSEM''' (''Old Testament Studies: Epistemologies and Methods'') is a research network of several Northern European universities. Originally Nordic-German in nature, it now includes British universities as well, which gives it a Nordic-German-Anglo profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stenström|authorlink1=Unity and Diversity in Nordic Biblical Scholarship|editor1-last=Boer|editor1-first=Roland|title=The Future of the Biblical Past: Envisioning Biblical Studies on a Global Key|date=2012|publisher=SBL|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization focuses on research into the [[Hebrew Bible]] and promotes the development of young scholars in particular, especially through annual seminars and special lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Together at the OTSEM Meeting in Hamburg {{!}} Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions|url = http://blogs.helsinki.fi/sacredtexts/2014/09/17/learning-together-at-the-otsem-meeting-in-hamburg/|website = blogs.helsinki.fi|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though encompassing theological faculties and using the term [[Old Testament]], OTSEM is non-confessional, with members from Christian (both Protestant and Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, and secular backgrounds.

==Institutions==

Currently, OTSEM consists of sixteen institutions from eight different countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Institutions|url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/204017.html|website=OTSEM Research Network|publisher=University of Göttingen|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Denmark'': [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Aarhus University]]
* ''Estonia'': [[University of Tartu]] (affiliated through Helsinki)
* ''Finland'': [[University of Helsinki]], [[Åbo Akademi University]]
* ''Germany'': [[University of Göttingen]], [[University of Hamburg]]

* ''Norway'': [[University of Oslo]], [[MF Norwegian School of Theology]], Norwegian School of Mission and Theology
* ''Sweden'': [[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]]

==History==

The history of OTSEM divides into three distinct periods: Proto-OTSEM, OTSEM I, and OTSEM II (the present iteration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OTSEM History|url=http://www.otsem.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/about-otsem/otsem-history|website=OTSEM|publisher=University of Hamburg|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto-OTSEM===

OTSEM's antecedents reach back to the 1970s. At that time, Helsinki and Göttingen had a student and professor exchange between their theological faculties. Beginning in the 1990s, bi- and trilateral doctoral seminars took place among the various institutions that would later become members of OTSEM.

* 1994: Helsinki visited Hamburg (where current Göttingen affiliates previously were)
* 1995: Aarhus visited Hamburg
* 1996: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1997: Lund visited Hamburg
* 1998: Hamburg visited Lund
* 2000: Göttingen visited Lund
* 2001: Lund and Oslo visited MF 
* 2002: MF visited Göttingen
* 2003: Lund, Göttingen, and Oslo visited MF

In addition to arranging doctoral seminars, future members also organised professorial exchanges.

* 1995: Hamburg visited Aarhus
* 1998: Lund visited Aarhus
* 1999: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Aarhus visited Lund and MF; Lund visited MF
* 2000: Helsinki visited Göttingen; Göttingen visited Lund; Lund visited MF; MF visited Lund
* 2001: Lund visited MF; Helsinki visited MF

===OTSEM I===

From 2004 through 2008, the Nordic Council (''NordForsk'') co-funded the research network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordic Research Gems: Success stories from NORIA|date=2008|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|pages=26–27|url=http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A707825&amp;dswid=1563|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Granerød|first1=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|date=2010|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|page=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, OTSEM saw formalization and expansion. This expansion included an increase in not only the number of members and member institutions but also meetings and individual exchanges. In particular, the now formal organization commenced its annual conferences (Oslo in 2004, Göttingen in 2005, Aarhus in 2006, Helsinki in 2008, and Lund in 2008). With the end of funding from the Nordic Council came the end of OTSEM I and start of OTSEM II.

===OTSEM II===

Since 2009, OTSEM has been financed solely by its associated institutions. Nevertheless, the research network has continued its annual conference and individual exchanges.

==Notable members==

OTSEM members with a high international profile have included the following:

*[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]]
*Fredrik Lindström
*[[Reinhard Gregor Kratz]]
*[[Martti Nissinen]]
*[[Hermann Spieckermann]]
*Terje Stordalen

'''Optimot, linguistic inquiries''', is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute for Catalan Studies]] and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.

== History ==
Up to 2007, the Consortium for Linguistic Normalization, the TERMCAT Terminology Centre, the Institute of Catalan Studies, and the directorate-general of Linguistics Politics dealt with linguistic inqueries that came from general population, companies, organizations, and language professionals. In order to avoid decentralization of the linguistic enquiries and to offer a unified service, Optimot was implemented. The search engine started working in October 2007 and the personalized service began in February 2008. Mainly, Optimot was to improve quality in linguistic-inquiry service by unifying criteria, and to promote linguistic autonomy.

== Search sources ==
The sources used in the searches performed by Optimot are the following:&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.91021952ed2301e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ee8e44ce74aa3110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Optimot, consultes lingüístiques]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''overview''' in [[policy debate]] is part of a [[structure of policy debate|speech]] which is flagged as not responding to the line-by-line arguments on the [[flow (policy debate)|flow]]. An overview may be "global" if presented at the beginning of a speech or "local" if presented at the beginning of a position.

Overviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For instance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon Disadvantage would be an expected overview.

Debaters will usually inform the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] where they will be giving an overview before they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A small minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a debater starts giving this order.

Many judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round begins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long. However, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot be placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their importance.

The above is also informally known as a "road map"

Another form of an overview is of specifically in the section of the speech(i.e. [[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]], [[Kritik]], Disadvantage, Counter-Plan, etc). This is commonly announced before the debater's speech and will signpost an overview.

The overview usually consists of star/main arguments being made and more than likely tend to contain extended evidence or authors. This practice is used to elaborate an argument and/or bring it back up in order for the judge to be aware of the main arguments being made by a team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7888">A '''paraprosdokian''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ær|ə|p|r|ɒ|s|ˈ|d|oʊ|k|i|ə|n}}) is a [[figure of speech]] in which the latter part of a sentence, phrase, or larger discourse is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. It is frequently used for humorous or dramatic effect, sometimes producing an [[Climax (rhetoric)#Anticlimax|anticlimax]]. For this reason, it is extremely popular among comedians and satirists.&lt;ref name="glossary" /&gt; Some paraprosdokians not only change the meaning of an early phrase, but they also play on the [[double meaning]] of a particular word, creating a form of [[syllepsis]].

==Etymology==
"Paraprosdokian" comes from the Greek "[[wikt:παρά|παρά]]", meaning "against" and "[[wikt:προσδοκία|προσδοκία]]", meaning "expectation". The term "prosdokia" ("expectation") occurs with the preposition "para" in Greek rhetorical writers of the 1st century BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, with the meaning "contrary to expectation" or "unexpectedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Demetrius On Style, The Greek text of Demetrius De Elocutione |authorlink=Demetrius of Phalerum |author=Demetrius |editor=Roberts, W.

{{Wiktionary|philogyny}}

'''Philogyny''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[women]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|title=philogynist – The Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd edition revised) – Oxford Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philogyny|title=WordNet|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misogyny]]''. Philogyny is not be confused with [[gynephilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to women or [[femininity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[gynophobia]]'').

Cicero reports the word could be used in Greek philosophy to denote being overly fond of women, which was considered a disease along with misogyny.&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Groes-Green has argued that the conceptual content of philogyny must be developed as an alternative to the concept of misogyny. Criticizing [[R.W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Groes-Green, C. 2012. "Philogynous masculinities: Contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique". Men and Masculinities 15(2):91–111. http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/15/2/91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Philogyny'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''gynē'' (woman). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to men (males) are [[philandry]] for "fondness towards men" and [[misandry]] for "hatred of men". Parallel terms for humanity generally are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indo-European topics}}
{{PIE notice}}
'''Proto-Indo-European mythology''' is the body of myths and stories associated with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Although these stories are not directly attested, they have been reconstructed by scholars of [[comparative mythology]] based on the similarities in the belief systems of various Indo-European peoples.

Various schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European mythology, which do not always agree with each other. [[Vedic mythology]], [[Roman mythology]], and [[Norse mythology]] are the main mythologies normally used for comparative reconstruction, though they are often supplemented with supporting evidence from the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], and [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] traditions as well.

The Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes well-attested deities such as [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']], the god of the daylit skies, his daughter [[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']], the goddess of the dawn, the [[divine twins]], and the storm god [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']]. Other probable deities include ''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral god, and ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'', a female [[solar deity]].

Well-attested myths of the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth involving a [[storm god]] who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world. The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the [[Otherworld]] was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river. They also may have believed in a world tree, bearing fruit of immortality, either guarded by or gnawed on by a serpent or dragon, and tended by three goddesses who spun the thread of life.

==Methods of reconstruction==
===Schools of thought===


The mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans is not directly attested and it is difficult to match their language to archaeological findings related to any specific culture from the [[Chalcolithic]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=}} Nonetheless, scholars of comparative mythology have attempted to reconstruct aspects of Proto-Indo-European mythologies based on the existence of similarities among the [[Deity|deities]], religious practices, and myths of various Indo-European peoples. This method is known as the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]. Different schools of thought have approached the subject of Proto-Indo-European mythology from different angles. The Meteorological School holds that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around deified natural phenomena such as the [[sky]], the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the [[dawn]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428}} This meteorological interpretation was popular among early scholars, but has lost a considerable degree of scholarly support in recent years.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14-15}} The Ritual School, on the other hand, holds that Proto-Indo-European myths are best understood as stories invented to explain various rituals and religious practices.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} Bruce Lincoln, a member of the Ritual School, argues that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed that every sacrifice was a reenactment of the original sacrifice performed by the founder of the human race on his twin brother.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} The Functionalist School holds that Proto-Indo-European society and, consequently, their mythology, was largely centered around the [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional system]] proposed by [[Georges Dumézil]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}} which holds that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social classes: farmers, warriors, and priests.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}}&lt;ref&gt;''Mythe et Épopée I, II, III'', by G. Dumézil, Gallimard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=18}} The Structuralist School, by contrast, argues that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around the concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] opposition.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} This approach generally tends to focus on cultural universals within the realm of mythology, rather than the genetic origins of those myths,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but it also offers refinements of the Dumézilian trifunctional system by highlighting the oppositional elements present within each function, such as the creative and destructive elements both found within the role of the warrior.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

===Source mythologies===
[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|right|330px|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]]]

One of the earliest attested and thus most important of all Indo-European mythologies is [[Vedic mythology]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} especially the mythology of the [[Rigveda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]]. Early scholars of comparative mythology such as [[Max Müller]] stressed the importance of Vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}} Modern researchers have been much more cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}}

Another of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is [[Roman mythology]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}} Contrary to the frequent erroneous statement made by some authors that "Rome has no myth", the Romans possessed a very complex mythological system, parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic Roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=146–147}} Despite its relatively late attestation, [[Norse mythology]] is still considered one of the three most important of the Indo-European mythologies for comparative research,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} simply due to the vast bulk of surviving Icelandic material.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}}

[[Baltic mythology]] has also received a great deal of scholarly attention, but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=223–228}} Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=228–229}} Despite the popularity of [[Greek mythology]] in western culture,{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=126-127}} Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of [[Pre-Greek]] and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=138, 143}} Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the mid 2000s.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}

Although [[Scythians]] are considered relatively conservative in regards to Proto-Indo-European cultures, retaining a similar lifestyle and culture,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W. (2007). The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-05887-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scythian religion|their mythology]] has very rarely been examined in an Indo-European context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral Indo-European mythology. At least three deities, [[Tabiti]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]], are generally interpreted as having Indo-European origins,&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. Indo-European Poetry and Myth.

==Pantheon==
Linguists are able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) from many types of sources. Some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others.{{efn|In order to present a consistent notation, the reconstructed forms used here are cited from {{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006}}. For further explanation of the laryngeals – &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, and &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; – see the [[Laryngeal theory]] article.}}

The term for "a god" was ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/deywós|*deiwos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in Hittite, ''sius''; Latin, ''deus'', ''divus''; Sanskrit, ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]''; [[Avestan]], ''[[daeva]]'' (later, Persian, ''div''); Welsh, ''duw''; Irish, ''dia''; Old Norse, ''tívurr''; Lithuanian, ''[[Dievas]]''; Latvian, ''Dievs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European ''*Deiwos'' and Related Words'' by Grace Sturtevant Hopkins (''Language'' Dissertations published by the Linguistic Society of America, Number XII, December 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavenly deities===
====Sky Father====
{{main|Sky father}}
[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of [[Zeus]] on a gold [[stater]] from the Greek city of [[Lampsacus]], c 360–340 BC]]

The head deity of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']],{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}} whose name literally means "Sky Father".{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}}{{sfn|Winters|2003|pages=134–135}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} He is believed to have been regarded as the god of the daylit skies.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=166–168}} He is, by far, the most well-attested of all the Proto-Indo-European deities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}{{sfn|West|2007|page=166}} The Greek god [[Zeus]], the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Illyrian god Dei-Pátrous all appear as the head gods of their respective pantheons.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} The Norse god [[Týr]], however, seems to have been demoted to the role of a minor war-deity prior to the composition of the earliest Germanic texts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}} *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' is also attested in the [[Rigveda]] as [[Dyaus Pita|Dyáus Pitā]], a minor ancestor figure mentioned in only a few hymns.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409 and 431}} The names of the Latvian god [[Dievs]] and the Hittite god Attas Isanus do not preserve the exact literal translation of the name *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'',{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but do preserve the general meaning of it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

''*Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' may have had a consort who was an earth goddess.{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} This possibility is attested in the Vedic pairing of Dyáus Pitā and [[Prithvi|Prithvi Mater]],{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} the Roman pairing of Jupiter and [[Tellus Mater]] from [[Macrobius]]'s ''[[Saturnalia (Macrobius)|Saturnalia]]'',{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} and the Norse pairing of [[Odin]] and [[Jörð]]. Odin is not a reflex of *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'', but his cult may have subsumed aspects of an earlier chief deity who was.{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} This pairing may also be further attested in an Old English ploughing prayer{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} and in the Greek pairings of [[Ouranos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and Zeus and [[Demeter]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=181–183}}

====Dawn Goddess====

[[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410, 432}}{{sfn|West|2007|217-227}} Twenty-one hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to the dawn goddess [[Ushas|Uṣás]]{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} and a single passage from the Avesta honors the dawn goddess Ušå.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The dawn goddess [[Eos]] appears prominently in early Greek poetry and mythology.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Roman dawn goddess [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] is a reflection of the Greek Eos,{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} but the original Roman dawn goddess may have continued to be worshipped under the cultic title [[Mater Matuta]].{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Anglo-Saxons worshipped the goddess [[Ēostre]], who was associated with a festival in spring which later gave its name to a month, which gave its name to the Christian holiday of [[Easter]] in English.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The name ''Ôstarmânôth'' in [[Old High German]] has been taken as an indication that a similar goddess was also worshipped in southern Germany.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=217–218}} The Lithuanian dawn goddess [[Austrine|Aušra]] was still acknowledged in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|West|2007|page=218}} Uṣás in the Sanskrit tradition and Eos in the Greek have very similar attributes, indicating that these attributes were established by at least the Greco-Aryan period.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=218–224}} Both goddesses are also portrayed as taking mortal lovers.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=224–225}}

====Sun and Moon====
[[File:HittiteGoddessAndChildAnatolia15th-13thCenturyBCE.jpg|thumb|left|Possible depiction of the [[Sun goddess of Arinna|Hittite Sun goddess]] holding a child in her arms from between 1400 and 1200 BC]]

[[Sun deity|''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'']] and [[Moon deity|''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not'']] are reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the Sun and god of the Moon respectively. ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'' is reconstructed based on the Greek god [[Helios]], the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the Celtic goddess [[Sulis|Sul/Suil]], the North Germanic goddess [[Sól (Sun)|Sól]], the Continental Germanic goddess [[Sowilō|*Sowilō]], the Hittite goddess [[Sun goddess of Arinna|"UTU-liya"]],{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Hvare-khshaeta]]{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} and the Vedic god [[Surya]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=232}}

''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not-'' is reconstructed based on the Norse god [[Máni]], the Slavic god [[Jarilo|Myesyats]],{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} and the Lithuanian god *[[List of Lithuanian gods#Gods and god-like beings|Meno]], or Mėnuo (Mėnulis).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=385}} They are often seen as the twin children of various deities,&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web. Goddess of Light and Loom: Evidence for the Indo-European Origin of Two Ancient Chinese Deities" (PDF). Sino-Platonic Papers (118). ISSN 2157-9687. OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the sun and moon were deified several times and are often found in competing forms within the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web. Goddess of Light and Loom: Evidence for the Indo-European Origin of Two Ancient Chinese Deities" (PDF). Sino-Platonic Papers (118). ISSN 2157-9687. OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual scheme is that one of these celestial deities is male and the other female, though the exact gender of the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]] tends to vary among subsequent Indo-European mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web. Goddess of Light and Loom: Evidence for the Indo-European Origin of Two Ancient Chinese Deities" (PDF). Sino-Platonic Papers (118). ISSN 2157-9687.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; a characteristic not only supported by the higher number of sun goddesses in subsequent derivations (feminine Sól, Saule, [[Sulis]], Solntse—not directly attested as a goddess, but feminine in gender — [[Étaín]], Grían, [[Aimend]], [[Áine]], and Catha versus masculine Helios, Surya, [[Savitr]], [[Usil]], and Sol) ([[Hvare-khshaeta]] is of neutral gender),&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; but also by vestiges in mythologies with male solar deities (Usil in Etruscan art is depicted occasionally as a goddess, while solar characteristics in [[Athena]] and [[Helen of Troy]] still remain in Greek mythology).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web. Goddess of Light and Loom: Evidence for the Indo-European Origin of Two Ancient Chinese Deities" (PDF). Sino-Platonic Papers (118). ISSN 2157-9687.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; with feminine lunar deities like Selene, Minerva, and Luna being a development exclusive to the eastern Mediterranean. Even in these traditions, remnants of male lunar deities, like [[Menelaus]], remain.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web.

Although the sun was personified as an independent, female deity, the Proto-Indo-Europeans also visualized the sun as the eye of [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']], as seen in various reflexes: [[Helios]] as the eye of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Sick, David H. (2004), "Mit(h)ra(s) and the Myths of the Sun", Numen, 51 (4): 432–467, {{JSTOR|3270454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ljuba Merlina Bortolani, Magical Hymns from Roman Egypt: A Study of Greek and Egyptian Traditions of Divinity, Cambridge University Press, 13/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hvare-khshaeta]] as the eye of [[Ahura Mazda]], and the sun as "God's eye" in Romanian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, Doina; Dumitrache, Cristiana (2012), "The Sun Worship with the Romanians." (PDF), Romanian Astronomical Journal, 22 (2): 155–166&lt;/ref&gt; The names of Celtic sun goddesses like [[Sulis]] and [[Grian]] may also allude to this association; the words for "eye" and "sun" are switched in these languages, hence the name of the goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, James.

===Divine Twins===
====Horse Twins====
[[File:Dioskouroi Met L.2008.18.1-2 n03.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pair of Roman statuettes from the third century AD depicting the Dioscuri as horsemen, with their characteristic skullcaps ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York)]]

The [[Divine Twins|Horse Twins]] are a set of twin brothers found throughout nearly every Indo-European pantheon who usually have a name that means 'horse' ''*ekwa-'',{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} but the names are not always cognate and no Proto-Indo-European name for them can be reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} In most Indo-European pantheons, the Horse Twins are brothers of the Sun Maiden or Dawn goddess, and sons of the sky god.{{snf|West|2007|pages=185–191}}

They are reconstructed based on the Vedic [[Ashvins]], the Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], the Latvian [[Dieva deli]], the Greek [[Dioskouroi]] (Kastor and Polydeukes), the Roman [[Dioscuri]] (Castor and Pollux), and the Old English [[Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] (whose names mean "stallion" and "horse").{{sfn|West|2007|pages=186–191}} References from the Greek writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] indicate that the Celts may have had a set of horse twins as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=190}} The Welsh [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]] and [[Manawydan]] may also be related.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} The horse twins may have been based on the morning and evening star (the planet [[Venus]]) and they often have stories about them in which they "accompany" the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shapiro. ''Journal of Indo-European Studies'', 10&amp;thinsp;(1&amp;2), pp.&amp;nbsp;137–166; who references D. Ward (1968) "The Divine Twins". ''Folklore Studies'', No.&amp;nbsp;19. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twin Founders====
The Proto-Indo-European Creation myth seems to have involved two key figures: *''Manu-'' ("Man"; Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]; Germanic [[Mannus]]) and his twin brother *''Yemo-'' ("Twin"; Indic [[Yama]]; Germanic [[Ymir]]).{{sfn|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of these two figures usually fulfill the respective roles of founder of the human race and first human to die.{{snf|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{snf|Lincoln|1991|page=}}

===Storm deities===

[[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning and storms. His name literally means "The Striker." He is reconstructed based on the Norse goddess [[Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn|Fjǫrgyn]] (the mother of [[Thor]]), the Lithuanian god [[Perkūnas]], and the Slavic god [[Perun|Perúnú]]. The Vedic god [[Parjanya|Parjánya]] may also be related, but his possible connection to *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' is still under dispute.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410 and 433}} The name of *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' may also be attested in Greek as ''[[wikt:κεραυνός|κεραυνός]]'' (''Keraunós''), an epithet of the god [[Zeus]] meaning "thunder-shaker."{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=235}} A possible alternative name, through the root *(s)tenh₂, is responsible for [[Thor]] as well as Hittite [[Tarhunt]] and Celtic [[Taran]]/[[Taranis]]. The Roman god [[Mars]] is also a speculated descendent, since he originally had thunderer characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water deities===
Some authors have proposed ''*Neptonos'' or *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'' as the Proto-Indo-European god of the waters. The name literally means "Grandson [or ''Nephew''] of the Waters."{{refn|Dumézil, G., [Tr] Krapp, P. (1996). ''Archaic Roman Religion''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Translation from French by P. Krapp of &lt;ref name=Dumezil_1966&gt;Dumézil, G.(1966). ''La Religion romaine archaïque, avec un appendice sur la religion des Étrusques''. Payot.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} Philologists reconstruct his name from that of the Vedic god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]], the Roman god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]], and the Old Irish god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]]. Although such a god has been solidly reconstructed in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], Mallory and Adams nonetheless still reject him as a Proto-Indo-European deity on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}}

A river goddess *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/déh₂nu|Deh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;nu-]]'' has been proposed based on the Vedic goddess [[Danu (Asura)|Dānu]], the Irish goddess [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], the Welsh goddess Don and the names of the rivers [[Danube]], Don, Dnieper, and Dniester. Mallory and Adams, however, dismiss this reconstruction, commenting that it does not have any evidence to support it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

Some have also proposed the reconstruction of a sea god named *''Trih&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tōn'' based on the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the Old Irish word ''trïath'', meaning "sea." Mallory and Adams reject this reconstruction as having no basis, asserting that the "lexical correspondence is only just possible and with no evidence of a cognate sea god in Irish."{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral deity, is reconstructed based on the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the Vedic god [[Pushan|Pūshān]]. Both deities are closely affiliated with goats and were worshipped as pastoral deities.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The minor discrepancies between the two deities can be easily explained by the possibility that many attributes originally associated with Pan may have been transferred over to his father [[Hermes]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The association between Pan and Pūshān was first identified in 1924 by the German scholar [[Hermann Collitz]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Collitz, "Wodan, Hermes und Pushan," ''Festskrift tillägnad Hugo Pipping pȧ hans sextioȧrsdag den 5 November 1924'' 1924, pp 574–587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|Beekes, R. S.

In 1855, [[Adalbert Kuhn]] suggested that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in a set of helper deities, whom he reconstructed based on the Germanic [[elves]] and the Hindu [[ribhus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn1855-p110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Adalbert|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Die sprachvergleichung und die urgeschichte der indogermanischen völker|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=4|year=1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}, "Zu diesen ṛbhu, alba.. stellt sich nun aber entschieden das ahd. alp, ags. älf, altn . âlfr"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''[[Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|K.

It is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in [[Triple goddesses|three fate goddesses]] who [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] the destinies of mankind.{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–385}} Although such fate goddesses are not directly attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the [[Atharvaveda]] does contain an allusion comparing fate to a [[Warp and woof|warp]].{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} The earliest attested set of fate goddesses are the [[Gulses]] in Hittite mythology, who were said to preside over the individual destinies of human beings.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} They often appear in mythical narratives alongside the goddesses Papaya and Istustaya,{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} who, in a ritual text for the foundation of a new temple, are described sitting holding mirrors and spindles, spinning the king's thread of life.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} In the Greek tradition, the [[Moirai]] ("Apportioners") are mentioned dispensing destiny in both the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', in which they are given the epithet Κλῶθες (''Klothes'', meaning "Spinners").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 20.127, 24.209; ''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.197&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–381}} In Hesiod's ''Theogony'', the Moirai are said to "give mortal men both good and ill" and their names are listed as [[Clotho|Klotho]] ("Spinner"), [[Lachesis]] ("Apportioner"), and [[Atropos]] ("Inflexible").&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', lines 904–906&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] records that Klotho sings of the past, Lachesis of the present, and Atropos of the future.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} In Roman legend, the [[Parcae]] were three goddesses who presided over the births of children and whose names were Nona ("Ninth"), Decuma ("Tenth"), and Morta ("Death").{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} They too were said to spin destinies, although this may have been due to influence from Greek literature.{{snf|West|2007|page=381}}

In the Old Norse ''[[Völuspá]]'' and ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the [[Norns]] are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of [[Urðr]] at the foot of the world tree [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Völuspá]]'' 20; ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' 15&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=382}}{{efn|The names of the individual Norns are given as [[Urðr]] ("Happened"), [[Verðandi]] ("Happening"), and [[Skuld]] ("Due"),{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} but M. L. West notes that these names may be the result of classical influence from Plato.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} In Old Norse texts, the Norns are frequently conflated with [[Valkyrie]]s, who are sometimes also described as spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=382}} Old English texts, such as ''[[The Rhyming Poem|Rhyme Poem]]'' 70, and ''[[Guthlac of Crowland|Guthlac]]'' 1350 f., reference [[Wyrd]] as a singular power that "weaves" destinies.{{snf|West|2007|pages=382–383}} Later texts mention the Wyrds as a group, with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] referring to them as "the Werdys that we clepyn Destiné" in ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''The Legend of Good Women, Hypermnestra'' 19&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}{{efn|They also, most famously, appear as the [[Three Witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' ({{circa}} 1606).{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} A goddess spinning appears in a [[bracteate]] from southwest Germany{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} and a relief from [[Trier]] shows three mother goddesses, with two of them holding distaffs.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} Tenth-century German ecclesiastical writings denounce the popular belief in three sisters who determined the course of a man's life at his birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} A Lithuanian folktale recorded in 1839 recounts that a man's fate is spun at his birth by seven goddesses known as the ''[[Deives Valdytojos|deivės valdytojos]]'' and used to hang a star in the sky;{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} when he dies, his thread snaps and his star falls as a meteor.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} In Latvian folk songs, a goddess called the [[Laima|Láima]] is described as weaving a child's fate at its birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} Although she is usually only one goddess, the Láima sometimes appears as three.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} The three spinning fate goddesses appear in Slavic traditions in the forms of the Russian Rožanicy, the Czech Sudičky, the Bulgarian Narenčnice or Urisnice, the Polish Rodzanice, the Croatian Rodjenice, the Serbian [[Sudjenice]], and the Slovene Rojenice.{{snf|West|2007|pages=384–385}} Albanian folk tales speak of the [[Fatit]], three old women who appear three days after a child is born and determine its fate, using language reminiscent of spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=385}}

[[Image:Franks Casket vorne links.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Depiction of [[Wayland the Smith]] from the [[Franks Casket]], dating to the eighth century AD]]

Although the name of a particular Proto-Indo-European smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} it is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had a smith deity of some kind, since smith gods occur in nearly every Indo-European culture, with examples including the Hittite god Hasammili, the Vedic god [[Tvastr]], the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], the Germanic villain [[Wayland the Smith]], and the Ossetian culture figure [[Kurdalagon]].{{snf|West|2009|154–157}} Many of these smith figures share certain characteristics in common. Hephaestus, the Greek god of blacksmiths, and Wayland the Smith, a nefarious blacksmith from Germanic mythology, are both described as lame.{{snf|West|2009|page=}} Additionally, Wayland the Smith and the Greek mythical inventor [[Daedalus]] both escape imprisonment on an island by fashioning sets of mechanical wings from feathers and wax and using them to fly away.{{snf|West|2009|page=155}}

The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have had a goddess who presided over the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional]] organization of society. Various epithets of the Iranian goddess [[Anahita]] and the Roman goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] provide sufficient evidence to solidly attest that she was probably worshipped, but no specific name for her can be lexically reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|page=433}} Vague remnants of this goddess may also be preserved in the Greek goddess [[Athena]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=133–134}}

Some scholars have proposed a war god *''Māwort-'' based on the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the Vedic [[Maruts|Marutás]], companions of the war-god [[Indra]]. Mallory and Adams, however, reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410–411}} Likewise, some researchers have found it more plausible that Mars was originally a storm deity, while this cannot be said for Ares.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dragon or serpent===

[[Image:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations082 kopie1jpg.jpg|thumb|right|450px|The Hittite god [[Tarhunt]], followed by his son [[Sarruma]], kills the dragon [[Illuyanka]] (Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, [[Ankara, Turkey]])]]

One common myth found in nearly all Indo-European mythologies is a battle ending with a [[hero]] or [[gods|god]] slaying a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[Dragon#Comparative mythology|dragon]] of some sort.{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=297–301}}{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=436–437}} Although the details of story often vary widely,{{sfn|West|2007|page=255}} in all iterations, several features remain remarkably the same.{{sfn|West|2007|page=255}} In iterations of the story, the serpent is usually associated with water in some way.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–256}} The hero of the story is usually a [[weather god|thunder-god]] or a hero who is somehow associated with thunder.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}} The serpent is usually multi-headed, or else "multiple" in some other way.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=436–437}}{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}

In [[Hittite mythology]], the storm god [[Tarhunt]] slays the giant serpent [[Illuyanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Philo Hendrik Jan Houwink Ten Cate: ''The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera During the Hellenistic Period''. E. J. Brill, Leiden 1961, pp. 203–220.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]], the god [[Indra]] slays the multi-headed serpent [[Vritra]], which had been causing a drought.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–257}} In the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', [[Krishna]] slays the serpent [[Kāliyā]].

[[File:Fragmentary jar with scene of Herakles slaying the Hydra of Lerna, South Italy, 375-340 BC, ceramic - Fitchburg Art Museum - DSC08671.JPG|thumb|left|Greek red-figure vase painting depicting [[Heracles]] slaying the [[Lernaean Hydra]], c. 375–340 BC]]

Several variations of the story are also found in [[Greek mythology]] as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=460}} The story is attested in the legend of [[Zeus]] slaying the hundred-headed [[Typhon]] from [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=448–460}} but it is also in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]] by [[Heracles]] and the slaying of [[Python (mythology)|Python]] by [[Apollo]].{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=460–464}} The story of [[Heracles]]'s theft of the cattle of [[Geryon]] is probably also related.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}} Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=374–383}}

The original Proto-Indo-European myth is also reflected in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]].{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=414–441}} In [[Norse mythology]], [[Thor]], the god of thunder, slays the giant serpent [[Jörmungandr]], which lived in the waters surrounding the realm of [[Midgard]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=429–441}} Other dragon-slaying myths are also found in the Germanic tradition. In the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', [[Sigurd]] slays the dragon [[Fafnir]] and, in ''[[Beowulf]]'', the eponymous hero slays [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|a different dragon]].

Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth are found throughout other branches of the language family as well. In [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Persian mythology]], [[Fereydun]], and later [[Garshasp]], slays [[Zahhak]]. In [[Slavic mythology]], [[Perun]], the god of storms, slays [[Veles (god)|Veles]] and [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] slays the three-headed dragon [[Zmey]]. In [[Armenian mythology]], the god [[Vahagn]] slays the dragon [[Vishap]].{{sfn|Kurkjian|1958|p=}} In [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]], [[Făt-Frumos]] slays the fire-spitting monster [[Zmeu]]. In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Dian Cecht]] slays Meichi. The myth is believed to have symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos.{{snf|Watkins|1995|pages=299–300}} In every version of the story, the dragon or serpent always loses, although in some mythologies, such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Ragnarök]] myth, the hero or god dies as well.{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=324–330}}

===Twin founders===
The analysis of different Indo-European tales indicates that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: *''{{PIE|Manu-}}'' ("Man") and *''{{PIE|Yemo-}}'' ("Twin"), his twin brother. A reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by [[David W. Anthony]], attributed in part to [[Bruce Lincoln]]:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Manu and Yemo traverse the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow, and finally decide to create the world. To do so, Manu sacrifices either Yemo or the cow, and with help from the sky father, the storm god and the divine twins, forges the earth from the remains. Manu thus becomes the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice. The sky gods then present cattle to the third man, *''{{PIE|Trito}}'', who loses it to the three-headed [[#Dragon or Serpent|serpent]] *''{{PIE|Ng&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;hi}}'', but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father. Trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of *Manu include Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], Germanic [[Mannus]]; of Yemo, Indic [[Yama]], Avestan [[Jamshid|Yima]], Norse [[Ymir]], possibly Roman [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] (&lt; earlier [[Old Latin]] ''*Yemos'').{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}}

[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]

The early "history" of Rome is widely recognized as a historicized retelling of various old myths.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=144–165}} [[Romulus and Remus]] are twin brothers from Roman mythology who both have stories in which they are killed.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–287}} The Roman writer Livy reports that Remus was believed to have been killed by his brother Romulus at the founding of Rome when they entered into a disagreement about which hill to build the city on. Later, Romulus himself is said to have been torn limb-from-limb by a group of senators.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}{{efn|One of the original sources for the stories of Romulus and Remus is Livy's ''History of Rome'', vol. 1, parts iv–vii and xvi. This has been published in an Everyman edition, translated by W. M. Roberts, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York 1912.}} Both of these myths are widely recognized as historicized remnants of the Proto-Indo-European creation story.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}

The Germanic languages have information about both Ymir and Mannus (reflexes of ''*Yemo-'' and ''*Manu-'' respectively),{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} but they never appear together in the same myth.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} Instead, they only occur in myths widely separated by both time and circumstances.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} In chapter two of his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', which was written in Latin in around 98 A.D., the Roman writer [[Tacitus]] claims that Mannus, the son of Tuisto, was the ancestor of the Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} This name never recurs anywhere in later Germanic literature,{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}} but one proposed meaning of the continental Germanic tribal name ''[[Alamanni]]'' is "[[Mannus]]' own people" ("all-men" being another scholarly etymology).{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}}

===Fire in water===
Another important possible myth is the myth of the fire in the waters, a myth which centers around the possible deity *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'', a fiery deity who dwells in water.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–283}} In the Rigveda, the god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]] is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters.{{sfn|West|2007|p=270}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–279}} In [[Celtic mythology]], a well belonging to the god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]] is said to blind all those who gaze into it.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=279}} In an old Armenian poem, a small reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero [[Vahagn]] springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} In a ninth-century Norwegian poem by the poet Thiodolf, the name ''sǣvar niþr'', meaning "grandson of the sea," is used as a [[kenning]] for fire.{{sfn|West|2007|p=272}} Even the Greek tradition contains possible allusions to the myth of a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} The phrase "''νέποδες καλῆς Ἁλοσύδνης''," meaning "descendants of the beautiful seas," is used in ''[[The Odyssey]]'' 4.404 as an epithet for the seals of [[Proteus]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}}

===Binding of evil===
Jaan Puhvel notes similarities between the Norse myth in which the god [[Týr]] inserts his hand into the wolf [[Fenrir]]'s mouth while the other gods bind him with [[Gleipnir]], only for Fenrir to bite off Týr's hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings,{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=199}} and the Iranian myth in which [[Jamshid]] rescues his brother's corpse from [[Ahriman]]'s bowels by reaching his hand up Ahriman's anus and pulling out his brother's corpse, only for his hand to become infected with [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the being's orifice (in Fenrir's case the mouth, in Ahriman's the anus) and losing it.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and are unlikely to be remnants of a Proto-Indo-European "evil god";{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=119–120}} nonetheless, it is clear that the "binding myth" is of Proto-Indo-European origin.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=120}}

==Cosmogony==

In the [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic myths]] of many Indo-European cultures a [[World egg | Cosmic Egg]] symbolizes the primordial state from which the universe arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David Adams |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Book 1 |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=world+egg+indo+european#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20egg%20indo%20european&amp;f=false|isbn=9781598841749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
===Underworld===

{{Main|Otherworld}}

Most Indo-European traditions contain some kind of [[Underworld]] or [[Afterlife]]. It is possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that, in order to reach the Underworld, one needed to cross a river, guided by an old man (''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵérh₂onts|*ĝerh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;ont-]]'').{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The Greek tradition of the dead being ferried across the river [[Styx]] by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] is probably a reflex of this belief.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The idea of crossing a river to reach the Underworld is also present throughout Celtic mythologies.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} Several Vedic texts contain references to crossing a river in order to reach the land of the dead and the Latin word ''tarentum'' meaning "tomb" originally meant "crossing point."{{snf|West|2007| page=389}} In Norse mythology, Hermóðr must cross a bridge over the river Giöll in order to reach [[Hel (being)|Hel]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=390–391}} In Latvian folk songs, the dead must cross a marsh rather than a river.{{snf|West|2007|page=391}} Traditions of placing coins on the bodies of the deceased in order to pay the ferryman are attested in both ancient Greek and early modern Slavic funerary practices.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} It is also possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the Underworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog, similar to the Greek [[Cerberus]], the Hindu Śárvara, or the Norse [[Garmr]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}}{{snf|West|2007|page=392}}

===World tree and serpent===
The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in some kind of world tree.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Norse mythology, the cosmic tree [[Yggdrasil]] is tended by the three [[Norns]] while the dragon [[Nidhogg]] gnaws at its roots.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three [[Hesperides]] and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=346–347}} In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, a malicious lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}}

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Romance studies''' is an academic discipline that covers the study of the languages, literatures, and cultures of areas that speak a [[Romance languages|Romance language]].  Romance studies departments usually include the study of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  Additional languages of study include [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], on one hand, and culture, history, and politics on the other hand.

Because most places in [[Latin America]] speak a Romance language, Latin America is also studied in Romance studies departments.  As a result, non-Romance languages in use in Latin America, such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], are sometimes also taught in Romance studies departments.

Romance studies departments differ from single- or two-language departments in that they attempt to break down the barriers in scholarship among the various languages, through interdisciplinary or comparative work.  These departments differ from Romance ''language'' departments in that they place a heavier emphasis on connections between language and literature, among others.

{{Disability}}
The '''Society for Disability Studies''' is an international academic network of [[disability studies]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/about |title=About SDS - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often abbreviates its name to '''SDS''', though that abbreviation continues to be used by academics and [[political scientists]] to describe the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] organization in the [[United States]]. The society's overall goal is to promote disability studies as a serious [[academic discipline]] on par with [[philosophy]], the [[social sciences]], and similar fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html |first=Cecilia Capuzzi |last=Simon |title=Disability Studies: A New Normal |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2013-11-03 |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of disability studies==
In 1993 the society adopted an official definition of "Disability Studies":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... examines the policies and practices of all societies to understand the social, rather than the physical or psychological determinants of the experience of disability. Disability Studies has been developed to disentangle impairments from the myths, ideology and stigma that influence social interaction and social policy. The scholarship challenges the idea that the economic and social statuses and the assigned roles of people with disabilities are the inevitable outcomes of their condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crds.org/about/index.shtml|title=Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies - University of Calgary|publisher=crds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Founding and history ==
The organization was founded in 1982 first as the '''Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability''' (SSCIID), and renamed '''Society for Disability Studies''' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founders are Daryl Evans, Nora Groce, Steve Hey, Gary Kiger, John Seidel, Jessica Scheer and Irving Kenneth Zola (1935-1994).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mission &amp; History {{!}} Society for Disability Studies|url = http://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website = www.disstudies.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Disability Studies is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

The Society maintains affiliation status with the Western Social Science Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wssaweb.com&lt;/ref&gt; (WSSA) through its Chronic Disease and Disability section. Currently, the SDS has hundreds of members both nationally and internationally who continue to make disability studies a part of academic conversations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Activities and publications==
The Society for Disability Studies holds an annual conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disstudies.org/annual-conference |title=Annual Conference - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org |date=2008-06-21|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June and publishes a quarterly peer-reviewed journal, the ''Disability Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dsq-sds.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/ |title=Disability Studies Quarterly|publisher=dsq-sds.org|accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is published exclusively online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org|title=Disability Studies Quarterly - Society for Disability Studies|publisher=disstudies.org|accessdate= 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDS has created a good model to follow when approaching publishers about their accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.disstudies.org/Publishing%20Accessible%20Books|title = Publishing Accessible Books|date = |access-date = 2016-02-16|website = Society for Disabilities|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adam Newman organized the "Digital Access Facilitation Team" (DAFT)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success&lt;/ref&gt; to make the 2015 annual conference of the Society for Disability Studies more accessible for a wider range of attendees. DAFT is coordinated by the Society's Student Caucus, whose members are a group of 25-30 students of SDS. Working in teams of two, members of DAFT were live-tweeting every session, contingent upon the consent of presenters. Live-tweeting all sessions and following standards for that emerging media, allowed a new way of producing accessibility for the disability community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digital Access Facilitation Team - SDS 2015 {{!}} Adam Newman's Fundraiser|url = http://www.crowdrise.com/DigitalAccessFacilitationTeam-SDS2015/fundraiser/adamnewman1/1/return/success/success|website = Crowdrise|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Society for Disability Studies, there are a number of caucuses which “designate groups that are under-represented within society or SDS as an organization.” DAFT is composed entirely of students (undergraduate, graduate, professional) who work on behalf of the interest and needs of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDS Student Caucus|url = http://sdsstudentcaucus.wordpress.com|website = SDS Student Caucus|access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)==

===Article 4 paragraph 1,CEDAW===
The CEDAW or the Convention,   also known as the international Bill of Women's Rights,  is a legally binding  [[international treaty]]  ratified by 187 States Parties, that entered into force in 1981.&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women :Adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by General Assembly resolution 34/180 of 18 December 1979. Entry into force 3 September 1981, in accordance with article 27(1)|date=18 December 1979|pages=10|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cedaw.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2014|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All  parties to  CEDAW, including the UN,  are bound to honor it.  The  UN Doctrine of  Gender Equality, and 'Special Measures for Gender Equality' are  inspired by  and rooted in the  CEDAW, specifically in  Article 4 paragraph 1, which states:

''Article 4, paragraph 1 : Adoption by States Parties of '''temporary special measures''' aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved. [emphasis added].''&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

===General Recommendation No. 25, on Article 4, paragraph 1  of CEDAW ===
The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), an expert body composed of 23 experts on women's issues established in 1982 to monitor the progress of the CEDAW's implementation,  in 2004,  adopted    ''General Recommendation 25, on Temporary Special Measures, on Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=UN|title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women Thirtieth session (12–30 January 2004) Thirty-first session (6-23 July 2004)|date=2004|volume=General Assembly Official Records Fifty-ninth Session Supplement No. 38 (A/59/38)|issue=A/59/38|pages=Annexure1 78–86|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/462/77/PDF/N0446277.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=2 February 2015|publisher=UN|location=New York|issn=0255-0970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general recommendation 'clarifies the nature and meaning of article 4, paragraph 1, in order to  facilitate and ensure the implementation of Temporary special measures   and  accelerate  progress in achieving gender equality in 'employment and professional fields'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)"/&gt;

The purpose of the "special measures", which are 'temporary' is " to accelerate the improvement of the position of women to achieve their  "substantive equality with men, and to effect the structural, social and cultural changes necessary to correct past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women, as well as to provide them with compensation."   These      are   not   an exception 'to the norm of non-discrimination', but rather 'part of a necessary strategy'   to  achieve 'substantive equality of women'.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 18}} The  'temporary special measures',   includes ''''preferential treatment; targeted recruitment, hiring and promotion; numerical goals connected with time frames; and quota systems''''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 22}}

=== UN and Article 4, paragraph 1 on Special Measures ===
The UN  Committee on CEDAW in its general recommendations number 25  commended the  Secretary General on his  initiative to   implement 'temporary special measures', noting  ''"The use of temporary special measures by the Secretary-General of the United  Nations is a practical example in the area of women's employment, including through  administrative instructions on  the recruitment, promotion and placement of women in the  Secretariat. These measures aim at achieving the goal of 50/50 gender distribution at all  levels, but at the higher  echelons in particular"''.&lt;ref name="(A/59/38)" /&gt;{{rp|note 3}}

In 2012, the UN  Secretary General drawing attention to   Article 4  paragraph 1 of the  ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]''  assured the  [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]  that Special Measures were temporary,  and   will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time".&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;

==Gender inequality in the UN==
Gender equality in the United Nations (UN),  particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above level, has been a United Nations General Assembly goal since 1970 and a recurring concern since then.&lt;ref name="women, 15 December 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 1930 Plenary Meeting|first1=United Nations|title=Employment of Qualified Women in Senior and other professional positions by the secretariats of Organisations in the United Nations system|journal=General assembly Resolution|date=15 December 1970|volume=2715 (XXV)|page=31|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/349/80/IMG/NR034980.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly, 72nd plenary meeting|title=Personnel questions : C Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=21 December 1990|volume=A/RES/45/239|issue=|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r239.htm|publisher=United Nations|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the [[Un secretariat|UN Secretariat]],  in order to better focus efforts to wards achieving Gender Equality, prepared its first five-year "Action plan to improve the status of women for the period 1985-90".&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;&lt;ref name="40/258. 18 December 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|first1=United Nations|title=Improvement of Status of women in the Secretariat|date=18 December 1985|volume=40/258 B|url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1985/349.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then there have been several Five Year Plans, including Strategic Plans, to Improve the Status of Women in the UN.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;  In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly after years of slow progress, urged the Secretary General to "accord priority" to increase "the participation of women at the D-1 level and above to 25 per cent " by 1995.&lt;ref name="A/RES/45/239"/&gt;
In December 1994,  the UN General Assembly "disappointment" that the targets set in 1990 were  not achieved  and that  women in posts at the D-1 level  were  "still well below the 25 per cent goal", urged the Secretary General to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.&lt;ref name="ST/SGB/282"/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title= Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat|date=23 December 1994|volume=A/RES/49/167|issue=94th plenarymeeting|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r167.htm|accessdate=11 December 2014|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Feb 2004, in the context of the continuing sluggish progress in achieving the target of gender parity the General Assembly revised the target for achieving 50/50 goal to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=58/144.

===Representation of women in decision-making positions===
Women's representation in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent.&lt;ref name="A /65/334"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=General Assembly|title=Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system Report of the Secretary-General|journal=GA Resolution|date=9 September 2010|issue=A /65/334|page=|pages=54|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/500/50/PDF/N1050050.pdf?OpenElement|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 29, Table 19}}  By   2009, the representation of women in the  secretariat  at D1 level  decreased to 26.7 percent; by way comparison  the representation in the entire UN system in  2009 was 29.2 percent.&lt;ref name="A /65/334" /&gt;{{rp| p 29, Table 19}}

The representation of women in 2011  in the secretariat at D2 level  was 24.4 percent.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 17}} In   December 2011, the representation of women in the Secretariat  at the D1 level  was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 50, fn 64}} At the current rate of  progress,  according to the secretary general's report,  gender parity  at  the D-1 to  higher levels   will be achieved after  102 years.&lt;ref name="A /67/347" /&gt;{{rp|paragraph 133}}

===Reasons for continuing  Gender Equality===
Reasons  most frequently cited for failure to meet the General Assembly targets   for  Gender Equality,   and slide in   women's representation  at the D1 and above level,   according to the Secretary General, are:  [a]  failure by some "entities"   in the "implementation of special measures for gender equality",  and [b]  tardy implementation of five year Actions Plans [para 143].&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A /65/334"/&gt;{{rp|Table 19, p 29}} In  2010-2011 only two out of thirty departments  in the UN  applied the "target of gender parity"[A/67/347,  p 46, paragraph 110(b)]. The  [[UN Secretariat]], the largest entity in the United Nations system, in which 38.7 percent of the staff is women, according to the report, claimed to be one of them. .&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|paragraph p 46, Para B 3(b }}

==Special measures for the achievement of gender equality==
The Special Measures in ST/AI/1999/9, which has four sections, apply throughout the Secretariat "for the filling of all vacant posts in the Professional category and above", including temporary posts.&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;{{rp|Section 1 and 2}}  Sections 1.6 and 1.8   of the ST/AI makes clear  that special measures "shall apply to the selection of staff for posts in all categories where '''women are under-represented'''".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|Section 1.9}}

===Goal===
The Goal of the ''Special Measures'' as set by the General Assembly  is to  achieve a 50/50 gender  distribution in  the entire organization  and all departments, and  in all "posts in the professional category and above,  including posts at the D1 level and above.  This goal applies throughout the Organization, and in every department, office or regional commission, overall and at each level. It applies not only to posts subject to geographical distribution but to all categories of posts, irrespective of the type or duration of the appointment ..., the series of the Staff Rules under which the appointment is to be given ... or the source of funding. ..."&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|section1.1}}&lt;ref name="Gender related  system policies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote= ST/AI/1999/9 will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cumulative seniority===
Section 1.6 of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates that "Cumulative seniority shall be taken into account when considering women candidates for promotion, except when it would adversely affect their situation. Cumulative seniority shall be calculated as the average of the years of the staff member accrued in her present Professional grade and in her immediately preceding Professional grade".&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

===Selection appointment ===
Section 1.8  of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates "Vacancies in the Professional category and above '''shall''' be filled, when there are one or more women candidates, by one of those candidates" when "Her qualifications meet the requirements for the vacant post";  and "her qualifications are '''substantially equal''' (emphasis added) or superior to those of competing male candidates" (Section 1.8 (i)(ii)).&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1"/&gt;

==Implementation and Monitoring==
Head of Departments(HODs) of UN entities  are responsible, and accountable, for the implementation of the special measures, and  the  Office of Human Resources(OHRM), under the Department of  Management (DM),  is  responsible  for monitoring the implementation of the  special measures .&lt;ref name="ST /AI/1999/9-1" /&gt;{{rp|Sections 4.1 and 4.5}}Steering Committee for the Improvement of the Status of Women in the Secretariat (ST/SGB/1999/9),  is responsible  for monitoring and implementation of policies of gender equality, including ''Special Measures''.&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chief, Policy and Conditions of Service Section, Office of Human Resources Management|title=United Nations Index to administrative issuances: ST/IC/2014/1*|date=January 2014|publisher=United Nations|location=NY, USA|isbn=|pages=2/70|edition= 2014: Reissued for technical reasons on 22 May 2014.|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=%20ST/IC/2014/1|chapter=Introduction|quote=The  Annual  Index to administrative issuances lists in alphanumeric order by series symbol, all issuances at United Nations Headquarters that were current as at 31 December 2013.

==Status of Special Measures on gender equality ==

===Special Measures  for 'Appointments, Placement and Promotion'===
The current Policies for ' appointments, placement and promotion' to obtain gender equality in the United Nations system are outlined  in ST/SGB/282 (Policies to achieve Gender Equality in the United nations),&lt;ref name="ST/SGB/282"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN SECRETARY-GENERAL|title=POLICIES TO ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE UNITED NATIONS, ST/SGB/282|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/n9600282.pdf|publisher=Secretariat|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=5 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ST/AI/1999/9(Special measures for Achievement of gender  Equality), which  entered into force on 1 October 1999. Gender Equality A/I is listed under the heading 'Appointments, placement and promotion" in  the Index  to  Administrative Issuance in effect as on 31 December 2013.

The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN-Women,  the United Nations entity responsible  for 'gender equality',  and  holding  "the UN system accountable for its own commitments on gender equality"  has  also promulgated that  the Gender Parity A/I  will "remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made".&lt;ref name="Gender related system policies2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=U N Women|title=Gender related United Nations system policies|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/fpgenderpolicies.htm#SPECIALMEASURES|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=20 December 2014|quote=II.  will remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made. The special measures governing the selection and placement of women candidates apply for the filing of all vacant posts at the Professional level in every department and office that has not met the goal of 50/50 gender distribution overall and at each grade level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretary General Report on  Special Measures==
Special Measures have found regular affirmation by the Secretary General  in his reports to the General Assembly. In 2011, Secretary-General's Policy Committee, of which all heads of departments (HOD) are members, including HOD of management,   decided    on "specific actions"   to "accelerate progress towards the goal  of gender parity".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;  An important  measure identified for action was  measures  for more effective implementations of  Special Measures. The Secretary General in  the  "Report of the  Secretary General" to the General Assembly, in September 2012, to accelerate the goal of gender parity, affirmed the following:&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;
* Special measures, include "targeted recruitment and promotion"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp| p33, para 68}}
* Temporary special measures, paraphrasing section 1.8 of ST/AI 1999/9, "should be effectively utilized for the placement of women candidates who are '''equally or substantially better qualified''' and should be introduced or restored in entities and at levels where progress is slow".&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, para 143(b}}   
* Special measures "include mandatory selection of equally or better qualified women candidates, mandatory inclusion of women candidates on all shortlists, and justification in cases where they have not been included or where the shortlisted women are not selected despite prevailing imbalance at that level"&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}}
* Special measures, in ST/AI 1999/9 to be revised and strengthened, to ensure effective implementation&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 45, para 108}} 
* Senior officials to ensure "effective implementation of special measures for gender equality."&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 55, paragraph 147 (b)}} 
* Special Measures are temporary and will "be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time";&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|para 67}}
* In the context of the legal challenges to Special Measures in the United Nations, and hesitant implementation by some UN entities, the Secretary General  drew attention to the judgment by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, in November 1994,  and   reiterated that "special measures are fully compatible with the objectives of Article 8 of the Charter of the United Nations".&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 34 paragraph 72}}

==New staff selection system  and Gender Equality A/I==
{{Main|United Nations Staff Selection System}}
The [[United Nations Secretariat]], in  April  2010,   superseded   the  old  Staff selection  system (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1) with a new  [[United Nations Staff Selection System|staff selection system (ST/AI 2010/3)]].&lt;ref name="2010/3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN Secretariat|title=Administrative instruction  Staff selection system, ST /AI/2010/3|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/324/85/PDF/N1032485.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=UN Secretariat|accessdate=6 April 2015|page=1|date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p2, preamble}}&lt;ref name="2010/3"/&gt;{{rp|p17, section 13.2}}  The new Staff selection system  was  listed in 2014 with   Gender Affirmative A/I ((ST/AI 1999/9))  as applicable  law for '''Appointments, placement and promotion'''.&lt;ref name="ST/IC/2014/1*"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2ST /AI/1999/9-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=ST /AI/1999/9.

The 'final provision' of the new staffing system which  entered into force on 22 April 2010  in section 13.3  notes that "The provisions of the present administrative instruction shall prevail over any inconsistent provisions contained in other administrative instructions and information circulars currently in force"&lt;ref name="2010/3"/&gt;{{rp|p17, section 13.3}}   There was a similar  provision in the  earlier Administrative instruction  Staff selection system (ST /AI/2006/3) as well.&lt;ref name="ST /AI/2006/3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Secretariat|title=Administrative instruction  Staff selection system (ST /AI/2006/3)|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/621/31/PDF/N0662131.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=UN Secretariat|accessdate=18 May 2015|date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p14, section 13.3}}  The UN Secretariat since 2010,  citing section 13.3 of the  new  Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3),   has,  some times,  contended that provision of section 13.3  supersede  Gender Equality A/I(ST/AI 1999/9),  especially section 1.8 on affirmative action, as  Gender A/I is inconsistent with 2010/3.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 33, paragraph 69}} [[UN Women]],  the agency  designated to implement UN Gender Policy,  however,  continues to  assert, including on its web site, that affirmative action for women remain in effect, and continues to be list it as applicable law.&lt;ref name="Gender related  system policies2"/&gt;  The Secretary General  has also  affirmed to the general assembly, as noted above,  that  Gender A/I, remains in effect.&lt;ref name="A /67/347"/&gt;{{rp|p 33, paragraph 67}}   As a result of the secretariat's reservation, and reluctance to implement gender A/I,  it has  been  implemented with diminishing enthusiasm,   and become a frequent cause of litigation.

== Special Measures and jurisprudence==
UNAT jurisprudence has, in its consideration of unsuccessful male candidates,  as well as claims of women under the Organization's affirmative action policies,   repeatedly upheld  affirmative action provisions in  ST/AI/412  and its  successor ST/AI 1999/9,   as lawful and in accordance with the  UN Charter. ST/AI 1999/9.   ST/AI 1999/9 continues to be cited as an applicable  instrument  by  applicants,  as well as the respondent,  in  cases before the  [[United Nations Dispute Tribunal|UN Dispute Tribunal(UNDT)]]   and the [[United Nations Appeals Tribunal (UNAT)]].

===Judgement No. 671, Grinblat(1994)===
United Nations Administrative tribunal  with Judge Sumar Sen as president,  in a seminal  Judgment on affirmative action,  held   : "that the various resolutions for Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter.&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations, article 8"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charter of the United Nations|title=Article 8 Charter of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter3.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=CHAPTER III: ORGANS|date=26 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the [[Charter of the United Nations|Charter]] must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this  unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8 permits the adoption of reasonable affirmative action measures for improvement of the status of women."&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|paragraph XVII}} The Tribunal added that,  "as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior".&lt;ref name=GRINBLAT1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=United Nations  Administrative Tribunal|title=GRINBLAT Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=Judgement|date=4 November 1994|volume=Judgement No. 671 Case No. 731|page=15, para XIX|pages=|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_00671_E.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2014|publisher=UN Administrative Tribunal|location=New York|quote=Mr. Samar Sen, President; Mr. Jerome Ackerman, Vice-President; Mr. Francis Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter&lt;ref name="Charter of the United Nations, article 101"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charter of the United Nations|title=Article 101(3) Charter of the United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter15.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=CHAPTER XV: THE SECRETARIAT|date=26 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; that officials of the Organization be of "the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity": "In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, pertinent provisions of the Charter may not be ignored.

===Judgement No. 1056,  Katz (2002)===
United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Mayer Gabay, President; Ms. Marsha A.Echols; and Mr. Omer Yousif Bireedo)  in the case of an unsuccessful male candidate who challenged the promotion of a woman as unlawful and in violation of his rights of due process,  citing UNAT Judgements No. 411 (1988) and No. 958 (2000), recalled its “established jurisprudence ... that appointments and promotions are within the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General”,&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|p6, paragraph IV}} and  that "qualifications, experience, favourable performance reports and seniority are appraised freely by the Secretary-General and therefore cannot be considered by staff members as giving rise to any expectancy".  The tribunal held that these "discretionary powers of the Secretary-General are not absolute.  They are governed by the relevant provisions of the Charter and by General Assembly resolutions.  In this context the Tribunal notes that ST/AI/412 provides that special measures for the achievement of gender equality within the Secretariat must be instituted towards achieving the goal of '50-50 parity between men and women both overall and for positions at the D-1 level and above by the year 2000.  It also provides for flexibility in various promotion requirements in order to increase the number of women considered for promotions, for example flexibility regarding seniority."&lt;ref name="AT/Dec/1056"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN Administrative Tribunal|title=Judgement No. 1056, KATZ Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=26 July 2002|volume=AT/Dec/1056|issue=Case No. 1152:|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01056_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph V}}

===Judgement No. 1302, (2006)===
United Nations Administrative  Tribunal (Mr. Spyridon Flogaitis, President; Mr. Kevin Haugh; Ms. Brigitte Stern) held  that ST/AI/1999/9 required that where there are both male and female candidates with substantially equal qualifications, "the female candidate should be appointed unless the qualifications of the male candidate are in some demonstrable and measurable way superior to those of the best qualified female candidate. The Tribunal has chosen to use the words 'demonstrable' and 'measurable' advisedly for, since appointment and promotion decisions are amenable to administrative review under the Organization's internal justice system and under the Statute of the Tribunal, and since the body carrying out such review ... should act on identifiable facts and on evidence, there should be evidence which can be examined and assessed by the body carrying out the review from which it can be determined if the affirmative action requirements have been fully complied with. This is an essential requirement if there is to be a meaningful review and if the policy of ST/AI/1999/9 or other affirmative action policy is to be enforced as an imperative. Otherwise, such policies become mere shibboleths or mere set pieces of lip service invoked in the pretence of achieving their objectives."&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}} The tribunal concluded that although as a general principle, the party making an allegation bears the burden of proving it,  but "this general proposition must require modification where the relevant evidence is solely in the hands of the Administration  and not available to an Applicant, the onus of proof in certain matters should be viewed as neutral rather than as resting on the Applicant".  The Tribunal, while  agreeing with the conclusions of the Joint Appeals Board (JAB) that "since there was no demonstrable or measurable evidence to support a conclusion that the successful male candidate enjoyed substantially superior qualifications when compared with those of the Applicant, a breach of ST/AI/1999/9 [had] been established"  Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay the Applicant the difference between her salary at the P-3 level and the P-4 salary that she would have received had she been appointed to the post in question, from October 2002, for the lesser of either two years or until her promotion to the P-4 level, and ordered the Respondent either to place the Applicant on the "Galaxy roster" until she secures a suitable post at the P-4 level or to pay her two months' net base salary .&lt;ref name="Judgement No. 1302"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=UN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL|title=Judgement No. 1302 Case No. 1386 Against: The Secretary-General of the United Nations|journal=ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS|date=29 September 2006|volume=AT /DEC/1302|issue=Judgement No. 1302|url=http://untreaty.un.org/UNAT/UNAT_Judgements/Judgements_E/UNAT_01302_E.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp| paragraph II}}

===Tribunal judgments and orders related to ST/AI/1999/9 (Gender AI)===
Gender A/I, as  already mentioned,  has often been a subject of litigation.  In cases brought before the tribunal,  the respondent, ie, the Secretary General,   has, so far, not contested the applicability of the  gender AI as applicable law.  The  tribunal  in  several cases has upheld the validity of Gender AI and  cited it in its judgment.

'''Theodorus of Gadara''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος ὁ Γαδαρεύς}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] rhetorician of the 1st century BC who founded a rhetorical school in [[Gadara]] (present-day [[Um Qais]], [[Jordan]]), where he taught future [[Roman emperor]] [[Tiberius]] the art of [[rhetoric]]. It was written of Tiberius that:

: ''...even in his boyhood, his cruel and cold nature did not lie hidden. Theodorus of Gadara was his teacher of rhetoric and, in all his wisdom, seems to have been the first to have understood Tiberius and to have capped him with a very pithy saying when he taunted Tiberius, calling him 'Mud kneaded with blood'... ''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', Tiberius 57&lt;/ref&gt;

His other well-known pupil was Greek rhetorician [[Hermagoras of Temnos]], who later taught [[Public speaking|oratory]] in [[Rome]].

Theodorus was one of the two most famous rhetoric teachers of the time, the other being [[Apollodorus of Pergamon]]. Students of Apollodorus were commonly referred to as ''[[Apollodorean]]s'', while students of Theodorus were known as ''[[Theodorean]]s''.

==Works==
According to the [[Suda]], Theodorus wrote the following books, among others&lt;ref&gt;Suda θ 151&lt;/ref&gt;: 
*''On Questions in Pronunciation'' (Περὶ τῶν ἐν φωναῖς ζητουμένων, in 3 books)
*''On History'' (Περὶ ἱστορίας, 1 book)
*''On Thesis'' (Περὶ θέσεως, 1 book)
*''On the Similarity of Dialects and its Demonstration'' (Περὶ διαλέκτων ὁμοιότητος καὶ ἀποδείξεως, 2 books)
*''On the Constitution'' (Περὶ πολιτείας, 2 books)
*''On Coele Syria'' (Περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας, 1 book)
*''On the Capacity of the Orator'' (Περὶ ῥήτορος δυνάμεως, 1 book)

'''Virtual heritage''' or '''cultural heritage and technology''' is the body of works dealing with information and communication technologies ([[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]]) and their application to [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''virtual [[archaeology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Bawaya|first = M.| title = Virtual Archaeologists Recreate Parts of Ancient Worlds | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 140–141 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1126/science.327.5962.140 | pmid=20056870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual heritage and cultural heritage have independent meanings: ''cultural heritage'' refers to sites, monuments, buildings and objects "with historical, aesthetic, archaeological, scientific, ethnological or anthropological value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/408 | title  = Application Guide  | author = [[UNESCO]] | year = 2008 | work = Applications to UNESCO-Vocations Patrimoine Fellowships for World Heritage site managers | publisher = [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] | accessdate = 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''virtual heritage'' refers to instances of these within a technological domain, usually involving [[Visualization (computer graphics)|computer visualization]] of artefacts or [[Virtual Reality]] environments.

One technology that is frequently employed in virtual heritage applications is [[augmented reality]], which is used to provide on-site reconstructions of archaeological sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archeoguide.intranet.gr/ | title  = ARCHEOGUIDE - Augmented Reality-based Cultural Heritage On-site Guide | year = 2002 | work = ARCHEOGUIDE Project | accessdate = 23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or artefacts.

Many virtual heritage projects focus on the tangible aspects of cultural heritage, for example [[3D modelling]], [[Computer graphics|graphics]] and [[Computer animation|animation]]. In doing so they often overlook the intangible aspects of cultural heritage associated with objects and sites, such as stories, performances and dances. The tangible aspects of cultural heritage are not inseparable from the intangible and one method for combining them is the use of virtual heritage [[serious game]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Anderson|first1 = E.

==First use==
The first use of virtual heritage as a museum exhibit, and the derivation of the name [[virtual tour]], was in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csanet.org/newsletter/feb95/nl029504.html | title  = Imaging The Past  | author = Susan S. Lukesh | date = Feb 1995 | work = CSA Newsletter, Feb. '95 | publisher = Center for the Study of Architecture | accessdate = 3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a museum visitor interpretation, providing a 'walk-through' of a [[3D reconstruction]] of [[Dudley Castle]] in [[England]] as it was in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Boland|first1 = P.|last2 = Johnson|first2 = C.|editor1-last = Higgins|editor1-first = T.|editor2-last = Main|editor2-first = P.|editor3-last = Lang|editor3-first = J.|contribution = Archaeology as computer visualization: 'Virtual tours' of Dudley Castle c. 1550|title = Imaging the Past: Electronic Imaging and Computer Graphics in Museums and Archaeology| series = Occasional Papers |volume = 114 |publisher = 
[[British Museum#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |pages= 227–234 |year=1996 | isbn = 0-86159-114-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc based system designed by British-based engineer Colin Johnson. It is a little-known fact that one of the first users of Virtual Heritage was [[Queen Elizabeth II]], when she officially opened the visitor centre in June 1994.
Because the Queen's officials had requested titles, descriptions and instructions of all activities, the system was named 'Virtual Tour', being a cross between [[virtual reality]] and Royal Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exrenda.com/dudley/index.htm|title=Virtual Tours of Dudley Castle archive|author=Colin Johnson|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
