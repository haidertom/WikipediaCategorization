      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">The '''1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras''' occurred when the [[Treaty of Gandomak]] was signed and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] ended in 1880, causing [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] to set out on a goal to bring Hazarajat and [[Kafiristan]] under his control. He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazaras in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, [[Sher Ali Khan]]. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"&gt;"HAZĀRA: ii. HISTORY". Alessandro Monsutti (Online ed.).

==First uprising==
The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat.

After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to [[Kabul]], opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan [[nomad]]s ([[Kuchis]]).&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

==Second uprising==
The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms".&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "[[jihad]]" against the Shias&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Afghanistan : Hazaras|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d693d.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads).&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; He also brought in [[British Raj|British]] military advisers to assist his army.&lt;ref name=Mousavi&gt;{{cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hazara people}}
The third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression; the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and [[Daychopan District|Daychopan]], continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, [[Mashhad]] (Iran) and [[Quetta]] (Pakistan). Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = تاریخ باستانی هزاره ها|last = دلجو|first = عباس|publisher = انتشارات امیری|year = 2014|isbn = 9936801504|location = کابل|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|major cities in Afghanistan]], Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.

In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

Vol. I.|last=Tillich|first=Paul|date=1951-01-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1340">'''Ahöla''', also known as '''Ahul''',  is a spirit being, a [[kachina]], embodied by a man, in [[Hopi religion]].

Ahöla is one of the important chief katsinam for [[First Mesa, Arizona|First and Second Mesas]], in [[Hopi]], because he opens the mid-winter Powamu ceremony, sometimes called the bean planting festival. On the first night of the festival, he performs inside a [[kiva]], the subterranean, ceremonial space, before going with the Powamu Chief to give prayer feathers to Kachina Spring at dawn. Afterwards, Ahöla and the Powamu Chief visit all of the kivas and ceremonial houses, giving out bean and corn plants and marking the doorways with stripes of cornmeal. At the end of the ceremony, Ahöla descends to a shrine, bows four times to the Sun, and asks for health, happiness, long life, and good crops. Ahöla is also the friend of Eototo, and one legend tells of 
Ahöla having his throat cut to let Eototo to escape.

{{distinguish|Alatri|Alastrim}}
'''Alatrism''' or '''alatry''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + λατρεία (''latreia'') = [[worship]]) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no [[supernatural]] significance, and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.

Alatrism is not the same as [[Deism]], which holds that one or more gods may exist, but do not intervene. Deism does not exclude worship, and alatrism does not exclude the possibility that gods intervene; alatrists usually believe that any divine intervention occurs only for the deity's/deities' own reasons, unconnected to any encouragement by devotees.

Historical alatrist groups include the [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreans]].

[[File:American Academy of Religion (logo).png|thumb]]
The '''American Academy of Religion''' ('''AAR''') is the world's largest association of [[scholar]]s in the [[List of academic disciplines|field]] of [[religious studies]] and related topics.  It is a nonprofit member association, 
serving as a professional and learned society for scholars involved in the academic study of religion. It has some 10,000 members worldwide, with the largest concentration being in the United States and Canada. AAR members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, seminarians, students, and interested lay-people.

== History ==

AAR was founded in 1909 as the Association of Biblical Instructors in American Colleges and Secondary Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gearon|first1=Liam|title=MasterClass in Religious Education: Transforming Teaching and Learning|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London / New York|isbn=9781441160065|page=40|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825398792|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to National Association of Biblical Instructors (NABI) in 1933. The American Academy of Religion was adopted as the organization name in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Elizabeth|title=Founding the Fathers|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4319-2|page=8|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700594|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect its broader, inclusive mission to foster the academic study of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;

Presidents of the AAR have included well-known scholars such as [[Judith Plaskow]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Emilie Townes]], [[Peter J. Paris]], [[Rebecca Chopp]], and [[Elizabeth A. Clark]].

== Publications ==

[[Oxford University Press]] publishes ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' on behalf of the AAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org
 |title=Journal of the American Academy of Religion
 |work=Oxford University Press Journals website
 |accessdate=2011-04-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religious Studies News'' is the quarterly newspaper of record for the organization; it transitioned from a print to online-only publication in 2010. AAR published the online book review Reading Religion. AAR publishes five book series through Oxford University Press: Academy; Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion; Religion, Culture, and Theory; Religion in Translation; and Teaching Religious Studies. AAR presents awards each year to notable books in the study of religion. It offers three categories of Awards for Excellence: Analytical-Descriptive Studies, Historical Studies, and Constructive-Reflective Studies.

== Annual meeting ==

AAR hosts an Annual Meeting each year in November. The AAR Annual Meeting is the world's largest meeting for religious studies scholars. Over 400 events, including meetings, receptions, and academic sessions, occur on the AAR program alone; hundreds more, hosted by affiliated societies and institutions, occur over the course of the meeting. Some 10,000 people attend the AAR Annual Meeting; the location of the meeting changes each year. The AAR Annual Meeting program is developed entirely by volunteers involved in program units representing disciplines and sub-disciplines within the field.

== Other activities ==

AAR offers activities on a regional level for its members. Professional development resources such as research grants, career services, and scholarships are some of the member benefits. AAR also advocates the importance of the critical study of religion on institutional and national levels.

An '''annual cycle''' refers to a set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.

In [[biology]], the annual cycle for plants and animals details behavioral and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, John M. and Houston, Alasdair I. (2008) "Introduction: Adaptation to the annual cycle" ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 363(1490):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a [[business cycle]] refers to the way modelling and analysis is applied to the periodic development and marketing of new products and services.

In [[religion]], the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, in [[Christianity]] the [[liturgical year]] is an annual cycle, which for some [[Christian denomination]]s is composed of the ''temporal cycle'' that tracks the events in the life of [[Christ]], and the ''sanctoral cycle'' which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the ''temporal cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;Flesher, Paul [http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm "Christian Time and Worship"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309191604/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }} ''Exploring Religions'' University of Wyoming&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in [[orbit]] over the course of the year.  Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming [[solar radiation]] at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[westerlies]] and [[polar easterlies|easterlies]] over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.

Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an [[anomaly time series]].

The word '''''catholic''''' (with lowercase ''c''; derived via [[Late Latin]] ''catholicus'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|καθολικός}} (''katholikos''), meaning "universal")&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(cf.

&lt;/ref&gt; it can also more narrowly refer{{sayswho|date=October 2018}} to [[Catholicity]], which encompasses several historic churches sharing major beliefs. "[[Catholicos]]", the title used for the head of some churches in  [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions, is derived from the same linguistic origin.

In non-ecclesiastical use, it derives its English meaning directly from its root, and is currently used to mean the following:
* including a wide variety of things; all-embracing
* universal or of general interest;
* [[liberalism|liberal]],{{sayswho|date=October 2018}} having broad interests, or wide sympathies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
* inclusive, inviting and containing strong evangelism.

The term has been incorporated into the name of the largest Christian communion, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (also called the Catholic Church). All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and [[Church of the East]]) had always identified themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, and some [[Methodism|Methodists]] also believe that their churches are "Catholic" in the sense that they too are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. However, each church defines the scope of the "Catholic Church" differently. For instance, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox churches, and Church of the East, each maintain that their own [[Christian denomination|denomination]] is identical with the original universal church, from which all other denominations broke away.

Distinguishing beliefs of [[Catholicity]], the beliefs of most Christians who call themselves "Catholic", include the [[episcopal polity]], that [[bishop]]s are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion,&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross, ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1977:175.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Nicene Creed]] of AD 381.  In particular, along with unity, [[sanctity]], and [[apostolicity]], catholicity is considered one of [[Four Marks of the Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Christliche Religion, Oskar Simmel Rudolf Stählin, 1960, 150&lt;/ref&gt; found the line of the Nicene Creed: "I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church."

During the medieval and modern times, additional distinctions arose regarding the use of the terms ''Western Catholic'' and ''Eastern Catholic''. Before the [[East–West Schism]], those terms had just the basic geographical meanings, since only one undivided Catholicity existed, uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. After the split of 1054 terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and conflicting terminological systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Google books |id=0UIKAQAAMAAJ |title=Inventing Latin Heretics: Byzantines and the Filioque in the Ninth Century }} pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The Greek adjective ''katholikos'', the origin of the term "catholic" means "universal". Directly from the Greek, or via [[Late Latin]] ''catholicus'', the term ''catholic'' entered many other languages, becoming the base for the creation of various theological terms such as ''catholicism'' and ''[[catholicity]]'' ([[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', ''catholicitas'').

The term "catholicism" is the [[English language|English]] form of [[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', an abstract noun based on the adjective "catholic". The Modern Greek equivalent {{lang|el|[[:el:Καθολικισμός|καθολικισμός]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|katholikismos}}'') is back-formed and usually refers to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;!--did the people citing "καθολικισμός" even check a dictionary?--&gt;

The terms "catholic", "catholicism" and "catholicity" is closely related to the use of the term ''[[Catholic Church (disambiguation)|Catholic Church]]''. The earliest evidence of the use of that term is the ''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'' that [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote in about 108 to Christians in [[Smyrna]]. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their [[bishop]], he wrote: "Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is, there is the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="Smyrnaeans 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vii.viii.html|title=Chapter VIII.—Let nothing be done without the bishop|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angle|first=Paul T.|title=The Mysterious Origins of Christianity|publisher=Wheatmark, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58736-821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the second half of the second century, the word "catholic" began to be used to mean "orthodox" (non-heretical), "because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html|title=Ignatius Epistle to the Smyrnaeans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 380, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] limited use of the term "Catholic Christian" exclusively to those who followed the same faith as [[Pope Damasus I]] of Rome and [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Pope Peter of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html|title=Medieval Sourcebook: Theodosian Code XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other early writers including [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315–386), [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) further developed the use of the term "catholic" in relation to Christianity.

===Ignatius of Antioch===
[[File:Ignjatije Antiohijski.jpg|thumb|Ignatius of Antioch]]
The earliest recorded evidence of the use of the term "Catholic Church" is the ''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'' that [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote in about 107 to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their [[bishop]], he wrote: "Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever [[Jesus Christ]] is, there is the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="Smyrnaeans 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vii.viii.html|title=Chapter VIII.—Let nothing be done without the bishop|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angle|first=Paul T.|title=The Mysterious Origins of Christianity|publisher=Wheatmark, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=9781587368219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the meaning for Ignatius of this phrase J.H. Srawley wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' (ἡ καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία). The original sense of the word is 'universal'. Thus Justin Martyr (''Dial''. 82) speaks of the 'universal or [[general resurrection]]', using the words ἡ καθολικὴ ἀνάστασις. Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the aggregate of all the Christian congregations' (Swete, ''Apostles Creed'', p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century]] it began to receive the secondary sense of '[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]' as opposed to '[[heresy|heretical]]'. Thus it is used in an early [[Biblical Canon|Canon of Scripture]], the [[Muratorian fragment]] (''circa'' 170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church'. So too [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world', but also 'because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men'. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.&lt;ref&gt;[J.H. Srawley, The Epistles of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, vol. II,] pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html another edition], p.97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By ''Catholic Church'' Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that "he only seemed to suffer" (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"As certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be Christians". Ignatius said these heretics did not believe in the reality of Christ's flesh, which did suffer and was raised up again: "They confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again" (Smyrnaeans, 7) and called them "beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with" (Smyrnaeans, 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other second-century uses===
The term is also used in the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' (155) and in the [[Muratorian fragment]] (about 177).

===Cyril of Jerusalem===
[[File:Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb]]
As mentioned in the above quotation from J.H. Srawley, [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315–386), who is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]], distinguished what he called the "Catholic Church" from other groups who could also refer to themselves as an ἐκκλησία (assembly or church):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the word [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]] is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, ''And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly'' (Acts 19:14), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a ''Church of evil doers'', I mean the meetings of the heretics, the [[Marcionism|Marcionists]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichees]], and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, "And in one Holy Catholic Church"; that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in which you were regenerated. And if ever you are sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the [[Bride of Christ|spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ]], the Only-begotten [[Son of God]](Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Theodosius I===
[[File:Theodosius.jpg|thumb|Theodosius I]]
[[Theodosius I]], Emperor from 379 to 395, declared "Catholic" Christianity the [[state religion|official religion]] of the Roman Empire, declaring in the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] of 27 February 380:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our clemency and moderation, should continue the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the [[Pope Damasus I|Pontiff Damasus]] and by [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter, Bishop of Alexandria]], a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one Deity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy [[Trinity]]. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title ''Catholic'' Christians; but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation, and in the second the punishment which our authority, in accordance with the will of heaven, will decide to inflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bettenson|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Scowcroft Bettenson|title=Documents of the Christian Church|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1967|isbn=9780195012934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9L2UaDJLGkC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodosian Code XVI.i.2&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Augustine of Hippo===
[[File:Augustinus 1.jpg|thumb|Augustine of Hippo]]
Only slightly later, Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) also used the term "Catholic" to distinguish the "true" church from heretical groups:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the [[Apostle Peter]], to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15–19), down to the present [[historical episcopate|episcopate]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&amp;nbsp;—St. Augustine (354–430): ''Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental'', chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith.

===St Vincent of Lerins===
A contemporary of Augustine, [[St. Vincent of Lerins]], wrote in 434 (under the pseudonym Peregrinus) a work known as the ''[[Commonitory|Commonitoria]]'' ("Memoranda"). While insisting that, like the human body, church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Commonitory for the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies.|publisher=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|author=[[Vincent of Lerins]]|accessdate=2012-03-05|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf211.iii.xxiv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stated:

{{quote|In the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all.

This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient definitions and determinations of all, or at the least of almost all priests and doctors.|''A Commonitory for the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies'', section 6, end of chapter II&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Commonitory for the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies.|publisher=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|author=[[Vincent of Lerins]]|accessdate=2012-03-05|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf211.iii.iii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{See also|Western Catholic (disambiguation)|Eastern Catholic (disambiguation)}}
During early centuries of Christian history, majority of Christians who followed doctrines represented in [[Nicene Creed]] were bound by one common and undivided [[Catholicity]] that was uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. In those days, terms "eastern Catholic" and "western Catholic" had their basic geographical meanings, generally corresponding to existing linguistic distinctions between Greek East and Latin West. In spite of various and quite frequent theological and ecclesiastical disagreements between major Christian sees, common [[Catholicity]] was preserved until the great disputes that arose between 9th and 11th century. After the [[East–West Schism]], the notion of common [[Catholicity]] was broken and each side started to develop its own terminological practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

All major theological and ecclesiastical disputes in the Christian East or West have been commonly accompanied by attempts of arguing sides to deny each other the right to use the word "Catholic" as term of self-designation. After the acceptance of [[Filioque]] clause into the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Rome, Orthodox Christians in the East started to refer to adherents of Filioquism in the West just as "Latins" considering them no longer to be "Catholics".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The dominant view in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that all Western Christians who accepted Filioque interpolation and unorthodox Pneumatology ceased to be Catholics, was held and promoted by famous Eastern Orthodox canonist [[Theodore Balsamon]] who was [[patriarch of Antioch]]. He wrote in 1190:

{{quote|For many years the once illustrious congregation of the Western Church, that is to say, the Church of Rome, has been divided in spiritual communion from the other four Patriarchates, and has separated itself by adopting customs and dogmas alien to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox ... So no Latin should be sanctified by the hands of the priests through divine and spotless Mysteries unless he first declares that he will abstain from Latin dogmas and customs, and that he will conform to the practice of the Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=KugGDAAAQBAJ |title=Heresy and the Making of European Culture: Medieval and Modern Perspectives }} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other side of the widening rift, Eastern Orthodox were considered by western theologians to be ''Schismatics''. Relations between East and West were further estranged by the tragic events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 and [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)#Sack of Constantinople|Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204. Those bloody events were followed  by several failed attempts to reach reconciliation (see: [[Second Council of Lyon]], [[Council of Florence]], [[Union of Brest]], [[Union of Uzhhorod]]). During the late medieval and early modern period, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems that exist today in all of their complexity.

During the Early Modern period, a special term "Acatholic" was widely used in the West to mark all those who were considered to hold heretical theological views and irregular ecclesiastical practices. In the time of [[Counter-Reformation]] the term ''Acatholic'' was used by zealous members of the [[Catholic Church]] to designate [[Protestants]] as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term was considered to be so insulting that the Council of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Serbian Orthodox Church]], held in [[Timișoara|Temeswar]] in 1790, decided to send an official plea to emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], begging him to ban the use of the term "Acatholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=aSlYAAAAcAAJ |title=Радња Благовештенског сабора народа србског у Сремским Карловцима }} p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lutheran Churches ===
The [[Augsburg Confession]] found within the [[Book of Concord]], a compendium of belief of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, teaches that "the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luther’s Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|publisher=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|accessdate=22 February 2017|quote= When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, “This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers” (AC XXI Conclusion 1). The underlying thesis of the Augsburg Confession is that the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church. In fact, it is actually the Church of Rome that has departed from the ancient faith and practice of the catholic church (see AC XXIII 13, XXVIII 72 and other places).}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1530, they believe to have "showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"/&gt;

==Contemporary use{{anchor|Divergent usages}}==
The term "Catholic" is commonly associated with the whole of the church led by the Roman Pontiff, the [[Catholic Church]]. Other Christian churches that use the description "Catholic" include the Eastern Orthodox Church and other churches that believe in the [[historic episcopate]] (bishops), such as the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;!--Some of them claim to be the one true Catholic Church from which, in their view, other Christians, including those in communion with the Pope, have fallen away.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roacusa.org/OrthodoxSchool/TwoThousandYearOldApostolic/Christianity.doc Steven Kovacevich, Apostolic Christianity and the 23,000 Western Churches], especially p. 15{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodox.cn/contemporary/20000814basicprinciples/basicprinciples_encn.pdf Basic Principles Of The Attitude of The Russian Orthodox Church toward the Other Christian Confessions, adopted by the Jubilee Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, 14 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who apply the term "Catholic Church" to all Christians object to the use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they understand as the "whole" Catholic Church.  In the [[English language]], the first known use of the term is in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''[[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]]'', "He was a constant Catholic/All Lollard he hated and heretic."&lt;ref&gt;"Catholic", in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''(1989), New York:  [[Oxford University Press]], [spelling modernized].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Catholic Church|Roman Catholic (term)}}
The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Pope]] in Rome, usually distinguishes itself from other churches by calling itself the "Catholic", however has also used the description "Roman Catholic". Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective "Roman" for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis''.] Another example is its self-description as "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html English translation by [[Henry Edward Manning]] in [[Philip Schaff]], ''Creeds of Christendom: Volume II.

In all of these documents it also refers to itself both simply as the Catholic Church and by other names. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], while united with Rome in the faith, have their own traditions and laws, differing from those of the [[Latin Rite]] and those of other Eastern Catholic Churches.

The contemporary Catholic Church has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, and consider all others as "non-Catholics". This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term "Catholic Church", considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm Smyrnaeans, 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and the 22 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] consider that they continue and are charged with preserving the catholic tradition as handed down from the [[Early Church Fathers]]. Eastern Catholic churches are those [[particular church]]es that, in full communion with the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] — the Pope — while remaining autonomous (in Latin, ''sui iuris''), preserve the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions of the various Eastern Christian churches with which they are associated. They include the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian]], [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Greek]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melkite]], [[Maronite Church|Maronite]], [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Byzantine]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Syro-Malankara]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] and [[Ethiopic Catholic Church|Ethiopic]] Rites. Under [[Pope John Paul II]] the Catholic Church issued a book of beliefs, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', which states: "To believe that the Church is 'holy' and 'catholic,' and that she is 'one' and 'apostolic' (as the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P26.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 750]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In the [[English language]], the first known use of the term is in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''[[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]]'', "He was a constant Catholic/All Lollard he hated and heretic."&lt;ref&gt;"Catholic", in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''(1989), New York:  [[Oxford University Press]], [spelling modernized].&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The term "Catholic" is commonly associated with the whole of the church led by the Roman Pontiff, the [[Catholic Church]], and whose over one billion adherents are about half of the estimated [[Largest religion|2.1 billion Christians]]. Other Christian churches also laying claim to the description "Catholic" include the Eastern Orthodox Church and those churches possessing the historic episcopate (bishops), such as those of the Anglican Communion. Some of them claim to be the one true Catholic Church from which, in their view, other Christians, including those in communion with the Pope, have fallen away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roacusa.org/OrthodoxSchool/TwoThousandYearOldApostolic/Christianity.doc Steven Kovacevich, Apostolic Christianity and the 23,000 Western Churches], especially p. 15{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodox.cn/contemporary/20000814basicprinciples/basicprinciples_encn.pdf Basic Principles Of The Attitude of The Russian Orthodox Church toward the Other Christian Confessions, adopted by the Jubilee Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, 14 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Many of those who apply the term "Catholic Church" to all Christians object to the use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they understand as the "whole" Catholic Church. However, the church in communion with the Bishop of Rome, both in its Western form and in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, with all others as "non-Catholics" and regularly refers to itself as "the Catholic Church". This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term "Catholic Church", considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm Smyrnaeans, 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Though normally distinguishing itself from other churches by calling itself the "Catholic Church", it also uses the description "Roman Catholic Church". Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective "Roman" for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis''.] Another example is its self-description as "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html English translation by [[Henry Edward Manning]] in [[Philip Schaff]], ''Creeds of Christendom: Volume II. The History of Creeds'']&lt;/ref&gt; (or, by separating each adjective, as the "Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Catholic.).
--&gt;

Regarding the relations with Eastern Christians, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated his wish to restore [[full communion|full unity]] with the Orthodox. The Roman Catholic Church considers that almost all of the ancient theological differences have been satisfactorily addressed (the [[Filioque]] clause, the nature of [[purgatory]], etc.), and has declared that differences in traditional customs, observances and discipline are no obstacle to unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council Decree on Ecumenism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |date=6 March 2013 }}, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent historic ecumenical efforts on the part of the Catholic Church have focused on healing the rupture between the Western ("Catholic") and the Eastern ("Orthodox") churches. [[Pope John Paul II]] often spoke of his great desire that the Catholic Church "once again breathe with both lungs",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html Encyciclical ''Ut unum sint''], 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_sacri-canones_lt.html Apostolic Constitution ''Sacri Canones'']&lt;/ref&gt; thus emphasizing that the Roman Catholic Church seeks to restore [[Full communion#Roman Catholic Church|full communion]] with the separated Eastern churches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism Obituary of Pope John Paul II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox Church|Church of the East}}
All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and [[Church of the East]]) are continuing to identify themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=ZC7B3v80C |title=Catholicity and the Church }} pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] firmly upholds the ancient doctrines of [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Catholicity of the Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Catholicity]] and commonly uses the term ''Catholic'', as in the title of [http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'']. So does the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] that belongs to [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and considers its communion to be "the True Church of the Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suscopts.org/pdf/copticchurch/rituals2.pdf Characteristics of Our Coptic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; Non of the Eastern Churches, Orthodox or Oriental, have any intention to abandon ancient traditions of their own Catholicity.

===Protestantism===
Most [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and post-Reformation churches use the term ''Catholic'' (often with a lower-case ''c'') to refer to the belief that all Christians are part of one Church regardless of denominational divisions; e.g., Chapter XXV of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] refers to the "catholic or universal Church". It is in line with this interpretation, which applies the word "catholic" (universal) to no one denomination, that they understand the phrase "[[one holy catholic and apostolic Church]]" in the [[Nicene Creed]], the phrase ''the Catholic faith'' in the [[Athanasian Creed]] and the phrase "holy catholic church" in the [[Apostles' Creed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The term is used also to mean those Christian churches that maintain that their [[Historical episcopate|episcopate]] can be [[apostolic succession|traced unbrokenly back]] to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and consider themselves part of a ''catholic'' (universal) body of believers. Among those who regard themselves as ''Catholic'' but not ''Roman Catholic'' are [[Anglican]]s{{cn|date=April 2018}} and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]],&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"/&gt; who stress that they are both Reformed and Catholic. The [[Old Catholic Church]] and the various groups classified as [[Independent Catholic Churches]] also lay claim to the description ''Catholic''. [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, even if they may not be in communion with Rome, consider themselves to be not only Catholics but the "true" Roman Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Some use the term "Catholic" to distinguish their own position from a [[Calvinist]] or [[Puritan]] form of Reformed-[[Protestantism]]. These include a faction of Anglicans often also called [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], 19th century [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutherans]], 20th century [[High Church Lutheran]]s or [[evangelical-Catholic]]s and others.

[[Methodist]]s and [[Presbyterian]]s believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early church, but do not claim descent from ancient church structures such as the episcopate. However, both of these churches hold that they are a part of the catholic (universal) church. According to ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'': {{quote|The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no [[intercommunion]]...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers. As a further necessary consequence, it is plain that the Roman Church is no more Catholic in any sense than a Methodist or a Baptist.&lt;ref name="Harper's new monthly magazine, Volume 37, Issues 217-222"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tko9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA422&amp;dq=infidel+methodist+catholic&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=infidel%20methodist%20catholic| title = Harper's new monthly magazine, Volume 37, Issues 217-222 |quote=The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no intercommunion...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers.

===Independent Catholicism===
Some Independent Catholics accept that, among bishops, that of Rome is ''primus inter pares'', and hold that [[conciliarism]] is a necessary check against [[ultramontanism]]. They are however, by definition, not recognised by the [[Catholic Church]].

==Avoidance of use==
Some Protestant churches avoid using the term completely, to the extent among many Lutherans of reciting the Creed with the word "Christian" in place of "catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Criticism of religion''' is [[criticism]] of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of [[religion]], including its political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| page=2| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records of criticism of religion goes back to at least 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]], with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the Atheist" of Melos]]. In [[ancient Rome]], an early known example is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' from the 1st century BCE.

Every exclusive religion on Earth that promotes [[Truth claim|exclusive truth]] claims necessarily denigrates the truth claims of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Saumur v Quebec (City of)]]''. &lt;br/&gt;See also: &lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Gelber|author2=Adrienne Sarah Ackary Stone|title=Hate Speech and Freedom of Speech in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3oYYweMrF8C|year=2007|publisher=Federation Press|isbn=978-1-86287-653-8|quote=In some belief systems, religious leaders and believers maintain the right to both emphasise the benefits of their own religion and criticise other religions; that is, they make their own claims and deny the truth claims of others.|page=179}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|quote=Due to the nature of religious belief, one person's faith often implies that another's is wrong and perhaps even offensive, constituting blasphemy.

==History of criticism of religion==
In his work ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, [[Lucretius]], believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in Gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&amp;nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford - Lucretius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.&lt;ref name="Latin-English: On Nature"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D. Rouse|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99200-8|author=Lucretius|page=8|quote=This (superstition) or "false religion", not "religion," is the meaning of "religio". The Epicureans were opposed, not to religion (cf. 6.68–79), but to traditional religion which taught that the gods govern the world. That Lucretius regarded "religio" as synonymous with "superstitio" is implied by "super....instans" in [line] 65.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Middlemore, S. G. C. |author2=Burckhardt, Jacob |author3=Murray, Peter |author4=Burke, Peter |title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy |publisher=Penguin Classics |location= |year= 1990|isbn=0-14-044534-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], religion was merely a tool, useful for a ruler wishing to manipulate public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm |title=The Prince | first= Nicolo |last= Machiavelli | year = 1532| accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
In the early 21st century, the [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the four Horsemen's works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attacks human dignity and the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. While according to Zenc the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged it does not, stand up to the full definition of a movement.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Response to general criticism of religion in an historical context===

{{Main|Religion|Definition of religion}}

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.&lt;ref name="Nongbri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt; However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubuisson"/&gt;

Before the 17th century religion was conflated with every day life. [[Religion]] as a modern Western concept developed from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="50 myths"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Morreall|first1= John|last2= Sonn|first2= Tamara|title= 50 Great Myths of Religion|chapter= Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions|date= 2013|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|isbn= 9780470673508|pages= 12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nongbri|first1= Brent|title= Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date= 2013|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Harrison|first1= Peter|title= The Territories of Science and Religion|date= 2015|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 022618448X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WLvnBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1= Daniel|last1= Dubuisson|title= The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date= 2007|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore, Md.|isbn= 0801887569 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kyl5K2TV8zMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Asia, no one before the 19th century self-identified as a "Hindu" or other similar identities.&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|pages=11–12|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;

With the existence of diverse modern categories of religion such as [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Nontheistic religions|nontheism]] and diverse specific religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and many others, it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.

==Explanations as non-divine in origin==

===Social construct===
{{See also|Development of religion}}

Dennett and Harris have asserted that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]] and [[political]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quote|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref name="critright"/&gt;}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="critright"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | location = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'']]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to virus of the mind criticism====

Both the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory which has mostly been abandoned. [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation [...] is [...] far removed from evidence and data" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than [[Darwinian]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also points out that it is surveys in the United States report a high life satisfaction rate among the religious is not comparable with a virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig]] and Cohen, ''The Link between Religion and Health'', OUP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness or delusion===
{{see also|Neuroscience of religion|Psychology of religion#Religion and mental illness|Religion and schizophrenia}}

[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] compares religion to [[mental illness]], saying it "allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them ''holy''".&lt;!--Italicized in original--&gt;&lt;ref name=endoffaith&gt;{{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | authorlink =Sam Harris (author) | title=The End of Faith | publisher=W.W.

Ramachandran]] suggests "It's possible that many great religious leaders had [[temporal lobe seizure]]s and this predisposes them to having visions, having mystical experiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = God on the Brain | work = | publisher =BBC Science &amp; Nature | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/godonbraintrans.shtml | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Persinger]] stimulated the temporal lobes of the brain artificially with a magnetic field using a device nicknamed the "[[God helmet]]" and was able to artificially induce religious experiences along with [[near-death experience]]s and [[ghost]] sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Shermer, Michael| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_6_59/ai_57800244| title=Why People Believe in God: An Empirical Study on a Deep Question| publisher=American Humanist Association| page=2| date=1999-11-01| accessdate=2006-04-05| authorlink= Michael Shermer}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Bradshaw (author)|John Bradshaw]] "Some forms of temporal lobe tumours or [[epilepsy]] are associated with extreme religiosity." In his research recent brain imaging of religious subjects praying or meditating show identical activity in the respective human section of the brain which [[Ramachandran]] calls God-spots.

[[Psilocybin]] from mushrooms affect regions of the brain includingthe serotonergic system, which generating a sense of strong religious meaning, unity and ecstasy.

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''Why People Believe Strange Things'' he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand. This is similar to the arguments made by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225371513|title=Breaking the spell : religion as a natural phenomenon|last=Clement)|first=Dennett, D.

(Daniel|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780143038337|location=London|oclc=225371513}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Shermer's argument goes further in that the peculiar and at times frightening rituals of religion are but one of many forms of strange customs that survive  to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144596155|title=Why people believe weird things : pseudoscience, superstition, and other confusions of our time|last=Michael.|first=Shermer,|date=2007|publisher=Souvenir|isbn=9780285638037|location=London|oclc=144596155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immature stage of societal development===
[[File:Daniel Huntington Philosophy and Christian Art.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Natural philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Christian Art]], W. Ridgway, 1878]]
Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comte|first=Auguste|title=Course of Positive Philosophy (1830)|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/comte_cpp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===

In his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', [[Keith Ward]] notes that not all false opinions are delusions and that belief in God is different as many great minds and people who live ordinary lives and believe in God are not irrational people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperreligiosity or even "intensely professed atheism" can emerge from emotional disturbances involving temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm to individuals==
Some have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous practices such as self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="self-sacrifice"&gt;Branden, N. (1963), "Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice," Ayn Rand – The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem syndrome===

Jerusalem has loaned its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor killings and stoning===
{{Main|Honor killings|stoning}}
Honor killings once well known in the Western are now extremely rare however they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor is when a person is killed by family for bringing [[honour|dishonor]] or [[shame]] upon the family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3 |title=Ethics - Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues.

===Genital modification and mutilation===
According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]]'s execution.

During the 19th century, the [[conflict thesis]] developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=David B.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|chapter=The Historiography of Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical conflict thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Colin A.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|page=7|chapter=The Conflict Thesis |quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapin1996"&gt;{{Cite book

[[C. S. Lewis]] suggests that all religions by definition involve [[faith]], or a belief in concepts that cannot be proven or disproven by the [[science]]s. Not all religious people subscribe to the idea that [[religion]] and [[science]] are mutually exclusive ([[non-overlapping magisteria]]) as do some atheists including [[Stephen Jay Gould]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]] |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year= 2002|isbn=0-345-45040-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist Richard Dawkins has said that religious practitioners often do not believe in the view of non-overlapping magisteria.&lt;ref name="sevenseven"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=The God Delusion|edition=Paperback|year=2007|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morality==
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] contends that [[Theism|theistic religions]] devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the [[Bible]] contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| newspaper=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".&lt;ref name="Morality Continues to Decay"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&amp;Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
{{See also|Indoctrination|Mind control|Religion and children|Child marriage}}
In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.&lt;ref&gt;"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] has permitted the [[child marriage]] of older men to girls as young as 9 years of age.&lt;ref name="seyaj.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children. |url=http://seyaj.org/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822141947/http://seyaj.org/en/ |archivedate=August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptists|Baptist]] pastor [[Jerry Vines]] denounced Mohammed as a [[pedophile]] for marying and having had sex with a nine-year-old, referring to Muhammad as a "demon-possessed paedophile".&lt;ref name="Vines"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Cooperman | first=Alan | title=Anti-Muslim Remarks Stir Tempest | date=2002-06-20 | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14499-2002Jun19?language=printer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuals===

{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old testament of the bible and in the Koran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2006&amp;author=Stephanie+Simon&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduces discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |wor = |language= |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|Burning cross often used by [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate minorities]]
In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Christian Identity]] movement has been associated with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism &amp; Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Genealogy |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are arguments that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ostensibly scientific": cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), "Racism", p. 716: "This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority"; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), "Race, theories of", p. 18: "Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history"; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. "In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist" (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: "Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had [[Black people and Mormonism|excluded African Americans]] from the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] from 1860 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church|year=2002|first=Richard|last=Abanes|authorlink=Richard Abanes|isbn=1-56858-219-6|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], rejected the Church's 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood and continue to deny activity in the church due to race.&lt;ref name="Primergroups"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities: Fundamentalist Mormon Communities |url=http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/cmsdocuments/The_Primer.pdf |publisher=Utah Attorney General's Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office |accessdate=29 June 2010 |date=June 2006 |page=41 |format=PDF |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Women===

[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]

The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] for both genders and fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic laws]] have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful [[female genital mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Namazie]] argues that women are victimized under [[Sharia law]], both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.&lt;ref name="onelawforall.org.uk"&gt;http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|work=Middle East Forum|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====

Christianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2030628/The_Christian_Mens_Oldest_Prejudice_Misogyny_Hate_Or_Fear|title=The Christian Men's Oldest Prejudice: Misogyny, Hate Or Fear?|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic and that the "dread of female [[seduction]]" can be found in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; K. K. Ruthven argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

Christian religious figures have been involved in the Middle Ages and early modern period [[Witch-hunt|witch trials]], which were generally used to punish assertive or independent women such as [[midwife|midwives]] since [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[activists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Shechita]] slaughter of a chicken]]
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; Sometimes these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|pages=75–92|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3 and that "these laws are binding on Jews today".&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

While supporters of [[Shechita|kosher slaughter]] counter that [[Judaism]] requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane,&lt;ref name="Chabad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222241/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Practice-Shechita.htm|title=Why Do Jews Practice Shechita?|author=Shechita UK|work=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by [[Temple Grandin]] and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that—practiced correctly with proper restraint systems—kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint.&lt;ref name="Grandin"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Temple |last1=Grandin |first2=Joe M. |last2=Regenstein|date=March 1994|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|journal=Meat Focus International|publisher=CAB International|pages=115–123|url=http://grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; those who practice and subscribe religiously and philosophically to [[Jewish vegetarianism]] disagree, stating that such slaughter is not required while a number, including medieval scholars of [[Judaism]] such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]], regard vegetarianism as a moral [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], not just out of a concern for [[animal welfare]], but also the slaughterer.&lt;ref name="innernet1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |title=Contemporary Halakhic Problems |volume=3 |last=Bleich |first=J. David |authorlink=J. David Bleich |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=1989 |quote=A number of medieval scholars regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because of the fact that the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits, viz., meanness and cruelty |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518014142/http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy. Writing for [[PETA]], Logan Scherer said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref name="PETA Islam animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/12/08/the-cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter.aspx | title=The Cruelty Behind Muslim Ritual Slaughter | publisher=PETA | date=December 8, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Scherer, Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.&lt;ref name="BBC Islam Animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml | title=Treatment of animals: Islam and animals | publisher=BBC | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism of morality===

Not all religions are hostile to homosexuality. Both [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] have advocated for equal rights for gay and lesbian people since the 1970s.{{efn|In 1970, the UUA passed a resolution calling for an end to anti-gay discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy/facts&lt;/ref&gt; The Union for Reform Judaism passed a similar resolution in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-reform-judaism&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] does not view homosexuality as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm] quote - "''Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominionism===
{{Main|Dominionism}}
{{See also|Dominion theology|Christian reconstructionism}}
The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W. Whitehead]] and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere.&lt;ref name=berlet1998 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ansell | first=Amy E | title =Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics | publisher =Westview Press | year =1998 | location = | url = | doi = | isbn=0-8133-3147-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Schaeffer | first =Francis | authorlink =Francis Schaeffer | title =A Christian Manifesto | publisher =Crossway Books | year =1982  | location = | url = | doi = |  isbn=0-89107-233-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have used the word "dominionism" to refer to adherence to [[dominion theology]]&lt;ref name="Barron1992a"&gt;{{cite book | last=Barron | first=Bruce | year=1992 | title=Heaven on Earth?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5917">{{Hatnote|This article discusses the original meaning of the word "''cult''", not the term in the [[sociology of religion]], [[new religious movement]]s called "[[cult]]s", [[cult of personality|cults of personality]], or popular [[cult following]]s.}} 
{{other|Cult (disambiguation)}}

'''Cult''' is literally the "care" (Latin ''[[wikt:cultus|cultus]]'') owed to deities and to temples, shrines, or churches.  Cult is embodied in [[ritual]] and [[ceremony]]. Its present or former presence is made concrete in [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s and [[Church (building)|churches]], and [[cult image]]s, including cult images and [[votive offering]]s at [[votive site]]s.

In the specific context of the [[Greek hero cult]], Carla Antonaccio wrote,
{{quote|The term ''cult'' identifies a pattern of ritual behavior in connection with specific objects, within a framework of spatial and temporal coordinates. ''Rituals'' would include (but not necessarily be limited to) prayer, sacrifice, votive offerings, competitions, processions and construction of monuments. Some degree of recurrence in place and repetition over time of ritual action is necessary for a cult to be enacted, to be practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Antonaccio, "Contesting the Past: Hero Cult, Tomb Cult, and Epic in Early Greece", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''98'''.3 (July 1994: 389-410) p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Etymology==
[[Cicero]] defined ''[[religio]]'' as ''cultus deorum'', "the cultivation of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2.8 and 1.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The "cultivation" necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god's ''cultus,'' "cult," and required "the knowledge of giving the gods their due" ''(scientia colendorum deorum)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods'' (University of California Press, 2009), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The noun ''cultus'' originates from the [[participle|past participle]] of the verb ''colo, colere, colui, cultus'', "to tend, take care of, cultivate," originally meaning "to dwell in, inhabit" and thus "to tend, cultivate [[#ager|land ''(ager)'']]; to practice agriculture," an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized. ''Cultus'' is often translated as "cult" without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the [[Old English]] word "[[worship]]", but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. ''Cultus'' was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see ''[[do ut des]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods,'' pp. 5–7; Valerie M. Warrior, ''Roman Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 6; James B. Rives, ''Religion in the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 13, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] echoes Cicero's formulation when he declares, "''religio'' is nothing other than the ''cultus'' of [[God in Christianity|God]]."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 10.1; Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cult" first appeared in [[English language|English]] in 1617, derived from the French ''culte'', meaning "[[worship]]" which in turn originated from the [[Latin]] word ''cultus'' meaning "care, cultivation, worship". The meaning "devotion to a person or thing" is from 1829. Starting about 1920, "cult" acquired an additional six or more positive and negative definitions. In French, for example, sections in newspapers giving the schedule of worship for [[Catholic Church|Catholic services]] are headed ''Culte Catholique'', while the section giving the schedule of Protestant services is headed ''culte réformé''. Within the Catholic church the most promenant Cults are those of the [[Cult of Saints|saints]].

==In Christianity==
In the [[Catholic Church]], outward religious practice in ''cultus'' is the technical term for [[Roman Catholic devotions]] or [[veneration]] extended to a particular [[saint]], not to the worship of God. Catholicism and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] make a major distinction between ''[[latria]]'', the worship that is offered to God alone, and ''[[wikt:dulia|dulia]]'', which is veneration offered to the saints, including the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|veneration of Mary]], whose veneration is often referred to as ''[[hyperdulia]]''.

==Outwards religious practice==
Outward religious practice in worship are [[ritual]]s, [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], [[liturgy]] or audits, which may involve spoken or sung words, and often involve personal [[sacrifice]]. Other outward manifestations of the cult of a deity are the preservation of [[relic]]s or the creation of images, such as [[icon]]s (usually connoting a flat painted image) or three-dimensional [[cult image|cultic image]]s, denigrated as "[[Cult image|idol]]s", and the specification of sacred places, hilltops and mountains, fissures and caves, springs, pools and groves, or even individual trees or stones, which may be the seat of an [[oracle]] or the venerated site of a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]], [[miracle]] or other occurrence commemorated or recreated in outward religious practice. [[Sacred]] places may be identified and elaborated by construction of [[shrine]]s, [[temple]]s, and [[Church (building)|churches]], on which are centered public attention at [[religious festival]]s and which may become the center for [[pilgrimage]]s.

'''Desecularization''' is a sociological term that describes the proliferation or growth of religion, usually after a period of prior [[secularization]]. The theory of desecularization is reactionary to the older theory known as The Secularization Thesis, which referred to the gradual decline religion to a point of extinction. In the last few decades, scholars have gestured to continued church attendance in Western countries, the rise in religious [[fundamentalism]] and the prevalence of religious conflict as evidence of the continued relevance of religion in the modern world.&lt;ref name="Berger_page2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The desecularization of the world : resurgent religion and world politics|last=Berger|first=Peter|publisher=Ethics and Public Policy Center|others=|year=1999|isbn=978-0802846914|location=Washington, D.C.|page=2|oclc=41445734}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former proponent of the earlier secularization thesis, Peter Berger, has now expressed his support for the newer theory, stating that the "world today... is as furiously religious as it ever was.”&lt;ref name="Berger_page2"/&gt; 

== Background ==
Many scholars of the 19th century posited that the world was undergoing a process of [[secularization]]. Individuals such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud believed that this trend would continue until religion became essentially insignificant in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion in the contemporary world : a sociological introduction|last=Aldridge|first=Alan|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780745653464|edition= Third|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=Chapter 4|oclc=812687263}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the least it was believed that religion would become "privatized."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The sociological imagination|last=Mills|first=Charles Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780199761128|location=Oxford [England]|pages=33|oclc=610027153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secularization thesis was underscored by [[rationalism]], an argument born from the Enlightenment Era.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Canopy : Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion.|last=L.|first=Berger, Peter|date=2011|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1306601580|oclc=877050176}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Norris and Inglehart, the traditional view of 19th century secularization can be divided into two perspectives (1) 'Demand-Side theories' and (2) 'Supply Side Theories.'&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and secular : religion and politics worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Inglehart, Ronald.|year=2011|isbn=9781139128674|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=Chapter 1|oclc=767732041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Demand Side' theories ===
Demand Side theories of secularization insist that the phenomenon occurs "bottom up," such that as a whole, the general population will become increasingly rational independent of any influence from the secular government or religious leadership body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Examples of Demand Side theories can be found in the accounts given by Weber and Durkheim. Whilst Weber rarely actually used the term "secularization," he is generally given credit for alluding to the idea that religion was gradually losing its prominence in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism|last=1864-1920.|first=Weber, Max|date=2008|publisher=BN Publishing|others=Parsons, Talcott, 1902-1979,, Tawney, R. H. (Richard Henry), 1880-1962.|isbn=9781607960980|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=657328726}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weber, the world was initially seen as unified such that religion, politics and economics all existed on the same social plane, meaning that the term "religion" was actually not necessary nor was it widely used because it was encompassed in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughey|first=Michael W.|date=1979|title=The idea of secularization in the works of max weber: A theoretical outline|journal=Qualitative Sociology|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=85–111|doi=10.1007/bf02390135|issn=0162-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weber, when different aspects of society such as politics and economics became severed from religion, this started an inevitable demise such that religion would become extinct in the public sphere.

=== 'Supply Side' theories ===
Supply Side theories of secularization argue that the demand for religion exerted by the general population remains constant. This means that any change in the religious landscape occurs as a result of the manipulation of the "supply market" by religious leaders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The construction therefore views the phenomenon as 'top down' development. Bruce argues that the "supply" of religion is greatest when there is a "free" and "competitive" market for "providers" of religion, as in most Western nations, as opposed to states where one religion predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is Dead: Secularization in the West|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=9780631232759|location=|pages=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Sociology Literature ==

=== Terminology and Definition ===
The term "Desecularization" appears in the title of Peter Berger's seminal work ''The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics.'' According to Karpov, the term has received little analysis in the field of sociology,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=V.|date=2010-03-01|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcs/article/52/2/232/781896|journal=Journal of Church and State|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=232–270, 232|doi=10.1093/jcs/csq058|issn=0021-969X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this section will refer to at least one significant development in the term’s definition since its first use. '' ''

Berger explains that the assumption that the modern world is secular has been “falsified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Desecularization of the World|last=Berger|first=Peter|publisher=The Ethics and Public Policy Centre|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington, D. C.|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article online, he acknowledges that his original use of the term simply referred to “the continuing strong presence of religion in the modern world.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/05/13/desecularization/|title=Desecularization - The American Interest|date=2015-05-13|work=The American Interest|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karpov has since developed the definition of the term, which Berger subsequently affirmed. Karpov defines the term as referring to a phenomenon that is counter-secularization and thus is reactionary to a prior period of secularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=Vyacheslav|date=|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|jstor=23921866|journal=Journal of Church and State|volume=52|pages=237|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that Desecularization can be defined as "the growth of religion's societal influence," but only if it develops in response to "previously secularizing trends."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, Karpov's development of the term essentially limited the definition to instances where religion was actively re-established as opposed to simply a state of continuity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Methodological concerns ===
Some scholars raise the issue of evidence. Karpov for example, mounts a discussion on the different analytics that can be used in providing evidence for desecularizing trends.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=Vyacheslav|date=2010|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|jstor=23921866|journal=Journal of Church and State|volume=52|pages=259–263|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divides these analytics into two different types of evidence, (1) societal-level data or "macro-data" and (2) non-societal data, named in Karpov’s article as “mega data." Macro-data deals with evidence obtained from individual societal “units.” These units cannot exclusively be referred to as countries or nation-states because sometimes they can represent smaller sections, i.e. racial groups. Other data ("mega-data") is less objective according to Karpov, because it often refers to trends in more abstract terms such as in “modern society” or civilization generally.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Essentially, mega-date data attempts to identify patterns on a more cosmic or global scale, whereas macro data can be very specific to nations, cities and racial groups such as church attendance and census results.  

Because the term Desecularization has been used to describe a global trend,&lt;ref name="Berger_page2" /&gt; the question raised by Karpov is whether macro-data analytics can be considered as valid when they indicate specific trends in “societal units,” rather than global trends.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are two primary critiques of macro analytics: (1) that it leads to “methodological nationalism,” causing a fixation on nation-states rather than broader civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Globalization|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|publisher=Polity Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Malden|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next argument is that of (2) temporal limitation – the concern that because our current concept of “society” is relatively recent, a focus on societal-level analytics (macro data) restricts sociological analysis to modernity and no other time period. According to Karpov this poses an issue when considering religions with ancient historical trajectories.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Karpov also cites several implications that result from using “mega” analytics, overall suggesting that it can allow for an understanding of desecularization that is rooted both in its historical trajectory, and its presence in modernity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He concludes that whilst “macro” data can limit the analysis of desecularization, it can be compounded and used in conjunction with “mega” analytics to give sociologists a clear overall picture of a religious trend. 

== Examples ==

=== Church attendance in America ===
Finke and Stark state that church attendance in America from 1776 to 2000 has in fact increased from 17% of the population to 62% of the population.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Churching of America|last=Finke|first=Roger|last2=Stark|first2=Rodney|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Brunswick|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the religious landscape in the 20th and 21st centuries only appear to be fading in significance because traditional routes of religious worship are being replaced by new wave religiosity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, they claim that populations in the modern world are moving away from traditional or established denominations such as Catholicism and participating in religious affairs in a more individualized sense.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, Finke and Stark argue that the colonial period in America was not as religious as once thought, using church attendance as an indicator of religiosity. Instead they suggest that the onset of globalization and religious pluralism is responsible for a higher proportion of church involvement when compared with the monolithic, traditional histories of the mainstream churches.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Globalization?|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|publisher=Polity Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Malden|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orthodox Christianity in Russia ===
Christopher Marsh explains the secularization in Russia before the collapse of the Soviet Union, stating that the regime was underscored by “scientific atheism,” which was ultimately manifested in the persecution of religious clergy in Russia throughout the duration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and the state in Russia and China : suppression, survival, and revival|last=1969-|first=Marsh, Christopher|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441102294|location=New York|pages=175|oclc=641998840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secularization was indicated in the surveys conducted between 1981 and 1990, that showed a sharp decline in religious and supernatural beliefs, particularly in young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Yves|date=2006|title=Trends in Religious Feeling in Europe and Russia|url=|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|volume=47|pages=99–129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lambert's study, 12 variables were used in the survey to denote religiosity, which included propensity to pray, belief in an afterlife etc. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Evans and Northmore-Ball, 80 percent of individuals claimed to be Russian Orthodox in 2007, with only half of the population doing the same in 1993, immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Geoffrey|last2=Northmore-Ball|first2=Ksenia|date=2012|title=The Limits of Secularization? The Resurgence of Orthodoxy in Post-Soviet Russia|url=|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=51|pages=799|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Berger and Karpov use this evidence to bolster their accounts of Desecularization in the present.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Desecularization in East Asia ===
Zeng discusses the increasingly religious paradigm within civil service entrance examinations - tests which are intended to sort applicants for civil service and "justify social hierarchy," as well as academic examinations for school and university.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Kangmin|date=1996|title=Prayer, Luck, and Spiritual Strength: The Desecularization of Entrance Examination|url=|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=40|pages=264–279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study uses [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence and interviews with civil servants to provide evidence for this phenomenon. Zeng highlights the systemic use of ''emas'' - prayer symbols that are used in Shintoism and other East-Asian religions, to invoke positive outcomes in entrance exams. According to Zeng, these are sufficiently prevalent in some parts of Japan such that individual universities such as Keio University in Tokyo, offer their own prayer templates for prospective students.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Zeng also found that in two separate non-academic shrines in Japan, more than half of the ''emas'' were directed toward such exams.            

== The Debate ==
So far this article has suggested that The Secularization Thesis was the sociological predecessor of Desecularization, which is a more contemporary sociological theory. However, the secularization-desecularization dichotomy is still surrounded by much debate in regards to its application to modernity. Some contemporary scholars in the 20th and 21st century have argued that the Secularization Thesis is not nullified and that the term 'desecularization' can only be applied in isolated, societal circumstances. Wilson has suggested that commercialism continues to undermine religion in relation to religious bodies such as the Church, and non-religious bodies such as the family unit and economic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Companion to Sociology of Religion|last=Wilson|first=Bryan|last2=Fenn|first2=RK (ed.)|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=Part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of the contemporary theory of desecularization such as Wilson, still concede that religiosity is not trending towards extinction because of continued religious piety across the globe. However, they do argue that its relationship with political and economic institutions is indeed subject to a continued decline because of the increased pressure from the scientific and technological spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=207–223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue not only that this proposition is plausible in modernity, but that it still compatible with 19th century conceptions of Secularization that foreshadowed its "privatization," if not extinction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, critics of Desecularization suggest that whilst it can account for some instances of continued and revised religiosity, it does not adequately describe the relationship between religion and privatized inquisitions and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Mouzelis suggests that this case is "strong," however it only refers to "inter-institutional" secularization (i.e. the relationship between religion and other institutions).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=211–213|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the opinion that the argument against Desecularization becomes weakened when one considers "developments within the religious sphere proper," or what he calls, "intra-institutional" secularization.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Similarly, Martin uses evidence of increased [[Pentecostalism]] in both developed and non-developed countries (particularly the U.S) to bolster the argument for Desecularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Secularization: Towards a Revised General Theory|last=Martin|first=D|publisher=Ashgate|year=2005|isbn=|location=Aldershot|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce offers a rebuttal to this point, claiming that The United States is simply slower to become secular due to certain structural predispositions, namely the steady rate of migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secularization: In Defense of an Unfashionable Theory|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=180–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bruce also suggests that the dramatic changes to religiosity in the modern world such as increased liberalism, represent evidence of its decline. According to Bruce, this trajectory could have begun with the transition from medieval Catholicism to the Protestant reformation under Martin Luther.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secularization: In Defense of an Unfashionable Theory|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis describes this as a potentially weak argument in that most proponents of Desecularization would simply view events such as the Reformation as a religious development or the birth of a new type of Christianity, which could have the potential to further globalize its consumption.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  

Among these dramatic changes in religion, according to Bruce, is the deterioration of supernatural elements of religiosity, leaving behind a belief system that its more morally grounded a development which represents a "retardation" of religion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Again, Mouzelis takes a more objective stance, suggesting that this development can be seen as both evidence for and against Desecularization because such movements can still capitulate the globalization of certain faiths.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;   

Overall, critics of desecularization tend to argue that whilst religious enthusiasm is not necessarily in decline, the significance of religion in the public sphere, and as a limb of political and economic institutions, is indeed continually diminished by modernity. This can be described as the "privatization" of religion. However, desecularization proponents tend to suggest that these aforementioned changes represent religious developments rather than religious declines, and therefore cannot be used as evidence of general secularizing trend.

The '''Edict of Milan''' ({{lang-la|Edictum Mediolanense}}) was the February 313 AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;Frend, W. H. C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Western Roman Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], who controlled the Balkans, met in [[Milan]] and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt; following the [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] issued two years earlier in [[Serdica]]. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity a legal status, but did not make Christianity the [[State church of the Roman Empire]]; this took place under Emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 380 AD with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

The document is found in [[Lactantius]]' ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' and in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s [[Church History (Eusebius)|''History of the Church'']] with marked divergences between the two.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"&gt;Cross and Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' 1974 art. '''Milan, Edict of.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'&amp;thinsp; is debated by some.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict.&lt;ref name="ODCC-EoM"/&gt; It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.&lt;ref name="Frend"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ImperialpalaceMilan.jpg|thumb|300 px|Remains of the Imperial palace of Mediolanum (Milan). The imperial palace (built in large part by [[Maximian]], colleague of [[Diocletian]]) was a large complex with several buildings, gardens, and courtyards, used for the Emperor's private and public activities, and for his court, family, and imperial bureaucracy.]]
Ever since the fall of the [[Severan dynasty]] in 235 AD, rivals for the imperial throne had bid for support by either favouring or [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecuting Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Frend, W.H.C. ''The Early Church'' SPCK 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The previous [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] had been recently issued by the emperor [[Galerius]] from [[Serdica]] and was posted at [[Nicomedia]] on 30 April 311. By its provisions, the Christians, who had "followed such a caprice and had fallen into such a folly that they would not obey the institutes of antiquity", were granted an indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wherefore, for this our indulgence, they ought to pray to their God for our safety, for that of the republic, and for their own, that the commonwealth may continue uninjured on every side, and that they may be able to live securely in their homes.}}

Their confiscated property, however, was not restored until 313, when instructions were given for the Christians' meeting places and other properties to be returned and compensation paid by the state to the current owners:&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.}}

It directed the provincial magistrates to execute this order at once with all energy so that public order may be restored and the continuance of divine favour may "preserve and prosper our successes together with the good of the state."

The actual letters have never been retrieved. However, they are quoted at length in [[Lactantius]]' ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors'' (''De mortibus persecutorum''), which gives the Latin text of both Galerius's Edict of Toleration as posted at Nicomedia on 30 April 311 and of Licinius's letter of toleration and restitution addressed to the governor of Bithynia and posted at Nicomedia on 13 June 313.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De mortibus persecutorum'' 34.1–35.1, 48.1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eusebius]] of Caesarea translated both documents into Greek in his ''History of the Church'' (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''). His version of the letter of Licinius must derive from a copy posted in the province of [[Palaestina Prima]] (probably at its capital, [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]]) in the late summer or early autumn of 313, but the origin of his copy of Galerius's Edict of 311 is unknown since that does not seem to have been promulgated in Caesarea. In his description of the events in Milan in his ''[[Life of Constantine]]'', Eusebius eliminated the role of Licinius, whom he portrayed as the evil foil to his hero Constantine.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Edict was in effect directed against [[Maximinus Daia]], the Caesar in the East who was at that time styling himself as Augustus. Having received the emperor Galerius' instruction to repeal the persecution in 311, Maximinus had instructed his subordinates to desist, but had not released Christians from prisons or virtual death-sentences in the mines, as Constantine and Licinius had both done in the West.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"&gt;Inscription printed in Stevenson, J. ''A New Eusebius'' SPCK 1965, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Galerius' death, Maximin was no longer constrained; he enthusiastically took up renewed persecutions in the eastern territories under his control, encouraging petitions against Christians. One of those petitions, addressed not only to Maximin but also to Constantine and Licinius, is preserved in a stone inscription at Arycanda in Lycia, and is a "request that the Christians, who have long been disloyal and still persist in the same mischievous intent, should at last be put down and not be suffered by any absurd novelty to offend against the honour due to the gods."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, J. 1965, p. 297"/&gt;

The Edict is popularly thought to concern only Christianity, and even to make Christianity the official religion of the Empire (which recognition did not actually occur until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380). Indeed, the Edict expressly grants religious liberty not only to Christians, who had been the object of special persecution, but goes even further and grants liberty to all religions:

{{quote|text=When you see that this has been granted to [Christians] by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship for the sake of the peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity of any religion.|sign="Edict of Milan"|source=Lactantius, ''On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De Mortibus Persecutorum)'', ch. 48. opera, ed. 0. F. Fritzsche, II, p 288 sq. (''Bibl Patr. Ecc. Lat.'' XI).&lt;ref&gt;And similarly in [http://wadsworth.com/history_d/special_features/ilrn_legacy/wawc1c01c/content/wciv1/readings/eusebius.html Eusebius].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since Licinius composed the Edict with the intent of publishing it in the east{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} upon his hoped-for victory over Maximinus, it expresses the religious policy accepted by Licinius, a pagan, rather than that of Constantine{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}, who was already a Christian. Constantine's own policy went beyond merely tolerating Christianity: he tolerated paganism and other religions, but he actively promoted Christianity.

==Religious statement==
Although the Edict of Milan is commonly presented as Constantine’s first great act as a Christian emperor, it is disputed whether the Edict of Milan was an act of genuine faith. The document could be seen as Constantine's first step in creating an alliance with the Christian God, who he considered the strongest deity.&lt;ref&gt;Sordi, Marta. ''The Christians and the Roman Empire.'' Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994. p134.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was concerned about social stability and the protection of the empire from the wrath of the Christian God: in this view, the Edict could be a pragmatic political decision rather than a religious shift. However, the majority of historians believe that Constantine's conversion to Christianity was genuine, and that the Edict of Milan was merely the first official act of Constantine as a dedicated Christian. This view is supported by Constantine's ongoing favors on behalf of Christianity during the rest of his reign. &lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L. ''Eusebius: The Church History''. Grand Rapids: Kegel Publications, 1999. p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Edict of Milan required that the wrong done to the Christians be righted as thoroughly as possible; it claims “it has pleased us to remove all conditions whatsoever.”&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"&gt;"Paul Halsall, “Galerius and Constantine: Edicts of Toleration 311/313,” Fordham University; [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/edict-milan.asp Fordham.edu]; Internet, accessed 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The edict further demanded that individual Romans right any wrongs towards Christians, claiming that “the same shall be restored to the Christians without payment or any claim of recompense and without any kind of fraud or deception.” These provisions indicate that more than just the establishment of justice was intended. After demanding the immediate return of what was lost by the Christians, the edict states that this should be done so that “public order may be secured”, not for the intrinsic value of justice or the glory of God.&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt; The exhortation to urgently right wrongs reflects the leaders' desires to avoid unfavorable consequences, which in this case included social unrest and further conquests. Constantine was superstitious and believed enough in the existence of the non-Christian gods to not want to offset the balance of good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yuri Koszarycz |title=Constantinian Christianity |publisher=The Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies |url=http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |website=The-orb.net |access-date=14 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215120014/http://www.the-orb.net/textbooks/eccles/constantine.html |archivedate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that, the sooner this balance was restored by the Romans establishing a state of justice with the Christians, the sooner the state would become stable.

This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]'s [[coregency]] marked the end of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the reign of [[James II of England]]. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious [[paradigm]] of 17th-century England, which was [[Roman Catholic]] when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the "vile pop'ry" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of [[Protestant]] liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacCubbin |first1=Robert P. |last2=Hamilton-Phillips |first2=Martha |last3=College of William and Mary|last4=Grolier Club|last5=Folger Shakespeare Library|date=1990 |title=The Age of William III &amp; Mary II: Power, Politics and Patronage, 1688-1702 : A Reference Encyclopedia and Exhibition Catalogue |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |isbn=0962208108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant copies of the ballad are available at [[Magdelene College]] in the [[Pepys Library]].

==Synopsis==
Set to the tune of "Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EBBA|title=Recording of ''England's Triumph'' sung to the tune of ''Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar''|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20887/recording|website=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ballad opens with an [[encomium]] directed toward King William III: "Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation." The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is "seated on the throne": "The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the "[[Whore of Babylon|Babylonian Dame]]" mentioned in these lines, was [[English Reformation|once again no longer the official religion of England]]. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: "May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing."

==Form==
The ballad is broken up into eight [[:wikt:octet|octets]] with varying [[rhyme scheme]]s. For instance, the first stanza has an ''AA BB CCC B'' rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an ''AAA B CCC B'' rhyme scheme.

[[Ethics]] involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ethics is "the good life", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional [[Morality|moral]] conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1993) ''Practical Ethics'', 2nd edition (p.10), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[religion]]s have an [[ethics|ethical]] component, often derived from purported supernatural [[revelation]] or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who "would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist ethics==
{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}
Ethics in [[Buddhism]] are traditionally based on the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in [[Buddhist scriptures]] or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]]: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see [[vinaya]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the ''vinaya'', but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the [[Middle Way]]) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity'' (Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has observed:
:"Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the "immeasurables" — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (1994). For other examples of Buddhist discourses that promote ethical behaviors among laity see, for instance, the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] (referred to as "the [[Vinaya]] of the householder" by [[Buddhaghosa]]) and the [[Dhammika Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Christian ethics}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Mount|The New Commandment|Ministry of Jesus}}

Christian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly [[Virtuous#Christian tradition|virtuous]] in both thought and deed, see also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from [[vice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Christian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the [[Bible]]. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will.  God's will can be summed up by the precept: "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself", commonly called the [[Great Commandment]]. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society.  Christian ethics has a [[teleological]] aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the [[Kingdom of God]]—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the [[Old Testament]]’s [[Ten Commandments]], and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Christian ethics is not substantially different from [[Jewish ethics]], except in the exhortation to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It has been argued (see [[Ched Myers]]'s ''Binding the Strong Man'', and [[John Howard Yoder]]'s ''The Politics of Jesus'') that Jesus was waging a [[Nonviolent revolution|non-violent campaign]] against the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Roman oppressors]] and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--[[turn the other cheek]], go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.

Other tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13}}). Other schema include the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] and the [[Seven virtues]]. For more see [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

==Confucian ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Confucianism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or [[situational ethics]]. The Confucian system differs very strongly from [[Kantian ethics]] in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in [[Zhou Dynasty]] China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of [[Mozi]] argued for universal love ({{Zh|s=兼爱|p=jiān ài}}). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that [[Mao Zedong]] was more Confucian than Communist.
Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by [[Mencius]] ({{Zh|s=孟子|p=mèng zĭ}}), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) "acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses [[honesty]] above all. His concepts of [[lĭ]] ({{Zh|s=理}}), [[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]] ({{Zh|s=義}}), and [[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]] ({{Zh|s=仁}}) can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty ({{Zh|s=誠|p=[[chéng]]|l=[[sincerity]]}}) and [[fidelity]] ({{Zh|s=孝|p=[[xiào]]}}) to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid [[property rights]], hard to distinguish from any other [[dictatorship]]. Traditional ethics had been perverted by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]].

===Buddhist influence===
Buddhism, and specifically [[Mahayana Buddhism]], brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the [[Tang dynasty]], and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Daoist ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Laozi]] (Lao Tzu) and other [[Daoist|Taoist]] (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' 禮), culture (''[[Chinese culture|wen]]'' 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater ''sense of being'' and less identification with ''the act of''  ''doing''.  Taoist ''passivity'' nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows ''the majestic'' and ''the real'' to shine, which influences society for the better.    - "If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.  Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."   - Lao Tzu

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};

Ethics that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K.

The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The Persian historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 1), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000130.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter VII], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), page 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; These correspond to five ''[[Yamas]]'' of ancient Hindu ethics: [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Satya]] (truth, non-falsehood), [[Asteya]] (non-stealing), [[Brahmacharya]] (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and [[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness).&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Andrea Hornett (2012), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and Forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-642-32445-1}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-78&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as ''[[Niyamas]]'': ''[[Shaucha|Śauca]]'' (purity in body, speech and mind), ''Santosha'' (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (perseverance, meditation, austerity), ''Swadhyaya'' (lifelong learning) and ''Pranidhan'' (right attitude, contemplation).&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) ''Gunas'' that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) ''Purushartha'' that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness ([[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]]); (3) ''Ashramas'' that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) ''Varnasramas'' that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wfg&gt;William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes:&lt;ref name=agw/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept,&lt;ref name=wfg2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Fall, 2002), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, pages 87-96, 111-114, 131-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Reichenbach (1988), The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

==Islamic ethics==
{{Main|Islamic ethics}}{{See also|Halal|Haram}}
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as [[John Kelsay]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Ethics'' phrases, "ultimately points to the reality of God." Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]], or the sayings of Muhammad) {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;''Islamic ethics'', Encyclopedia of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "ignorance."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Macho|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility.  A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth.  Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster.  And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice.  Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.”  (Quran 31:18-19)

Muslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand.  Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations.  It is universal in its scope and in its applicability.  Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits.  Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue.  They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them.  In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:

“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him  who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”

==Jewish ethics==
{{Main|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the [[Oral Torah]] both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with [[ethics]] is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Mishnah|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'', popularly translated as ''Ethics of the Fathers''. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]], and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal ([[halakhic]]) portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature.  This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early [[Christian]] tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of [[IV Maccabees]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], and [[Philo]].

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the [[Wisdom literature]] shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view [[Ben Sira]]'s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from [[Hasidean]] circles in the [[Maccabean]] time, such as are contained in [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], especially in Chapter IV. Here the first [[ethical will]] or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the [[Golden Rule]], "Do that to no man which thou hatest!" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the [[Book of Enoch|Ethiopic Enoch]] (xciv. et seq.) and the [[Slavonic Enoch]] (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, [[idolatry]], [[murder]], and [[incest]], were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] these [[Noachide Laws]] were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]], including followers of both [[Asatru]] and [[Theodism]], try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples ([[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]]) through the form of the [[Nine Noble Virtues]].

==Scientology ethics==
{{Main|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology ethics is based upon the concepts of [[good and evil]]. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Morality without religion}} {{See also|Secular ethics}}
Secular ethics is a [[moral philosophy]] in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including [[consequentialism]], [[freethinking]], [[humanism]], [[secular humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]], among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of [[natural rights]] and [[social contract]]s, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianesque]] [[ethical intuitionism]] or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with [[Occam's razor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Approaches such as [[ethical egoism]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral skepticism]], and [[moral nihilism]] are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==
Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the "desirable and required order".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt; Shinto adherents are to "realize and carry out the will of the ''kami'' and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt;

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for "blessings of the ''kami''", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"/&gt;

==Wiccan ethics==
{{Main|Wiccan morality}}
Wiccan morality is largely based on the [[Wiccan Rede]]: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean "do no harm at all", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, Judy (1985) [http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm "Exegesis on the Rede"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QgCzLc0I?url=http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |date=2007-07-28 }} in ''[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]]'' vol. 5, Number 3 ([[Oimelc]] 1985). Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Threefold Return]], which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''High Magic's Aid'', London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in [[Doreen Valiente]]'s ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] &amp; [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]], ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; these being [[Gladness|mirth]], [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]], [[honour]], [[humility]], strength, [[beauty]], [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[compassion]]. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

==Projects and Goals==
In 2006 the FIIRD published a boxed set of the three Holy Books, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Holy Qur'an.

Another goal of the FIIRD, strongly supported by the [[Levant Foundation]], was to create a post-doctoral program at the [[University of Geneva]] in the field of interreligious and intercultural dialogue whereby several Fellows, each possessing a PhD in theology, philosophy, history or other humanities and dedicated to further their knowledge and understanding of the monotheistic religions, participate in approved research and publish their results all done with the goal of searching for peace between the Abrahamistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

'''''Freedom of Worship''''' or '''''Freedom to Worship''''' is the second of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' oil paintings produced by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]] enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in his [[State of the Union Address]] delivered on January 6, 1941.  Rockwell considered this painting and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' the most successful of the series. ''Freedom of Worship'' was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an essay by philosopher [[Will Durant]].

==Background==
''Freedom of Worship'' is the second of a series of four oil paintings by [[Norman Rockwell]] entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''. The works were inspired by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, known as [[Four Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=April 11, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the [[United States Constitution]] are [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=October 10, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' World War II policy statement, the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', accompanied by essays from noted writers: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).&lt;ref name=NRFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814161913/http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=The Countryman Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the essay accompanying ''Freedom of Worship'', ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', coauthored with his wife, [[Ariel Durant]]. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the [[Series E bond|U.S. Government War Bond]] Drive.&lt;ref name=AASfaWP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63|title= Art/Architecture; Salve for a Wounded People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 2001|author=Marling, Karal Ann|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415212052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63 |archivedate = April 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ILTPP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK102&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote box|width=27em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world."|source=—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]]}}
The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with [[Kippah|his head covered]] carrying a religious book who is [[American Jews|Jewish]], an older woman who is [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]], and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding [[rosary beads]] who is [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; In 1966, Rockwell used ''Freedom of Worship'' to show his admiration for [[John F. Kennedy]] in a ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' story illustration entitled ''JFK's Bold Legacy''. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to ''Freedom of Worship'' along with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Freedom of Worship original draft.jpg|thumb|The original draft of ''Freedom of Worship'' was set in a barbershop.]]
The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Solomon, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; His first workup was a {{convert|41|×|33|in|cm|adj=on}} oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services.&lt;ref name=C311&gt;Claridge, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like.&lt;ref name=HaK100&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should.&lt;ref name=C311-2&gt;Claridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Solomon, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,&lt;ref name=AASfaWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK96&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Solomon, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the ''Post'' was worried about Rockwell's progress on the ''Four Freedoms'' and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on ''Freedom of Worship'', his second painting in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942)&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His [[Arlington, Vermont]], neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary,&lt;ref name=M128&gt;Meyer, pp. 128–33.&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was actually Protestant of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center).&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with ''The Post'' who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his [[fez (hat)|fez]], was too obviously foreign to offend."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;  The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns.  The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.&lt;ref name="HaK102"/&gt;

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to ''Freedom of Worship'', "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over."&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;

==Critical review==
''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs said of ''Speech'' and ''Worship'', "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The ''Four Freedoms'' did&amp;nbsp;— and do."&lt;ref name="MaM 59"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it."&lt;ref name="MaM 69"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell believed that ''Freedom of Worship'' and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' were his better results in the series.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; [[Laura Claridge]] has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Thirteen Articles of Faith]]'' by [[Joseph Smith]]."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published.&lt;ref name=MaM50/&gt; The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqOopdewZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Blueprint for Judicial Reform|author1=McGuian, Patrick B. |author2=Rader, Randall R.|isbn=978-0-942522-08-2|pages=301–5|publisher=The Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in ''Freedom of Religion''.&lt;ref name=ILTPP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|date=June 21, 1943|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claridge feels that &lt;blockquote&gt;the tight amalgam of faces&amp;nbsp;... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking.&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.&lt;ref name=MaM50&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]] considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic".&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;  Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/bio_1706.html|title=Maureen Hart Hennessey|accessdate=June 29, 2014|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive.&lt;ref name=HaK100/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."&lt;ref name="FSP"/&gt;

'''Girls of Enghelab Street''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: دختران خیابان انقلاب) is a series of protests against [[Hijab by country#Iran|compulsory hijab]] in Iran. The protests were inspired by '''Vida Movahed''' ({{lang-fa|ویدا موحد}}), an Iranian woman known as the '''Girl of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختر خیابان انقلاب}}), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the [[Enqelab Street|Enghelab Street]] (Revolution Street) of [[Tehran]] on 28 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; She was arrested on that day&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; and was released temporary on bail&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com_1"/&gt; a month later, on 28 January 2018.&lt;ref name="NasrinSotoudeh_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk_1"/&gt; Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on [[Masih Alinejad]]'s call for [[White Wednesdays]], a protest movement that the presenter at [[VOA-PNN|VOA Persian Television]] started in early 2017.&lt;ref name="globalvoices.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl.org_2"/&gt; Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the "Girls of Enghelab Street"&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt; and "The Girls Of Revolution Street"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/in-tehran-new-hijab-protester-led-off-by-police/4635838.html&lt;/ref&gt; in English sources. Some of the protesters claim that they didn't follow Masih Alinejad's call.&lt;ref name="en.radiofarda.com_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asriran.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tasnimnews.com_1"/&gt;

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==
{{see|Theocracy#Iran}}
In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic revolution]], article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]].&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_638_iran_law"/&gt; Fines are recalculated in the courts as the value of Iranian rials drops every year since 1979.

Article 639 of the same book says, two type of people shall be sentenced to one year to 10 years imprisonment, first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_639_iran_law"/&gt;

These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rudaw.net_1"/&gt;

== Background ==
Before the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 (during the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran) the hijab was not compulsory,&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or [[chador]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamian"/&gt;

After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; In 1979, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] announced that women should observe Islamic dress code;&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;

In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President [[Hassan Rouhani]], showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com_1"/&gt; The report was released by the [[Center for Strategic Studies]], the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" on July 2014 in a PDF format.&lt;ref name="css.ir_1"/&gt;

On 2 February 2018 a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Most Iranians feel Trump’s comments in support of protesters didn’t help, poll finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|website=washingtonpost|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.&lt;ref name="firstpost.com_1"/&gt; For example, in January 2018, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Gnostic saints''' are a series of historical figures revered in [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] as celebrated in several Gnostic Christian churches. One such list of saints appears in the Collect of the Day of All Gnostic Saints of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], which reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Praise be to Thee, O Father of all Fatherhood, Thou, the unknown God, who was before the fall of the sparks into the darkness of this aeon, for the glorious messengers of the light of Thy everlasting and redeeming Gnosis. Especially do we praise and thank Thee today for the following holy and enlightened teachers and knowers of truth: Valentinus of Rome; Basilides of Antioch; Carpocrates of Alexandria; Bardesanes of Syria; Mani of Babylonia, Martyr; Priscillian of Avila, Bishop and Martyr; Paul of Samosata, Bishop; Peter of Bruys, Martyr; Amalric of Bena; David of Dinan and William of Paris; Bogomil of Dragowitza, Bishop; Peter Waldo of Lyons; Joachim of Flora; Esclaremonde de Foix and the Cathar martyrs; and all the holy souls and wise sages who have in any way or form, under whatsoever guise and appearance attained to and taught the true and ancient Gnosis of God. Grant, O Boundless One, that inspired by and following their most noble example we also may see the light of Thy Gnosis and assist in liberating Thy sparks of light from the chains of darkness, ignorance and malice which afflict them in this aeon. 
Amen."&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesia Gnostica. [http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/lect162.htm Meditations: Day of All Gnostic Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''God Makes the Rivers to Flow''''' is an anthology of spiritual texts for use in meditation, assembled by [[Eknath Easwaran]]. Condensed versions have been published under the titles '''''Timeless Wisdom''''' (book) and '''''Sacred Literature of the World''''' (audio recording). First published as a book in the US in 1982, progressively enlarged or revised versions of ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' were also issued in the US in 1991, 2003, and 2009. English editions have been published in India, and a French edition&lt;ref name=french97/&gt;&lt;ref name=PUBPAGEforeign&gt;[http://www.easwaran.org/non-us-editions-of-nilgiri-press-books-by-language.html Non-US editions of Nilgiri Press Books, by Language] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414201234/http://www.easwaran.org/non-us-editions-of-nilgiri-press-books-by-language.html |date=14 April 2013 }}, accessed 21 Sep 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; has been published.

and utilized in research studies&lt;ref name=oman-richards08/&gt; and education.&lt;ref name=oman-flinders08/&gt;

==Background==
For nearly four decades, [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran]] taught a method of meditation, known as [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]], which involves focusing the mind on inspiring sacred texts, such as the ''[[Psalm 23|23rd Psalm]]'' or the Buddha's ''[[Metta Sutta|Discourse on Good Will]]''. Throughout this time, he received inquiries about whether various texts were suitable passages for meditation. He taught that  passages should meet the criteria he had learned to trust in his own practice: a passage should be "positive, practical, universal, and inspiring".&lt;ref name=gmrf2009&gt;''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} and drawn from a scripture or a person whose words and life attest to spiritual realization. ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' grew as a collection of such passages.

==Topics covered==
All US editions of ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' and its derivatives contain an introduction, plus numerous 1- to 3- or more page selections of spiritual texts from many traditions. Examples of spiritual texts are shown in the table at right.

[[File:Guruvayoor Kesavan Statue-sidecrop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.40|alt=Statue of devout elephant|[[Guruvayur Keshavan|Statue of devout elephant]]&lt;ref&gt;This is a photograph of a statue of [[Guruvayur Keshavan]], an elephant who lived the last 54 years of his life, until 1976, at [[Guruvayur Temple]] in Kerala state, India. The elephant was reported to display many signs of devotion to God. See [http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/11/stories/2005121102861000.htm "'Guruvayur Keshavan' Remembered"] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', Sunday, 11 Dec 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran's]] Introduction uses a sculptural metaphor&lt;ref&gt;The elephant is used as both a [[metaphor]] (e.g., "once we have become attentive to the presence of this true self, then all we really need do is resolutely chip away whatever is not divine in ourselves," p. 16) and a [[simile]] (e.g., "we wouldn't use a dull chisel or one meant for wood on a piece of stone, and we should use suitable passages for meditation," p. 21), 2009 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain how passages can be used beneficially in meditation. He tells the story of an ancient Indian sculptor who was renowned for vivid representations of elephants. His secret, the sculptor explained, was that after quarrying a giant rock,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;ldquo;for a long time, I do nothing but observe... and study it from every angle. I focus all my concentration on this task... At first, I see nothing but a huge and shapeless rock... Then slowly, very slowly, I... feel a presentiment... an outline, scarcely discernible, shows itself to me... An elephant is stirring in there!... I now know the one thing I must do:... I must chip away every last bit of stone that is ''not'' elephant. What then remains will be, must be, elephant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;ref name=foralongtime&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4M73NeoQUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=isbn:9781586380380+%22for+a+long+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2eoRTuTkOYzEsAOWzoj8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isbn%3A9781586380380%20%22for%20a%20long%20time%22&amp;f=false Direct link: "For a long time...", page 15, ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Easwaran says, meditation helps us to reveal "our higher self... [a] spark of divinity [that] is to be found in the heart of each human being.... [by] resolutely chip[ping] away whatever is not divine in ourselves."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} This process is neither easy or quick, and "can't be done in a week or by the weak."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} But "whatever our tradition, we are inheritors of straightforward spiritual practices [that] vary a bit from culture to culture... but essentially... are the same."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}} Meditation is the most potent practice, enabling us to "see the lineaments of our true self":&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In meditation, the inspirational passage is the chisel, our concentration is the hammer.... When we use our will to drive the thin edge of the passage deep into consciousness, we get the purchase to pry loose tenacious habits and negative attitudes. The passage, whether it is from the Bhagavad Gita or ''The Imitation of Christ'' or the Dhammapada of the Buddha, has been tempered in the flames of mystical experience...&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Easwaran, "the great principle upon which meditation rests is that we become what we meditate on."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} This, he says, is consistent with our experience that even in everyday life, we are shaped by what occupies our thoughts – for example, if we spend most of our time "studying the market, checking the money rates, evaluating our portfolios, we are going to become money-people."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} Thus, in selecting meditation passages, Easwaran has "aimed for the highest the human being is capable of, the most noble and elevating truths that have ever been expressed on this planet."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}} Indeed,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The test of suitable meditation passages is simply this: Does the passage bear the imprint of deep, personal spiritual experience? Is it the statement of one who went beyond the narrow confines of past conditioning into the unfathomable recesses of the mind, there to begin the great work of transformation?.... whatever lacks this validation by personal experience, however poetic or imaginative... is not suited for use in meditation.&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|21–2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also states that passages should be "life affirming,"&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} and encourages building a varied repertoire of passages that can "guard against overfamiliarity.... [and] match a passage to your particular need at the time."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The 2nd and 3rd  editions contain several supplementary sections:
*A description of 8-point program of [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]] recommended by Easwaran, involving silently and slowly focusing the mind on memorized or previously known passages (6 pages)
*A post-script on the "Message of the Scriptures," describing the goal of meditation as a "deathless state of Self-realization.... the message of every major scripture [and] the testimony of mystics everywhere, East or West."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|256–7}}  (3 pages)
*The author's statement of what he believes separates the book from other sacred literature collections: that it functions as an instrument for transforming one's life. He states he can "testify from my own experience [that the passages] have the power to remake personality in the image of one's highest ideals."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|13}} ("Preface," 1 page)
*Indices by source, title, and first line
*Biographical and bibliographic notes on passage sources

*"Recommended Passages for Specific Uses," which suggests lists of especially helpful passages for particular stages of life (e.g., expectant mothers, caregivers, illness); for building specific positive qualities (e.g., patience, compassion, courage, devotion); or addressing and changing specific negative patterns of thinking (e.g., anger, fear, jealousy, greed).&lt;ref&gt;Not all 2009 categories were present in the 2003 edition's section, which was titled "Using Inspirational Passages to Change Negative Thinking" (pp. 277–281).&lt;/ref&gt; (6 pages)

In ''The International Journal of Humanities &amp; Peace'', Carol Burke wrote that ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' (2003) contains "rich resources" that offer "much to satisfy even the most restless mind."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|113}} In addition to the "vast assortment of inspiring passages,"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|113–4}} the section on using passages for specific purposes is "practical," the biographical notes are "interesting,"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} and the introduction "entertainingly encourages"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} readers to begin personal transformation. Burke states that many passage sources will be familiar, but "many other passages perhaps less familiar, from Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and the [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Native American religion|Native American]] traditions... are equally inspiring."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} She adds that "in this reviewer's opinion, it is regrettable that nothing appears from the eloquent [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] leader [[Chief Joseph]]."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}}

In ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', Marian van Eyk McCain wrote that "it feels refreshingly [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] to see sacred texts from many different [[wisdom tradition]]s gathering peaceably between two covers."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' "contains old favorites like the [[Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace|Prayer of St Francis]]," verses from well-known scriptures, psalms, prayers, poems, two Native American pieces, and selections from "many... individual sages like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard]], [[Thomas à Kempis]] and [[Inayat Khan|Hazrat Inayat Khan]]."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; McCain also warned those "like me" with an aversion to a "preponderance of male pronouns" that "The divine feminine is seriously under-represented here (less than five percent) and only one fifth of the pieces are gender-neutral."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; In response, a letter from a reader, Margaret Purrett, also published by ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', argued that "meditators need to be tolerant of [[metaphor]]s for divinity and gender usage from the past. I would not like to be prevented from enjoying and using the ''Bhagavad Gita'', the ''Vedas'', ''Dhammapada'', or the ''Psalms'' merely because of references to male pronouns. Would anyone?"&lt;ref name=purrett04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margaret Purrett |year=2004 
 |title=Engendering Change [letter commenting on review of God makes the rivers to flow, by Eknath Easwaran] 
 |journal=[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]] |publisher=The Resurgence Trust |volume=14 |issue=226 |pages=60
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Z1vHTdG8NZOksQPRl4i8AQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tGMkAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=resurgence+easwaran&amp;q=easwaran#search_anchor |issn= 0034-5970 |OCLC=1763807}} (letter signed by Margaret Purrett of Voorschoten, The Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Purrett stated that "In fact, [[Eknath Easwaran]] made new translations of many passages to make them more neutral for this last edition, and he changed many of the masculine singulars to neutral plurals."&lt;ref name=purrett04/&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' described the passages in ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' as "positive and practical, inspiring and life-affirming," "alive with the charge of mystical awareness," and having "the power to change your life."&lt;ref name=timesofindia/&gt;

''Prairie Messenger'', a Roman Catholic publication,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Prairie Messenger's'' website states that [http://www.prairiemessenger.ca/About_us.html "True to its Catholic tradition, the Prairie Messenger seeks to mirror for the church on the Prairies the whole reality of the pilgrim People of God as they seek to better understand, make present and judge themselves by the kingdom of God as announced in the liberating and merciful news of Jesus Christ."] (accessed 26 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "these texts should have wide-ranging appeal since they are devoted to catching a glimpse of our inner being. Having taught meditation for over 30 years, Easwaran knows the importance of texts, the discipline of mental training, the use of a mantram, a holy formula, and daily meditation periods.... Easwaran is a faithful guide."&lt;ref name=jwg95/&gt;

{{Eknath Easwaran}}Reviewing the audio edition (1995), ''Fellowship in Prayer'' stated that "There is no end to the beauty that pours forth from the Blue Mountain Meditation Center in California, where Sri Eknath Easwaran continues to weave the golden threads of his ministry."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt; The reviewer described the audio as "magnificent," stating that "the depths of Easwaran's great soul brings each text to its most full expression of beauty and holiness... one has a sense of huge ocean waves rolling slowly, quietly, softly, timelessly, onto a distant shore.... My heart overflows with gratitude."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt;

In ''[[B.C. Catholic]]'s'' review of the audio edition (1995), Paul Matthew St. Pierre stated that "All of them [the passages] are spiritually thrilling both in their content and as read aloud by Easwaran."&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt; St. Pierre stated that "My own position... is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice,"&lt;ref&gt;A fuller version of St. Pierre's statement is: "My own position as an English professor is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice, either from within the text (the voice of author, narrator, or character) or from outside the text (the voice of the reader). This oral dimension of inscribed texts is no more evident than in works that have their origin in oral traditions, such as the scriptures of most of the world's religions. The Hebrew and Christian Scriptures are less a recorded than an authored text, recorded by men and women, but first authored (spoken) by God. Before they came to be recorded, these Scriptures circulated within the Jewish and Christian faith communities, passed on by word of mouth, from generation to generation."&lt;/ref&gt; and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now listened (twice!) to all 170 minutes of readings, I feel confident in stating that this tape will stand up to repeated "hearings" from audiences interested in ecumenical Scriptures and holy books by saints and mystics, and in particular audiences looking for inspiration and dedicated to meditation.&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[New Age Journal]]'' stated that "as an attractive sampler of sacred literature [the book] would be impressive enough. But these passages were chosen... for their [[spiritual transformation|transformative]] power.... The meanings and rhythms of the selections are calming. Their beauty inevitably emanates from their simplicity."&lt;ref name=newage92/&gt;

''India-West'' stated that the book "fills an important void in our lives.... The passages chosen are practical, positive and universal in appeal and of great literary beauty."&lt;ref name=ghosh04/&gt;

''BC Catholic's'' review of the 3rd edition (2003) stated that "This would be a wonderful book to help with one's [[Advent]] preparation and discipline... the book is designed for [[lectio divina]] and meditation.... the book... will fill readers with a sense of wonder, mostly obviously because it collects profoundly inspirational passages... but also because it demands that readers study the passages deferentially, with reverence."&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt; It mentioned many passages as comprising "Catholic content,"&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic content comprises Psalms 23, 24, 100, and 139; [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm's]] 'Teach Me'; Saint [[Symeon the New Theologian]]'s 'I know That He Reveals Himself'; Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 'Prayer of Saint Francis' and Saint [[Clare of Assisi]]'s 'The Mirror of Eternity'; Christ's 'Sermon on the Mount' from the [[Gospel of Saint Matthew]]; 'When You Call' from the [[Book of Isaiah]]; [[St. Paul]]'s '[[1 Corinthians 13|Epistle on Love]]'; St. [[Therese of Liseux]]'s 'Living on Love'; and St. [[Teresa of Avila]]'s 'I Gave All My Heart' and 'Her Heart is Full of Joy.' Other contributions are by Sts. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Brother Lawrence]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]; and by [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Elizabeth of the Trinity]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], [[Thomas a Kempis]], and Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]]." (St. Pierre, 2003, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All the content, from all the faith traditions, in the spirit of ecumenism, is deeply inspirational. For example, the 'Invocations' of Ansari of Herat.... "O Lord, give me that right discrimination / That the lure of the world may cheat me no more. Give me strength / That my faith suffer no eclipse." This prayer evokes not only the penitence of Ramadan (Islam's month of fasting...) but also the preparation and discipline of Advent.&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt;

A '''grave candle''', '''grave lantern''', '''death candle''' or a '''death lantern''' is a type of [[candle]] or [[lantern]], which is lit in memory of the dead or to commemorate solemn events. The form of a lantern is commonly used in [[Christianity]], whereas candles are more common in [[Judaism]] (where they are known as the [[Yahrzeit candle]]).

The tradition has been adopted by Christianity from the earlier [[paganism|pagan]] tradition.&lt;ref name=tvp/&gt;

The grave lanterns, known as ''znicz'', are a common tradition in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=tvp&gt;http://www.tvp.pl/bialystok/aktualnosci/spoleczne/zaduszkowe-tradycje/8984919&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14034">{{NewThought}}
The '''history of [[New Thought]]''' started in the 1830s, with roots in the [[United States]] and [[England]]. As a spiritual movement with roots in [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs, New Thought has helped guide a variety of social changes throughout the 19th, 20th, and into the 21st centuries. Psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] labelled New Thought "the religion of healthy-mindedness" in his study on religion and science, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1902) ''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/wjames/ch04_05.html "The religion of healthy-mindedness"], ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. Retrieved June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newthoughthistory.org/New_Thought_History/Narrative_History.html "Our history"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003085914/http://www.newthoughthistory.org/New_Thought_History/Narrative_History.html |date=2010-10-03 }}. NewThoughtHistory.com. Retrieved June 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roots ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Rooted [[universal science]], early New Thought leaders shared a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] interest between [[metaphysics]] and [[Christianity in the United States|American Christianity]]. In addition to New Thought, [[Christian Science]], [[Transcendental Movement|transcendental movement]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], and other movements were born from similar interests, all in the late 18th and early 19th century. Early New Thought leaders were influenced by [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] belief in the absolute sovereignty of God; [[John Locke]]'s definition of ideas as anything that existed in the mind that could be expressed through words;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Locke's Theory of Knowledge |url=http://wallaceprovost.com/godscience5/gsr7/gsr705.htm |website=WallaceProvost.com |date=2016 |accessdate=September 12, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919204310/http://wallaceprovost.com/godscience5/gsr7/gsr705.htm |archivedate=September 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;and the [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] belief that ideal spirituality "transcends" the physical and is realized only through individual intuition, instead of through religion.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, C.S. (1963) [http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html "A Brief History of The New Thought Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310220040/http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html |date=2012-03-10 }}, ''Spirits In Rebellion.'' Retrieved June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding figures ==

Before anyone practiced New Thought as a set of beliefs there were a few influential figures whose teaching later contributed to the movement. The founder of the 18th century [[The New Church|New Church]], [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], extended clear influence on many authors' New Thought writings on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, G. (2006) ''New Thought, Ancient Wisdom: The History and Future of the New Thought Movement.'' Templeton Foundation Press. p 131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was also influential, as his philosophical movement of [[transcendentalism]] is incorporated throughout New Thought.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, G. (2006) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Mesmer]]'s work on [[hypnosis]] drove the work of Phineas Quimby, who was influenced in part by hearing a lecture by  [[Charles Poyen]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller. (1982) ''Mesmerism and the American Cure of Souls.'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phineas P. Quimby]] is widely recognized as the founder of the New Thought movement. Born in Lebanon, New Hampshire but raised in Belfast, Maine, Quimby learned about the power of the mind to heal through [[hypnosis]] when he observed Charles Poyen's work.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller. (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; About 1840, Quimby began to practice hypnotism, or mesmerism as it was called. Through this practice and further study, he developed the view that illness is a matter of the mind. He opened an office for mental healing in Portland in 1859. 

[[Calvinistic Baptist]] ministerial candidate [[Julius Dresser]] and his future wife [[Annetta G. Seabury]] came from [[Waterville, Maine]] to be healed by Quimby in 1860. They were healed in a short time.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) [http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC "Horatio Willis Dresser"], ''Religious Leaders of America'' 2nd ed. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Dresser and Annetta (his wife by then) began promoting what they called the "Quimby System of Mental Treatment of Diseases" in Boston. Their son [[Horatio Dresser|Horatio]] figures importantly as New Thought's first historian. Horatio, a popular lecturer, edited ''[[The Quimby Manuscripts]]'', which Quimby wrote between 1846 and 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Quimby, P.P. (1921) ''[http://www.ppquimby.com/hdresser/manscpts/manscpt.htm The Quimby Manuscripts]''. Edited by J. Horatio and H. Horatio. Retrieved June 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 [[Mary Baker Eddy]], originally a [[Congregational Church]] member, came to Quimby hoping to be healed from lifelong ill-health. In later years Eddy went on to found [[Christian Science]]. Because of this, while not seen as a New Thought denomination, Christian Science is largely regarded by New Thought followers to be heavily driven by New Thought beliefs. Christian Scientists disagree, frequently stating that Eddy was not influenced by Quimby.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, S. (1973) ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875 Eddy published ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|Science and Health]]'', thus establishing Christian Science as a denomination.

A former [[Methodist]] minister and [[Swedenborgian]] minister named [[Warren Felt Evans|Warren Evans]] came to Quimby for healing in 1863. When he was healed shortly after, he started writing New Thought literature immediately. One source names him as the first person to publish a clear philosophy based on Quimby's practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teahan, J.F. (1979) "Warren Felt Evans and Mental Healing: Romantic Idealism and Practical Mysticism in Nineteenth-Century America", ''Church History. Vol. 48, No. 1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Albanese, Catherine (2016). ''The Spiritual Journals of Warren Felt Evans: from Methodism to Mind Cure'', Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prentice Mulford]] was pivotal in the development of New Thought thinking. From his writings in the White Cross Library, including ''Your Forces and How to Use Them'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Forces and How to Use  Them, Vol. 1|url=https://archive.org/stream/yourforcesandho09mulfgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; the terms "New Thought" and the "[[Law of Attraction (New Thought)|Law of Attraction]]" first came to fruition.

== Movement leaders ==

After the philosophy of New Thought was established, several individuals and organizations rose to prominence to promote the beliefs. However, there is no consensus on who founded the New Thought movement. [[Charles Brodie Patterson]] has been credited. Patterson, a Canadian expatriate who lived in New York City, was labelled the movement's leader when he died in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mount, N.J. and Mount, N. (2005) ''When Canadian literature moved to New York.'' University of Toronto Press, 2005 . p 91.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Eddy's early Christian Science students, [[Ursula Gestefeld]], created a philosophy called the "Science of Being" after Eddy kicked her out of her church. Science of Being groups eventually formed the [[Church of New Thought]] in 1904, which was the first group to refer itself as such.&lt;ref&gt;Braden, C.S. (1963) [http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html "A Brief History of The New Thought Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310220040/http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html |date=2012-03-10 }}, ''Spirits In Rebellion.'' Retrieved June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While Julius Dresser, and later his son Horatio, are sometimes credited as founders of New Thought as a named movement, others share this title. Horatio wrote ''A History of the New Thought Movement'', which was published in 1919, and named his father an essential figure in founding the movement. [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] is also considered a founder.

Hopkins, called the "Teacher of Teachers", was a former student of Mary Baker Eddy. Because of her role in teaching several influential leaders who emerge later in New Thought movement history, she is also given credit as a mother of the movement. Inspired by medieval mystic [[Joachim of Fiore]], Hopkins viewed the Christian Trinity: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Mother-Spirit]]. She wrote ''High Mysticism'' and ''Scientific Christian Mental Practice'' and founded the [[Emma Hopkins College of Metaphysical Science]], which graduated a large number of women.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, G.M. (2002) ''Emma Curtis Hopkins: Forgotten founder of New Thought.'' Syracuse University Press. p 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

Numerous churches and groups developed within the New Thought movement. [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] is called the "Teacher of Teachers" because of the number of people she taught who went on to found groups within the New Thought movement. After learning from Hopkins, [[Annie Rix Militz]] went on to found the [[Home of Truth]]. Another student, [[Malinda E. Cramer]] became a co-founder of [[Divine Science]], along with Mrs. Bingham, who later taught [[Nona L. Brooks]], who co-founded Divine Science with Cramer. [[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles]] and [[Myrtle Fillmore]], who went to Hopkins together, went on to found the [[Unity School of Christianity]] afterwards. Authors learned from Hopkins, too, including Dr. [[H. Emilie Cady]], writer of the Unity textbook ''Lessons in Truth''; [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]], New Thought poet; and [[Elizabeth Towne]]. Considerably later, [[Ernest Holmes]], who established [[Religious Science]] and founded the [[United Centers for Spiritual Living]].&lt;ref&gt;Braden, C.S. (1963) [http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html "A Brief History of The New Thought Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310220040/http://www.tricitychurchrsi.org/html/new_thought.html |date=2012-03-10 }}, ''Spirits In Rebellion.'' Retrieved June 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unity Church is the largest New Thought church today, with thousands of members around the world. It was formed by the Fillmores in 1891. [[Divine Science]] was also founded in the late 19th century by Melinda Cramer and Nona Brooks. The United Centers for Spiritual Living was founded by Ernest Holmes in 1927. A similar organization, the [[Jewish Science|Society for Jewish Science]],originally conceived by Rabbi Alfred G. Moses in the early 1900s, the movement was institutionalized in 1922 with Rabbi [[Morris Lichtenstein]]'s. The New Thought movement extends around the world. The largest denomination outside the U.S., [[Seicho-no-Ie]], was founded in 1930 by [[Masaharu Taniguchi]] in Japan. Today, it has missions around the world, including the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;(1970) ''Rice University Studies, Volume 56'', Issues 1-2. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller churches, including the [[Home of Truth]] founded in 1899 in [[Alameda, California]] continue successfully,&lt;ref&gt;Keller, R.S., Ruether, R.R., and Cantlon, M. (2006) ''Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America, Volume 2.'' Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Agape International Spiritual Center]], a megachurch led by Rev. Dr. [[Michael Beckwith]] in the Los Angeles-area.

A variety of umbrella New Thought organizations have existed, including the [[International New Thought Alliance]], which existed in some form as early as 1899. The [[Affiliated New Thought Network]] was formed in 1992 to provide an overarching New Thought organization. Since 1974 the [[Universal Foundation for Better Living]] has been a gathering of Christian New Thought congregations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;DuPree, S.S. (1996) ''African-American Holiness Pentecostal Movement: An annotated bibliography. Taylor &amp; Francis. p 380.&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, New Thought leaders created an umbrella organization called the [[League for the Larger Life]]. It lasted from 1916 through the 1950s.

There have been many New Thought schools. The most famous may be the [[Unity Village, Missouri|Unity School of Christianity]] in Missouri, founded in the early 20th century. The [[Affiliated New Thought Network#Emerson Theological Institute|Emerson Theological Institute]] has operated since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, G. (2006) ''New Thought, Ancient Wisdom: The History and Future of the New Thought Movement.'' Templeton Foundation Press. p 141.&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century Horatio Dresser ran an organization called the [[School of Applied Metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Tumber, C. (2002) ''American feminism and the birth of new age spirituality: searching for the higher self, 1875-1915.'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychiana]] was a mail-order denomination operated by [[Frank B. Robinson]] that taught and spread the word about [[New Thought]] through the U.S. Postal Service.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

It claims that in the different [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Iberian kingdoms]],   the [[Moors|Muslims]], [[Catholic Church|Christians]] and [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews]] lived in relative peace. According to this interpretation of history, this period of religious diversity differs from later Spanish and Portuguese history when Catholicism became the sole religion in the Iberian Peninsula, as a result of expulsions and forced conversions.

However, the historicity of the above view of the supposed intercultural harmony has also been challenged as a "myth", with the argument that it is too strongly dependent on unreliable documentation.&lt;ref name="DassMyth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dass|first1=Nirmal|title=Review of The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise: Muslims, Christians, and Jews Under Islamic Rule in Medieval Spain|url=http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/history/andalusia-or-the-legend-of-islamic-spain|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Intercollegiate Studies Institute|date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Qurtuba"&gt;[http://www.awraq.es/blob.aspx?idx=5&amp;nId=96&amp;hash=ac20943d589408c5a0a3cd2c1e0908a4], Qurtuba:  Algunas reflexiones críticas sobre el califato de Córdoba y el mito de la convivencia [Qurtuba:  Some Critical Reflections on the Caliphate of Cordova and the Convivencia Myth], by Eduardo Manzano Moreno, Awraq n.° 7. 2013, pp 226-246&lt;/ref&gt; “Contemporary ecumenist appeal to the ‘Golden Age’ of tolerance" in the 10th and 11th centuries in [[Córdoba, Andalusia]], Spain under Muslim rule, but, for the most part, they are not interested in what actually happened among the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Rather, they describe it as ‘tolerance,’ a word “that would have had little or no meaning at that time.”&lt;ref&gt;Aaron W. Hughes, ''Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural meaning==
''La Convivencia'' often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three religious groups and ideas of [[religious tolerance]]. [[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] invokes this concept and indicates that it played an important role in bringing the classics of Greek philosophy to Europe, with translations from Greek to Arabic to Hebrew and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James (2001), ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews'', Chapter 33. Houghton Mifflin, Co., Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerrilynn Dodds references this concept in the spatial orientation seen in architecture that draws on building styles seen in synagogues and mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/213407379|title=The arts of intimacy : Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the making of Castilian culture|last=Denise.|first=Dodds, Jerrilynn|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Menocal, Maria Rosa., Balbale, Abigail Krasner.|isbn=9780300142143|location=New Haven|oclc=213407379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of ''La Convivencia'' was [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was “one of the most important cities in the history of the world.” In it, “Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.”&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, “Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 257 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; [[María Rosa Menocal]],  Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, further describes the libraries of Córdoba as "a significant benchmark of overall social (not just scholarly) well being, since they represented a near-perfect crossroads of the material and the intellectual." &lt;ref&gt;Menocal, María Rosa (2002), "The Ornament of the World: how Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain", Little, Brown, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

James L. Heft, the Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at [[University of Southern California|USC]], describes ''La Convivencia'' as one of the “rare periods in history” when the three religions did not either keep “their distance from one another, or were in conflict.” During most of their co-existing history, they have been “ignorant about each other” or “attacked each other.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/ James L. Heft, “The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue”] The First Sheridan-Campbell Lecture Given at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, Malta, May 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Convivencia==
{{main|Expulsion of the Moriscos}}
{{main|Expulsion of the Jews from Spain}}
While the [[Reconquista]] was ongoing, Muslims and Jews who came under Christian control were allowed to practice their religion to some degree. This ended in the late 15th century with the [[fall of Granada]] in 1492. Even before this event, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] had been established in 1478. In 1492, with the [[Alhambra decree]], those Jews who had not converted to Catholicism were expelled. Many Jews settled in [[Portugal]], where they were expelled in 1497.

Similarly the Muslims of Iberia were forced to convert or face either death or expulsion. This happened even though the Granadan Muslims had been assured of religious freedom at the time of their surrender. Between 1500 and 1502 all remaining Muslims of Granada and Castile were converted.&lt;ref name="Making Europe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kidner|first1=Frank|last2=Bucur|first2=Maria|last3=Mathisen|first3=Ralph|last4=McKee|first4=Sally|last5=Weeks|first5=Theodore|title=Making Europe: The Story of the West|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285415185|pages=376|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525, Muslims in Aragon were similarly forced to convert. The Muslim communities who converted became known as [[Moriscos]]. Still they were suspected by the ''old Christians'' of being crypto-Muslims and so between 1609 and 1614 their entire population of 300,000 was forcibly expelled. All these expulsions and conversions resulted in Catholic Christianity becoming the sole sanctioned religion in the Iberian Peninsula.

==Criticisms==
[[David Nirenberg]] challenges the significance of the age of "convivencia", claiming that far from a "peaceful ''convivencia''" his own work "demonstrates that violence was a central and systemic aspect of the coexistence of majority and minority in medieval Spain, and even suggests that coexistence was in part predicated on such violence".&lt;ref&gt;Nirenberg, David, Communities of violence • Persecution of Minorities in the Middle ages. Princeton University Press, 1996. P. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], professor of Near Eastern studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the "idealized" interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with what Cohen calls the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78 |doi=10.2307/1455066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen aims to present a correction to both these "myths".

The Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record [“el concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura histórica“]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia [[meme]] [“... quizá pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del tópico convivencial.”] Dr. Manzano attributes the genesis of the convivencia myth to the Spanish philologist Américo Castro (1885-1972).  But Castro’s conception “… was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation …”&lt;ref name="Qurtuba"/&gt;

During the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was, more often than not, marked by segregation and mutual hostility.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31 (25)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of the entire Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogroms in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], which may have prompted his bitter statement that Islam had inflicted more pain on the Jewish people than any other 'nation'.&lt;ref&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''military chaplain''' ministers to [[military personnel]] and, in most cases, their families and [[civilians]] working for the [[military]]. In some cases they will also work with local civilians within a military area of operations.

Although the term ''[[chaplain]]'' originally had [[Christian]] roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh H. |last=Morgan |url=http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |title=The Etymology of the Word Chaplain |work=International Pentecostal Holiness Church |accessdate=9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905050247/http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |archivedate=5 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally used today in military organizations to describe all professionals specially trained to serve any spiritual need, regardless of religious affiliation. In addition to offering [[pastoral care]] to individuals, and supporting their religious rights and needs, military chaplains may also advise the executive on issues of religion, and [[ethics]], [[morale]] and [[morals]] as affected by religion.  They may also [[wikt:liaison|liaise]] with local religious leaders in an effort to understand the role of religion as a factor both in hostility and war and in reconciliation and peace.&lt;ref name=TakingFaith&gt;{{cite web | first=Jane | last=Lampman | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1999/0304/p15s1.html | title=Taking faith to the 'new' front lines | quote=In all the hot spots – yet rarely mentioned – military chaplains are some of today's unsung heroes. | work=The [[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=4 March 1999 |accessdate=9 September 2010}} On the role of chaplains in multinational operations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military chaplains normally represent a religion or faith group but work with military personnel of all faiths and none. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref name="www2.canada.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |title=Spiritual guidance without all that religion |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113118/http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also employ ''[[Secular humanism|humanist]]'' chaplains who offer a non-religious approach to chaplain support.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains, but their authority comes from their sending church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/whoweare/endorsingauthorities.cfm |title=RAF Chaplains - Endorsing Authorities |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course, including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain. Naval chaplains called to service with the Royal Marines undertake a commando course at [[Commando Training Centre Royal Marines]], Lympstone and if successful serve with a front-line Royal Marines unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Explore-Opportunities/Job-Finder/Roles/~/media/Files/CNR-PDFs/Chaplain.pdf |title=Chaplaincy |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Army chaplains undertake seven-weeks training at The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.mod.uk/rolefinder/role/25/chaplain/&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Air Force chaplains must complete 12 weeks Specialist Entrant course at the [[RAF College Cranwell]] followed by a Chaplains' Induction Course at Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] of a further 2 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/visitorjoin/joinfulltime.cfm |title=RAF Chaplains - Becoming a full time Commissioned RAF Chaplain |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term, ''nomination'', is not generally applied to the process of becoming a military chaplain. Individuals volunteer, and if they are accepted, they are ''commissioned'' as military staff officers in the Chaplain Corps. Members of the clergy who meet the qualifications for service as an officer in the military are free to apply for service with any of the three United States Chaplain Corps: the Army, Navy, and Air Force each has a Chaplain Corps, with Navy chaplains also assigned to serve with Marine Corps units, Coast Guard units, and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]]. Some clergy, like rabbis, can apply without permission from any individual or organization within their faith group; others, in faith groups that have a hierarchy established to make decisions on the postings or positions of their members, must be granted permission from the appropriate official, such as the appropriate Bishop. As the application process proceeds, and the military determines whether the applicant will meet standards in areas such as health, physical fitness, age, education, citizenship, past criminal history, and ''suitability'' for service, which includes supporting the ''free exercise of religion'' for men and women of all faiths, an ''endorsement'' from an ''endorsing agency'' that is recognized by the Department of Defense, representing one or more faith groups in the United States, will be required, in part to ensure that the separation of church and state is honored. Neither the government as a whole nor the military in particular will be put into the position of determining whether an individual is a ''bona fide'' priest, minister, rabbi, imam, etc. (The requirement for such an endorsement has been in force since 1901, and today many of the various religious endorsing agencies work together under such non-governmental voluntary umbrella groups as the [[National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces]].) Although ordination is usually required for chaplain service, some "equivalent" status is accepted for individuals from religious groups which do not have ordination, such as the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]]. Additionally, in cases where an endorsing agency is not yet established for an individual's religion, it is possible for him or her to be endorsed by the endorsing agency of another group, a process which was followed for the first Muslim chaplains in the military. In any event, this endorsement is recognized as ''necessary, but not sufficient'' for acceptance as a chaplain: in other words, the military will not accept an individual for service as a chaplain, nor allow him or her to continue to serve, without such an endorsement remaining in force; however, the decision as to whether to accept that individual remains with the military service, and the individual can be rejected for a number of reasons, including the needs of the military, even with the endorsement of an endorsing agency.

==Non-combatant status==
The [[Geneva Conventions]] are silent on whether chaplains may bear arms. However, the Conventions do state ([[Protocol I]], 8 June 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]: they do not have the right to participate directly in hostilities.

It is generally assumed that during [[World War II]], chaplains were unarmed. Crosby describes an incident where a US chaplain became a trained tank gunner and was removed from the military for this "entirely illegal, not to mention imprudent" action.&lt;ref name="Crosby"&gt;{{cite book | last=Crosby | first=Donald F. | year=1994 | title=Battlefield Chaplains: Catholic Priests in World War II | place=Lawrence, KS | publisher=University Press of Kansas | isbn=0-7006-0814-1 | pages=xxi, xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some British chaplains serving in the Far East, however, were armed: [[George MacDonald Fraser]] recalls&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fraser | first=G.M. | year=1995 | edition=trade paperback | title=Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma | place=London | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-272687-4 | pages=109, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the tall figure of the battalion chaplain, swinging along good style with his .38 on his hip" immediately behind the lead platoon during a battalion attack. Fraser asks, "if the padre shot [an enemy], what would the harvest be ... apart from three ringing cheers from the whole battalion?"&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;
The Reverend [[Leslie Hardman]], the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army's]] senior Jewish chaplain, who became well known for his work amongst the liberated prisoners after the capture of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], was another who insisted on being armed while on active service.&lt;ref name="GuardianObituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/secondworldwar-judaism | title=Obituary: The Rev Leslie Hardman | work=The Guardian | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=15 April 2014 | author=Alderman, Geoffrey | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not [[medical personnel]], to be unarmed in combat, although the US does not prohibit chaplains from earning marksmanship awards or participating in marksmanship competitions. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and also Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDmclwxTEU&amp;list=UUuuTCooIMbBFHNbPcSS7 "Afghanistan: Chaplains provide comfort to troops"], ''[[SBS World News]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; make it an issue of individual conscience. There are anecdotal accounts that even US and UK chaplains have at least occasionally unofficially borne weapons: Chaplain (then Captain) James D. Johnson, of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam describes (''Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle'') carrying the M-16 rifle while embedded with a combat patrol. Since 1909 US chaplains on operations have been accompanied by an armed chaplain assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624212250/http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps on this occasion it was felt that an unarmed uniformed man would draw unwelcome attention.

Captured chaplains are not considered [[prisoners of war]] and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949, Chapter IV Art 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably, serving chaplains have died in action. The [[US Army]] and [[US Marines|Marines]] lost 100 chaplains killed in action during World War II: the third highest casualty rate behind the [[infantry]] and the [[Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name="Crosby"/&gt; Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have been awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]], and nine have received the [[Medal of Honor]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|US military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others.

In 2006, training materials obtained by US intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting US troops, there read: "Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare."

==Chief of chaplains/chaplain general==
[[File:Riley Chaplain-General.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anglican Archbishop Riley addressing a crowd as 'Chaplain-General to the AIF']]
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}

Military chaplains are often supervised by a [[chaplain general]] or chief of chaplains, on the staff of the leader of the nation's military forces. In some countries, like Israel, Canada, and South Africa, one chief of chaplains/chaplain general serves in that position for all chaplains of all religions, in all branches of the military.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In many other countries, such as France, there is a separate chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each faith group represented by chaplains.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In other countries, like the United States, there is one chaplain general/[[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|chief of chaplains]] for each branch of the military. So, for example, in the United States, there is an [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army|Army]], [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Air Force|Air Force]] chief of chaplains. They meet on as representatives to the [[Armed Forces Chaplains Board]],&lt;ref name=AFCB&gt;[http://www.mfr.usmc.mil/HQ/Chaplains/Instructions/DOD%205120.08p%20Armed%20Forces%20Chaplains%20Board.pdf Armed Forces Chaplains Board]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (AFCB).

Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss issues that cross service lines, but each reports as a staff officer of his or her service, to the Chief of Staff of the Army or Air Force, or the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] of the Navy. (In the United States, Navy chaplains serve Navy, [[Chaplain of the United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and [[Chaplain of the Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] personnel. Navy chaplains also assigned to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]], for Merchant Marine personnel.)

==International organization==
The [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] grew out of a conference [[NATO]] chiefs of chaplains organized by the [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) in 1990.&lt;ref name=OpeningOfTheFirstInternational&gt;{{cite web|first=S Lt L.A |last=Benjamin |title=Opening of the First International Military Chief of Chaplains Conference |url=http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075245/http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It welcomes any chief of chaplains (or ''chaplain general'', an equivalent term used by many nations).

==Religions and faith group organization==
===Christianity===

====Roman Catholic Church====
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
[[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] chaplains are generally organized into [[military ordinariate]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA]]. Potential Roman Catholic chaplains must seek permission from their [[diocesan bishop|diocesan]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] or [[religious superior]] to serve as a military chaplain. While serving as a chaplain, the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] or [[deacon]] remains [[incardinated]] in his home [[diocese]], but is temporarily under the direction of the [[prelate]] of the ordinariate for the duration of his service.

====Protestant denominations====
Each of the various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian denominations may set its own requirements for certification as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.robis.net/uploads/JID44_Military%20Chaplaincy%20guidelines%20final.pdf Serving the Lord as a Chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States of America]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (adopted by the Home Missions Commission, June 2000).

===Judaism===
[[File:Jewish service during World War I.jpg|thumb|Austrian Jewish military service during WWI (1914-18).]]
Besides the [[Military Rabbinate]] of Israel, today, military [[rabbi]]s serve throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US military forces, and various European armies.
Since the rise of the Christian religion in Europe and worldwide, as a matter of course Christians fought against Christians over and over again. During World War I, for the first time a substantial number of Jews served on all sides of the war, and so did military rabbis. As a result of 18th and 19th centuries` emancipation, ''military field rabbis'' served on all fronts and in all combating nations.

==Badges and insignia==
[[File:Usnavy worshippennant.GIF|thumb|right|110px|Worship Pennant, flying over the National Ensign (American flag) on a US Navy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Per Navy customs, traditions and etiquette, [[Pennant (church)#United States Navy|Worship Pennants]] may be flown above the Ensign {{cite web | title=Naval Customs, Traditions, &amp; Etiquette – Church Pennant | url=http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | work=US Fleet Forces | publisher=United States Navy | date= | accessdate= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613045812/http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | archive-date=2015-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Badges and insignia vary widely across nations and services; though generally include some form of symbol specific to the individual chaplain's religion.

In addition to badges and insignias for individual chaplains, certain nations, including the United States, fly a [[Pennant (church)|Church or Worship Pennant]] during the time a chaplain leads a religious worship service, especially on ships at sea.  On United States Navy ships it is the only pennant that flies above the United States flag.

==Military chaplains by country==

===Argentina===

Roman Catholic military chaplains served in the Argentine armed forces since the early nineteenth century, and wore officers´ uniforms and ranks.
However, the use of these was discontinued in the 1970s in the Army and the Air Force, and in the 2000s in the Navy, due to allegations of some chaplains supposedly abusing their military position and thus discouraging their subordinates to approach them when in need. Nevertheless, chaplains continue to wear combat uniform (but no rank insignia) when accompanying the troops in field operations or exercises, and are still considered as a part of the officers corps.
No specific provisions exist for the spiritual support to non-Catholics.

===Australia===

====Army and Air Force====
[[File:Small box respirator.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An Australian chaplain wearing the "Large Box Respirator" also known as the "Respiratory Tower" during the First World War, Bois Grenier Sector on 5th June 1916.]]

{{See also|Royal Australian Army Chaplains' Department}}
Chaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have almost the same status as chaplains in the British armed services. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of officers of their particular branch of the services as well as the rank to which they are qualified. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] begin their commission as a Captain (Army) or Flight Lieutenant (RAAF) respectively. There are five levels or "divisions" for the seniority of chaplains in the Australian Army and Air Force with each division corresponding to a worn rank. The highest "division" is Division 5 who are "principal chaplains," of which there are three per service representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]]. The principal chaplains of the Army wear the rank of brigadier and in the RAAF, air commodore. Australian Army chaplains, whatever their rank, are mostly referred to as "Padre" by officers and soldiers alike. The title is also widely used in the RAAF for their chaplains.

====Navy====
:''See: [[Royal Australian Navy#Chaplains]]''
Like chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and RAAF, [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) chaplains are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of an RAN officer, but like chaplains in the British Royal Navy (RN) they do not wear a rank. Rather they wear the same cross and anchor emblem worn by RN chaplains on their shoulder rank slides and do not have gold braided rings or executive loops on their winter sleeve coat or summer shoulder boards. Like other chaplains in the ADF, Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Whilst Australian Navy chaplains do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as [[Commander]] (Lieutenant Colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are "principal chaplains," and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]], are accorded the rank and status of [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]. The title "Padre" for chaplains is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of "chaplain" or form of address towards an officer such as "sir." Like British Royal Navy chaplains, Royal Australian Navy chaplains wear a slightly different peaked cap to other Navy officers which apparently was designed by [[Winston Churchill]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Heads of denominations====
In the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the heads of military chaplaincy for those Christian denominations and of the Jewish faith that have an official association with the ADF, are also members of the ADF's "Religious Advisory Committee" (RAC). With respect to the [[Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches, their Bishops are members of RAC and they and the other members of RAC have the status of a two star General (US) or Major General (Australian Army), or Rear Admiral (RAN) or Air Vice-Marshal (RAAF).

The Anglican and Roman Catholic strands of Australian Defence Force Chaplaincy have websites that explain their church's mission within the Australian Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceanglicans.org.au|title=Defence Anglicans - Home|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.catholic.org.au|title=Catholic Diocese of the Australian Defence Force|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Protestant strand does not have a website, one of their chaplains has a representative blog site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.padresponderings.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium has chaplains for its army, and is mainly a Catholic chaplaincy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army-chaplaincy.be/befr/&lt;/ref&gt;

When offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/pub/oth-aut/rd-js/rd-js-eng.asp#par-14 |title=DHH - About DHH |publisher=Cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]] ruled that this order was "not lawful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Court Martial Appeals Court of Canada |url=http://decisions.cmac-cacm.ca/site/cmac-cacm/cmac-cacm/en/item/7837/index.do?r=AAAAAQAGcHJheWVyAAAAAAAAAQ |title=CMAC - Decisions |publisher=Decisions.cmac-cacm.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that that may not believe.

===Denmark===

===France===
[[File:Aumôniers militaires de la Place de Strasbourg, juin 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright|French military chaplains Jewish, Muslim and Catholic, Place de Strasbourg 2013]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the cloak of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] of Tours, (''cappa Sancti Martini''), one of the most sacred [[relic]]s of the Frankish kings, would be carried everywhere the king went, even into battle, as a holy relic upon which [[oath]]s were sworn. The clergyman who served as custodian for the cloak in its [[reliquary]] was called a ''capellānus'', and, by extension, all clergymen who officiated in reliquaries, sanctuaries, or chapels were eventually called ''cappellāni''. This eventually gave ''chapelain'' in Old French and was borrowed into English.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Henri Joseph Brahain Ducange|Ducange]], ''Glossarium'', s.v "Capella)", noted in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Chapel".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] was the king who gave legal status to the military chaplains, since chaplains serving under their lord in the Crusades were the first to be militarized. In 1531, during the [[Battle of Kappel]], the Swiss reformist [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the very first Protestant military chaplain to be killed on the battlefield.

The modern French ''Aumônerie militaire'' (military chaplaincy) was created and instituted by a July 8, 1880 Act of Parliament, which sets forth how the chaplaincy functions with regard to the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The Secularism Act (1905), which establishes a strict [[separation of church and state]] in the French government, does not however apply to the military. The defense minister appoints three command-level military chaplains—one per faith—in charge of all chaplains. The chaplains, serving in the army, are assigned by one of these three military chaplains. The first Muslim chaplain-general, Abdelkader Arbi, was commissioned in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2289423&amp;rubId=4078 |title=Ils sont les tout premiers aumôniers généraux musulmans |language=fr |publisher=La-Croix.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French military chaplains wear a uniform since [[World War II]], but have no rank or rank insignia. The modern military chaplaincy is rooted in that war, where military chaplains were incorporated in almost every [[Free French Forces]] fighting unit and made up of personnel from England, France, or any of its imperial domains. After the war, military chaplains were sent to occupation zones in Germany and Austria.

In the 1950s, military chaplains where sent in the [[French Union]]'s territories, including [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. In 1954, pastor Tissot was one of the last paratrooper volunteers to jump over the besieged [[Dien Bien Phu]] fortified camp in northern [[Vietnam]]. On May 7, he was made prisoner of the [[Viet Minh]] and sent to a re-education camp, deep in the jungle.

Since 1984, French military chaplains are involved in every military operation—including the [[Gulf War]]—from [[Rapid Reaction Force]] (''Force d'Action Rapide'') units to navy ships.

In [[France]], the existence of military chaplains has come under debate because of the separation of Church and State; however, their position has been maintained {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925085650/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wears the [[magen david|Star of David]] as insignium.]]

Initially only Christian chaplains worked in German armies. Only after the [[French Revolution]] did Jews become citizens with equal rights in Germany for the first time. An integration of Jewish soldiers within the army gave the German Reich the opportunity to recognize the Jewish urge to fight for the German “Fatherland”. The times of common Christian suppression and supremachy status changed and more and more German Jews served in the liberal French Armies of the German territories under French influence, e.g. in the Bavarian army.

In Prussia, king [[Frederick the Great]] also showed religious tolerance, but in case of the Jews he exerted intolerance. The Jews were divided into six classes, and only the privileged first class had ''de facto'' equal rights as citizens. Very few Jewish soldiers in the Prussian army of the 18th century left historical traces, e.g. Konstantin Nathanel of Salomon, who was promoted to general in 1760. Although the Jewish presence in Germany is older than Christianity,&lt;ref name=bergerM&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Michael|title=Eisernes Kreuz und Davidstern : die Geschichte jüdischer Soldaten in deutschen Armeen|year=2006|publisher=Trafo|location=Berlin|isbn=3-89626-476-1|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first "field rabbinat" was introduced during World War I. The German Kaiserreich appointed c. 30 military rabbis. Field rabbi Dr. [[Leo Baeck]] wrote the “Israelite Field Prayer Book”.

====World War II====

Germany had a tradition of appointing Catholic and Evangelical military chaplains and Jewish military field rabbis. This was continued in the Army and Navy of the [[Wehrmacht]], for the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations only. A total of 95% of all Germans being Christian, German soldiers during Nazi times continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on the belt buckles of every Army and Navy enlisted men and non-commissioned officers.&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/&gt; Despite this proportion of Christians, the totalitarian national socialistic government of the German Reich tried to weaken the authority and influence of the churches over their German adherents. Besides the international ''[[Jewish question]]'', the international character of the Catholic church was another challenge. A few Catholics who devoutly resisted the Nazis, suffered imprisonment and hardship. The case was solved by the [[Reichskonkordat]] (1933) between the [[Holy See]] and Nazi Germany. The government of the German Reich early established an pastoral ministry for the German Army and the Reichskonkordat settled the appointment of an Army bishop. Therefore, the military chaplains could more freely operate out of the Catholic hierarchy. [[Franz Justus Rarkowski]], [[Society of Mary (Marists)|S.M.]], became ordained the Catholic military Field Bishop (''Feldbischof'') of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 until 1945.

German military chaplains who served the Wehrmacht were part of the German mainstream and lent the Nazi war effort legitimacy. The Christian military chaplains served between strange poles. While the Nazi ideology was at its core pagan (the elite [[SS]] units never allowed chaplains), 95% of Germans were baptized Christians. German soldiers during the Nazi era continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on their belt buckles. “Being a chaplain in the German army had always been a prestigious position and the Nazis wanted people who represented that old military tradition (..) and not sow discord or division. They wanted people who were not troublemakers.2&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; The German military chaplains mostly wanted to bring the word of the Christian God to men in the field and to deliver the sacraments, make their families proud and serve their country. “The motives of the chaplains were not unusual, (..) their noble, personal and professional motives turned them into a legitimating force in a war of annihilation.”&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; Military chaplains in Nazi Germany were rigorously screened. First, names were put on the desks of the local civilian bishops, and then the names had to be approved by the according ministry for church affairs. Eventually the names were cleared by the military’s chaplaincy office and the [[Gestapo]] ("Secret State Police").&lt;ref name=bergen2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Prof. Dr. Doris|title=German military chaplains caught between word of God and horror of man|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|work=Holy Post|publisher=2013 National Post|accessdate=26 August 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111107113447/http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|archive-date=2011-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bergen2&gt;{{cite web|last=BERGEN|first=Prof. Doris L.|title=German Military Chaplains in World War II and the Dilemmas of Legitimacy|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/German+Military+Chaplains+in+World+War+II+and+the+Dilemmas+of...-a076751697|publisher=2001 American Society of Church History|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Organization and clothing=====
Throughout the [[Third Reich]] period, only the Army and Navy had military chaplains. When needed, other branches of the armed forces acquired chaplains from the Army or Navy or from nearby parish. In the Heer (Army), military chaplains were organized into Group 3b (Pastoral Group) of the General Army Office under the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]]. In mid 1935, four groups of military chaplains were introduced. In 1936, similar groups were introduced for the [[Kriegsmarine]] although the evolution over time was different. The groups are as follow.&lt;ref name=hayden&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Mark|title=German military chaplains in World War II|year=2005|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=9780764321566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oberpfarrer''' (Higher Priest)
* '''Pfarrer''' (Priest)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Hauptamt''' (Garrison Priest in Main Office)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Nebenamt''' (Garrison Priest for Outside Appointment)

German military chaplains did not get into the ordinary military rank system, but received privileges like any other regular officers. Army chaplains had four different types of clothing:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniformen der Deutschen Wehrmacht: einschließlich Ausrüstung und Seitenwaffen|year=1939|publisher=Verlag Otto Dietrich|location=Berlin|isbn=3931533379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Feldbluse''' (''Field Dress''). Field dress was identical for enlisted men, non-commissioned officers, and officers, and was worn on the battlefield. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used.
* '''Dienstrock''' (''Service Dress''). Service dress was the typical dress for officers, with high quality materials and tailor made. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Service dress was normally used behind the lines although photographic evidences also show this kind of uniform was worn on the battlefield. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used, sometimes with cross strap.
* '''Überrock''' (''Frock Coat''). Frock coat was used for formal occasions and when ordered, and worn over the service dress. The piping was violet.
* '''Mantel''' (''Overcoat''). Overcoat worn by military chaplains was identical to those worn by officers. However, no shoulder boards were attached. This was worn over the field dress or service dress.

No weapon was permitted to be carried by chaplains, but one photographic evidence shows a chaplain with a pistol holster on his left waist.

For the headdresses of the Army chaplains, the most common were:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* '''Schirmmütze''' (''Visor Cap''). Officer-quality visor cap with violet as the branch color (''[[Waffenfarbe]]'') for military chaplains. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, either made of metal or embroidered.
* '''Feldmütze''' (''Field Cap''). Officer-quality field cap with silver pipings and violet soutache as the ''Waffenfarbe''. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, usually embroidered.

All the buttons, national eagles, cockades, Gothic crosses, and cap chinstraps were silver for military chaplains and gold for Field Bishops.
The collar patches had violet underlay and violet piping for Catholic chaplains, and field grey underlay and violet piping for Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains.

For the Kriegsmarine, the uniform was identical to naval jacket of regular officers, but without sleeve laces and with chaplain collar patches. The collar patches were different to those of the Army. Two-prong officer's belt or brocade belt could be worn.

Although the official regulation states that military chaplains had to wear golden [[pectoral cross]], there were two standard-issue crosses that were worn:&lt;ref name=hayden/&gt;
* For Catholic chaplains, [[Crucifix|Corpus Christi]] was present on the cross. The cross itself was made either of metal or silver, with black wood insert. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.
* For Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains, the cross was plain and made of metal or silver. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.

Photographic evidences show numerous variety of pectoral crosses worn by German military chaplains during World War II.

Oftentimes, German military chaplains were issued an armband with a red cross sign and violet stripe to show their neutrality on the battlefield. This was called ''Armbinde mit Neutralitätsabzeichen '' (Armband with Neutrality Sign).

Among other things, military chaplains also wore standard liturgical [[Vestment|vestments]] such as chasuble, cope, and stole.

German religious constitutional law and its state-church law is involved in the democratic national identity of modern Germany, especially in various articles of the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. Initially, a "military-chaplaincy" contract was only signed between the state and the Protestant Church, but was extended to all other religious communities for reasons of parity.&lt;ref name=pschnabel&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnabel|first=Patrick Roger|title=About the Relationship of State and Religion|url=http://fit-for-gender.org/downloads/P-Schnabel-Staat-Religion_eng.pdf|publisher=2007 fit-for-gender.org|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the 1930s '''Reichskonkordat''' between the Holy See and Germany is still in force. In Germany, military chaplains of the [[Bundeswehr]] have no rank but have a special civilian status as part of the armed forces.

The Military Rabbinate is a unit in the Israel Defense Forces that provides religious services for military personnel, Jewish and non-Jewish, and makes decisions on issues of religion and military affairs. The Military Rabbinate is headed by the Chief Military Rabbi, who carries the rank of a Brigadier General.

The Military Rabbinate constitutes the body responsible for religious institutions in the military. In every unit or military base there are Military Rabbinate military personnel assigned responsibility for conducting or coordinating religious services, overseeing the [[Kashrut|kosher operation]] of the kitchen, and the maintenance of the synagogue and religious supplies. Actively serving military personnel can request Military Rabbinate representatives to perform marriage ceremonies and [[Brit Milah|''brit mila'']], circumcision ceremonies, for babies. The unit also oversees the legal and religious certification of marriages and divorces of individuals during their military service.

The Military Rabbinate is responsible for treating the bodies of soldiers in accordance with religious law, including the identifications and post-mortem treatment of bodies, and conducting military funerals. The Military Rabbinate also coordinates the burial of enemy soldiers and the exhuming of bodies in conjunction with prisoner exchanges.

The Military Rabbinate was founded in 1948 by Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who headed it until 1968.

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands has chaplains of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and humanist faiths, provided by the De Diensten Geestelijke Verzorging (DGV) or the Spiritual Care Services. Chaplains are trained in Vormingscentrum Landgoed Beukbergen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/personeelszorg/geestelijke-verzorging&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===

===South Africa===
[[File:Fumanekile Gqiba.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Fumanekile Gqiba]], former Chaplain General of the S. African National Defense Force, and former South African Ambassador to Israel, 1998]]
Prior to 1968, chaplains wore badges of rank as [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniforminsignia.net/index.php?p=show&amp;id=42&amp;sid=1312 Rank Insignia – Army Land Forces: South Africa: Military Chaplains since 2002]. International Encyclopedia of Uniform Insignia Association. Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1968, however, all chaplains have been senior officers and accorded the protocol status of [[colonel]] / [[captain (navy)]]. They carry the military rank of [[chaplain]] and the rank insignia, which is unique to the Chaplains Service, comprises a [[Chi Rho]] monogramme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/Christianity/christian_symbols.html |title=Christian Symbols |publisher=Atschool.eduweb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723094739/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/christianity/christian_symbols.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by a triangle. The monogramme represents the first two letters of Christ in [[Greek language|Greek]]. It originates from the days of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first [[Roman Emperor|Emperor of Rome]] to grant religious freedom to [[Christian]]s. His own conversion to the Christian faith was initiated by a dream in which the Chi-Rho monogramme appeared to him. The triangle surrounding the monogramme is the symbolic representation of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].

During the vision of the monogramme, Constantine [[Constantine I#War against Maxentius|heard the Latin words ''in hoc signo vinces'']]. The English translation of these [[Latin]] words is: "In this sign, you will conquer". This is the motto of the Chaplains Service and forms part of the [[Corps]] Badge.

In 1998, after working as chaplain general in exile for the ANC, the [[African National Congress]], during the fight against apartheid, [[Fumanekile Gqiba]] was appointed as the first black chaplain general for SANDF, the [[South African National Defense Force]]. In 2004, Major General Gqiba left the military to accept his appointment as South African Ambassador to Israel.

In the SANDF Chaplain Service, the [[Hindu]] faith is represented by a Regular Force chaplain. The rank is Cpln (Vipra) and the mode of address Vipra. The rank insignia is a deepa (lamp) with flame. This is the symbolic representation of enlightenment, the life objective of all Hindus.

The [[Muslim]]s do not have Regular Force chaplains in the SANDF because they are small in number. They are however served by part-time workers through the Chaplains Service of the SANDF and are addressed according to their religious customs as [[imam]]s.

Christian chaplains are generally referred to and addressed as Padre. They may however, be addressed according to the practice of their religious bodies e.g., Father, [[Pastor]], Umfundisi ([[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]), Moruti ([[Sotho people|Sotho]]), Dominee ([[Afrikaans]]) etc. The official written form of address is ''Cpln'' (for chaplain) followed by the appropriate ecclesiastical title of the respective chaplain e.g., Cpln (Rev), Cpln (Fr), Cpln (Pastor), Cpln, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |title=SANDF |publisher=Chaplain.mil.za |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202091248/http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with chaplains from many other nations in the southern region of the continent of Africa, South African chaplains participate in SARMCA, the ''South Africa Regional Military Chaplains Association'', which is a component organization of SADC, the ''[[Southern African Development Community]]''.

The first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century AD. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]], although their duties included jobs that today would come under the jurisdiction of [[military engineer]]s and [[medical]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. A priest attached to a feudal noble household would follow his [[Feudalism|liege]] lord into battle. In 1796 the Parliament of [[Great Britain]] passed a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] that established the [[Army Chaplains' Department]] in the [[British Army]]. The Department was awarded its "Royal" prefix in 1919 in recognition of their chaplains' service during World War I.

The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]]. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. In the Royal Navy chaplains are traditionally addressed by their Christian name, or with one of many nicknames (Bish; Sin-Bosun; Devil Dodger; Sky-Pilot etc.). In the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]], chaplains are traditionally referred to (and addressed) as ''padre'' or as Sir/Ma'am (although not the latter in the RAF).

In the [[Royal Navy]] chaplains have no rank other than "chaplain" while in the [[British Army]] they hold commissioned relative rank but are universally referred to as Padre.  On the foundation of the [[Royal Air Force]] Chaplains' Branch an attempt was made to amalgamate these differing systems creating "Relative Rank", where rank is worn but without executive authority. In practice chaplains of all three services work in similar ways using what influence and authority they have on behalf of those who consult them or seek their advice.

During World War II the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an ([[Anglican]]) [[chaplain-general]], (a [[major-general]]), who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces&lt;/ref&gt; An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full [[colonel]]) and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class ([[lieutenant colonel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black&lt;/ref&gt;

All chaplains are [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] and wear uniform. [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains bear ranks and wear rank insignia, but [[Royal Navy]] chaplains do not, wearing a cross and a special version of the officers' [[cap badge]] as their only insignia.

Chaplains in the armed forces were previously all [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Judaism|Jewish]]. The first Jewish chaplain was appointed in 1892 and some 20 to 30 were commissioned during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Phil Groom |url=http://www.ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |title=Military Chaplaincy, Christian and Jewish perspectives, November 2005 |publisher=Ccj-hillingdon.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625042626/http://ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |archivedate=2014-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent times, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) has employed only Christian chaplains, with the Jewish community providing an honorary chaplain under long-standing arrangements, although Jewish chaplains have served in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. In October 2005 the Ministry of Defence appointed four chaplains to the military; one each from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4355896.stm | work=BBC News | title=Non-Christian chaplains appointed | date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds information and archive material relating to the history of the [[RAChD|Army Chaplains' Department.]]

In the era before [[call sign]]s the radio "appointment title" for the Padre was "Sky pilot".

In the [[United States]], military chaplains have an officer's rank based on their years of service and promotion selection from among their peers. Chaplains serving in the US Armed Forces wear the uniform of their respective branch of service, and normally wear clerical attire only during the performance of a religious service. The position of rank and chaplain faith group insignia [[Religious symbolism in the United States military|varies in each military department]] and may vary significantly from one type of uniform to another within a military department.

The [[Civil Air Patrol]], the volunteer Auxiliary of the USAF, also has chaplains, who must meet the same standards for appointment as active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard chaplains. They wear the same insignia as USAF chaplains and can be called upon to assist Air Force chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.gocivilairpatrol.com/cap_national_hq/chaplain_corps/ |title=Welcome to CAP Chaplain Corps |publisher= |accessdate=21 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221173758/http://members.gocivilairpatrol.com/cap_national_hq/chaplain_corps/ |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US military chaplains, both individuals and in groups, have been involved in a number of controversies. Complaints have been made against chaplains for mandatory prayers, coercion, and using government money to promote Evangelical Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/09/airforce_lakenheath_suit_093008/ LaGrone, S.

The [[United States military chaplains#Constitutionality|constitutionality of the US chaplaincy]] has been the subject of legal challenges and scholarly dispute. One appellate case, ''Katcoff v. Marsh'' (1985) upheld the system as a permissible attempt to support service members in the "free exercise" of their religious beliefs, though others have described the details of the chaplaincy system as violations of the legal principles that the federal government maintain neutrality and avoid becoming entangled in religious affairs.

[[Talk:Mormon#Latter Day Saint vs. Latter-day Saint]]--&gt;

[[File:Mormon-book.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Book of Mormon]] as printed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (2009)]]
The word '''Mormon''' most colloquially denotes an adherent, practitioner, follower, or constituent of [[Mormonism]] in [[restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist Christianity]]. ''Mormon'' also commonly refers, specifically, to a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which is often [[colloquially]], but imprecisely, referred to as the ''Mormon Church''. In addition, the term ''Mormon'' may refer to any of the relatively small sects of [[Mormon fundamentalism]], and any branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] that recognizes [[Brigham Young]] as the successor to founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The term ''Mormon'' applies to the religion of Mormonism, as well as its culture, texts, and art. 

The term derives from the [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] published in 1830 regarded by the faith as a supplemental Testament to the [[Bible]]. Adherents believe that the book was translated from an ancient record by Smith by the gift and power of God.  The text is said to be an ancient chronicle of a fallen and lost [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] nation, compiled by the prophet–warrior, [[Mormon (Book of Mormon)|Mormon]], and his son, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last of the [[Nephite]] people. The term ''Mormon'' was initially a derogatory term applied to [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]] in the 1830s, but was soon embraced by the faith. Because the term became identified with [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] in the mid-to-late-19th century, some Latter Day Saint denominations who never practiced polygamy have renounced the term.

==Origin of the term==
{{See also|Book of Mormon}}
The term ''Mormon'' is taken from the title of the Book of Mormon, a sacred text adherents believe to have been translated from [[golden plates]] which had their location revealed by [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] to Joseph Smith and published in 1830. According to the text of the Book of Mormon, the word Mormon stems from the [[Waters of Mormon|Land of Mormon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://webdevilaz.com/religion/where-do-mormons-get-their-name-from |title=Where Do Mormons Get Their Name From? |publisher=WebDevilAZ |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the prophet [[Alma (son of Alma)|Alma]] preached the gospel and baptized converts. Mormon—who was named after the land—was a 4th-century prophet–historian who compiled and abridged many records of his ancestors into the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is believed by Mormons to be a literal record of God's dealings with [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations in the [[Americas]] from approximately 2600 BC through AD 420,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], ''A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon'' p. 117, quoted in [[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[prophet]]s and followers of [[Jesus Christ]]. The book records the teachings of Jesus Christ to the people in the Americas as well as Christ's personal ministry among the people of [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]] after his [[resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/11 3 Nephi, chapters 11-26], from scriptures.lds.org, an official website of the [[LDS Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe the Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ, "holy [[Religious text|scripture]] comparable to the [[Bible]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/introduction Introduction, Book of Mormon]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', one of the earliest published usages of the term ''Mormon'' to describe believers in the Book of Mormon was in 1833 by the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] ([[Kentucky]]) ''Daily Herald'' in an article, "The Mormons and the Anti-Mormons".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "Mormon".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular usage==
The terms ''Mormon'' and ''Mormonite'' were first used in the 1830s as [[pejorative]]s to describe those who followed Joseph Smith and believed in the divine origin of the Book of Mormon. The term was soon adopted by Mormons themselves, however, and has lost its generally pejorative status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jan|first=Shipps,|date=2001|title=Signifying Sainthood, 1830-2001|url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/arrington_lecture/6/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Mormon'' is most often used to refer to members of the LDS Church.  However, the term is also adopted by other adherents of [[Mormonism]], including adherents of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].  The term ''Mormon'' is generally disfavored by other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the [[Community of Christ]], which have distinct histories from that of the LDS Church since [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844.

The term is particularly embraced by adherents of Mormon fundamentalism, who continue to believe in and practice [[plural marriage]],&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Mormon fundamentalist'' appears to have been coined in the 1940s by LDS Church [[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]] [[Mark E. Petersen]]: Ken Driggs, "'This Will Someday Be the Head and Not the Tail of the Church': A History of the Mormon Fundamentalists at Short Creek", ''Journal of Church and State'' '''43''':49 (2001) at p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; a practice that the LDS Church [[1890 Manifesto|officially abandoned]] in 1890.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church now strictly prohibits polygamy and any member practicing it is subject to [[excommunication]]. For description of the dispute over the term "Fundamentalist Mormon," see {{cite news|title=Plural lives: the diversity of fundamentalism | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645199994,00.html | author=Carrie Moore and Elaine Jarvik| publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' | date= 2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeking to distance itself from [[polygamy]] and [[Mormon fundamentalism]], the LDS Church has taken the position that the term ''Mormon'' should only apply to the LDS Church and its members, and not other adherents who have adopted the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=e17c39628b88f010VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=f5f411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD Mormons and Polygamy], LDS News Room.&lt;/ref&gt; The church cites the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', which states, "The term Mormon is not properly applied to the other Latter Day Saints churches that resulted from the split after [Joseph] Smith’s death."&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The," Associated Press, ''The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-7382-0740-3}}, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the LDS Church's position, the term ''Mormon'' is widely used by journalists and non-journalists to refer to adherents of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].

===''Mormon Church''===
The official name of the [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]–based church is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. While the term ''Mormon Church'' has long been attached to the church as a nickname, it is not a preferred title, and the church's style guide says, "Please avoid the use of 'Mormon Church', 'LDS Church' or the 'Church of the Latter-day Saints.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide LDS Church Style Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hinckley&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/11/mormon-should-mean-more-good "''Mormon'' Should Mean 'More Good,']" ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', November 1990, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,4043-1---15-168,00.html |title=Style Guide - The Name of the Church |accessdate=2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS Church leaders have encouraged members to use the church's full name to emphasize the church's focus on [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell M. Nelson]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/05/thus-shall-my-church-be-called "Thus Shall My Church Be Called"], ''Ensign'', May 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell M.

== Scholarly usage ==
[[J. Gordon Melton]], in his ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', subdivides the Mormons into ''Utah Mormons'', ''Missouri Mormons'', ''Polygamy-Practicing Mormons'', and ''Other Mormons''.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]] (1996, 5th ed.). ''Encyclopedia of American Religions''. (Detroit: Gale, {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}}) pp. 561–585.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scheme, the "Utah Mormon" group includes the non-polygamous organizations descending from those Mormons who followed [[Brigham Young]] to what is now [[Utah]]. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is by far the largest of these groups, with a membership count totaling over 15,000,000 worldwide and the only group to initially reside in Utah. The "Missouri Mormon" groups include those non-polygamous groups that chose not to travel to Utah and are currently headquartered in Missouri, which Joseph Smith designated as the future site of the [[New Jerusalem]]. These organizations include [[Community of Christ]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], and others. "Polygamy-Practicing Mormon" groups are those that currently practice polygamy, regardless of location. Most notably, this category includes the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church) and the  [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB). "Other Mormon" groups include those that are not headquartered in Utah or Missouri and do not practice polygamy, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]] and the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].

The terms ''Utah Mormon'' and ''Missouri Mormon'' can be problematic if interpreted to mean more than the location of the various groups' headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The majority of members of "Utah Mormon" groups and "Missouri Mormon" groups no longer live in either of these US states. Although a majority of Utahns are members of the LDS Church, it has a worldwide membership with the majority of its members outside the [[United States]]. Nor do most "Missouri Mormons" live in Missouri.

==Meaning of the word==
The May 15, 1843, issue of the official Mormon periodical ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' contains an article, purportedly written by Joseph Smith, deriving the etymology of the name ''Mormon'' from English "more" + Egyptian ''mon'', "good", and extolling the meaning as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It has been stated that this word [mormon] was derived from the Greek word ''mormo''.  This is not the case.  There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of God, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the  language of that book speak for itself. On the 523d page, of the fourth edition, it reads: And now behold we have written this record according to our knowledge in the characters which are called among us the ''Reformed Egyptian'' ... none other people knoweth our language; therefore [God] hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof." ... [The] Bible in its widest sense, means ''good''; for the Savior says according to the gospel of John, "I am the ''good'' shepherd;" and it will not be beyond the common use of terms, to say that good is among the most important in use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its meaning is the same, and is ever in opposition to ''bad''.  We say from the Saxon, ''good''; the Dane, ''god''; the Goth, ''goda''; the German, ''gut''; the Dutch, ''goed''; the Latin, ''bonus''; the Greek, ''kalos''; the Hebrew, ''tob''; and the Egyptian, ''mon''.  Hence, with the addition of ''more'', or the contraction, ''mor'', we have the word MOR-MON; which means, literally, ''more good''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121202101852/http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&amp;CISOPTR=8618&amp;REC=9 "Correspondence"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' ([[Nauvoo, Illinois]]), vol. 4, no. 13, p. 194] (May 15, 1843); quoted in Joseph Smith ([[Joseph Fielding Smith]] ed., 1938) ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether Smith was the actual author of this passage is uncertain. [[Church Historian and Recorder|Official LDS Church historian]] [[B.&amp;nbsp;H. Roberts]] removed the quote from his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' compilation, saying he found evidence that [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W.&amp;nbsp;W. Phelps]] wrote that paragraph and that it was "based on inaccurate premises and was offensively pedantic."&lt;ref&gt;''Defender of the Faith: The B. H. Roberts Story'', pp. 291–292&lt;/ref&gt; LDS Church [[Apostle (LDS Church)|apostle]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] noted that the "more good" translation is incorrect but added that "''Mormon'' means 'more good'" is a positive motto for members of the LDS Church.&lt;ref name = hinckley/&gt;

===Meaning in the Book of Mormon===

According to the Book of Mormon, a man named [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] compiled nearly 1000 years of writings as well as chronicled events during his lifetime. Most of the text of the Book of Mormon consists of this compilation and his own writings, which may account for its title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-beliefs/the-restoration-of-truth/the-book-of-mormon Mormon.org: the Book of Mormon]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the name ''Mormon'' is also used in the Book of Mormon as a place name (e.g. [[Waters of Mormon]]), which "Ancient America Foundation" scholar David Lamb uses to offer an alternate explanation for the title:

{{quote|[The prophet] [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] was not named after his father; he was named after the land of Mormon. He had been taught about his heritage by his parents and understood the sacred significance associated with the name Mormon. No doubt his father also bore the name Mormon for the same reason. In {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=12}} he gives us a clear indication that the name Mormon is symbolically synonymous with the restoration of the covenant which took place in the land of Mormon by Alma and his people.

A study of the {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Introduction}} of the Book of Mormon tells us its main purpose is to restore a  knowledge of the covenants to the house of Israel. This adds weight to the understanding that the name Mormon was always associated with the place of the restoration of the covenant to the Nephites. In fact, the name Mormon became synonymous with the concept of restoring the covenants.

In light of this understanding, the Book of Mormon is not named for a man. It is named for the place where the covenant was restored. Symbolically, the Book of Mormon bears the name "Book of the Restoration of the Covenant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/articles/040507mormon.html David Lamb, ''The Meaning of the Name of "Mormon"''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201232510/http://www.meridianmagazine.com/articles/040507mormon.html |date=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Trademark==
In some countries, ''Mormon'' and some phrases including the term are [[registered trademark]]s owned by [[Intellectual Reserve]], a holding company for the LDS Church's [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Mormon Tabernacle Choir'' is registered as United States Federal TM Reg. No. 2766231, and ''Mormon'' is registered in the [[European Community]] serial number EC004306701, registered July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the LDS Church has applied for a trademark on ''Mormon'' as applied to religious services; however, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] rejected the application, stating that the term ''Mormon'' was too generic, and is popularly understood as referring to a particular kind of church, similar to ''[[Presbyterian]]'' or ''[[Methodist]]'', rather than a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/PA_1_0_LT/OpenServletWindow?serialNumber=78161091&amp;scanDate=2005110155650&amp;DocDesc=Offc+Action+Outgoing&amp;docType=OOA&amp;currentPage=1&amp;rowNum=11&amp;rowCount=33&amp;formattedDate=01-Nov-2005 Office Action, November 1, 2005].  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was abandoned as of August 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78161091 Federal TM Ser.

'''Multiconfessionalism''' is a term applied to countries which have a power sharing arrangement between people of different faiths, usually three or more significant confessional groups within the same jurisdiction. Examples of modern countries deemed multiconfessional are [[Religion in Lebanon|Lebanon]]{{sfn|Dawahare|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sjur Bergan|author2=Hilligje van't Land|title=Speaking Across Borders: The Role of Higher Education in Furthering Intercultural Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSq7GN3ZwGQC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2010|publisher=Council of Europe|isbn=978-92-871-6941-9|pages=167–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary McIntosh|author2=Dan Abele|author3=University of Strathclyde.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28041">This article on '''nudity in religion''' deals with the differing attitudes to [[nudity]] and [[modesty]] among world [[religion]]s.

==Ancient Greek religion==
[[File:Venere di Milo 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of ''[[Aphrodite of Milos]]'', the Greek goddess of love and beauty, ({{circa|100}} BC), [[Louvre]]]]
[[Hesiod]] the writer of the poem ''[[Theogony]]'', which describes the origins and genealogies of the [[Greek gods]] in [[Ancient Greek religion]], suggested that farmers should "Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all [[Demeter]]'s fruits in due season."{{sfn|Villing|2010|p=40}} [[Demeter]] is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.

== Abrahamic religions ==

The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all recount the legend of the [[Garden of Eden]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]].  After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with fig leaves.{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:74|NIV}} Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with [[original sin]], an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth. {{efn|when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies.{{Cite quran|7|22}} }} This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it.{{efn|O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best.{{Cite quran|7|26}} }} Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.

=== Judaism ===
{{see also|Tzniut}}

In Judaism, nudity is an aspect of [[body modesty]] which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of [[Tzniut]] which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.

A person who enters a ritual bath (a ''[[mikveh]]'') does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.

Care needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour.{{sfn|Telushkin|1977|p=17-18}} For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of [[Noah]]'s sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son "saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside" what he had done to his father.{{efn|[Noah] drank the wine [of his vineyard] and became drunk. He uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their backs, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And when Noah awoke and learned what [Ham] had done to him, he said "Cursed be Canaan [Ham's son], the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:21-25|NIV}} }}{{efn|it has been suggested that this episode involved Ham doing more than just viewing his father's nakedness.{{sfn|Edwards|1978|p=113}} }} Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Representation of baptism in early Christian art]]
[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|upright|Baptism of [[Clovis I]] (496)]]
''{{Main article|Christian naturism}}''

The early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity.{{sfn|Knights|1999}} In the [[Old Testament]], Isaiah in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|20|NIV}} walk nude as a sign of shame against Egypt. 

The first recorded [[liturgy]] of [[baptism]], written down by Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.{{sfn |Hippolytus|2013|p=33}} {{harvtxt|Guy|2003}}, however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.

Later [[Christian]] attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.

Several saints, such as a number of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as [[Basil Fool for Christ]], practiced nudity as a form of [[ascetic]] poverty.

Early Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the [[Renaissance]], the [[Catholic Church]] was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Michelangelo]], but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the [[Sistine Chapel]] painted by Michelangelo.

 }} of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], notes that early Christian art depicts,{{sfn|Wilpert|1929}} as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are [[Jonah]] emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, [[Daniel]] emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref |Ezekiel|37:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the [[resurrection]]. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and one representation of the [[Miracle at Cana]].

In 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person."{{sfn|Wojtyla|2013|p=}}

=== Christian sects ===

Sects have arisen within [[Christianity]] from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the [[Adamites]] and the [[Freedomites]] social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.

Today, [[Christian naturist]]s maintain that [[naturism|social nudity]] is a normal part of Christianity and is acceptable. {{harvtxt|De Clercq|2011}} argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.

=== Islam ===

''{{Main article|Intimate parts in Islam}}''

In [[Islam]] the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the ''[[awrah]]'', and while referred to in the [[Qur'an]], is addressed in more detail in [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bukhari:6:60:282|url=http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/hadith/sunnan_abu_dawud/32/4091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sunni tradition, the male ''awrah'' is from the navel to knees. Other denominations have differing interpretations. For women, there are different classifications of ''awrah''. In public, many Muslim women wear the [[hijab]] and long dresses which covers most of their head and body, with only specific body parts such as hands and face exposed. But in front of direct family (parents, children, siblings), the ''awrah'' is relaxed further, allowing them to be uncovered, except between the chest and the thighs. [[Sharia]] law in some Islamic countries requires women to observe [[purdah]], covering their entire bodies, including the face (see [[niqab]] and [[burqa]]), However, the degrees of covering vary according to local custom and/or interpretation of Sharia law.

* '''For men''', the [[awrah]] is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s; inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s). However, in most Islamic cultures, a man is frowned upon should he walk around in public without covering the upper half of his body.
* '''For women''', in front of non-[[mahram]] men and non-Muslim women, the [[awrah]] is the whole body, apart from the hands and the face (and, solely according to the Hanafis, the feet). In front of Muslim women it is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s, inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s), and with [[mahram]] men there are three opinions:
# It is from the shoulders (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive). ([[Hanbali]] opinion)
# It is from the stomach (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive according to the [[Hanafis]], but not according to the [[Shafi'i]]s and [[Maliki]]s). ([[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] opinion)
# It is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (inclusive) when with either. (Alternate [[Hanafi]] opinion)

* '''For both genders''', it is encouraged to wear loose clothing. Note that the awrah is not necessarily what is preferable to wear but what is the bare minimum. It is reported that [[Muhammad]] said, "Modesty is a part of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari and Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian religions ==

[[File:Naga baba.jpg|thumb|right|Naga mystics, at the Hindu bathing ceremony of Ardha [[Kumbh Mela]], at [[Allahabad]]]]

In ancient [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian]] cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously [[minoritarian]]) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the [[gymnosophists]] (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day [[Hindu]] devotion and in [[Jainism]].

=== Hinduism ===
====Philosophical basis====
The philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ ([[Puruṣārtha]]) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) pp.9 and 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Spiritual basis=====
In the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example [[Kali]] is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity. &lt;ref&gt;Pravrajika Vedantaprana, Saptahik Bartaman, Volume 28, Issue 23, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 10 October, 2015) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Trailanga Swami]], the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Material basis=====
In comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book ''The Renaissance in India''. He says about Hinduism in the book – “Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…”&lt;ref&gt; SRINVANTU Magazine, 63, College Street, Kolkata – 700 073(ed. 8th June, 2018) pp.26 and 28 (Website: http://srinvantu.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;
Extreme hedonists and materialists like the [[Charvaka]]s are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, “Marthakamaveva purusharthau” (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;There is another sloka in support of their view – “Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha” (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
For non-hedonists pursuing [[kama]] (sensual pleasures) accompanied with [[dharma]] (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Some of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari ([[Lalleshwari]]) &lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 20: We Do Not Visit Kashmir, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;, Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri. &lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) pp. 187 and 251&lt;/ref&gt;Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to  nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the Hindu religious sects, only the [[sadhu]]s (monks) of the [[Nāga]] sect can be seen nude.{{sfn|Crooke|1919}} They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their [[Akhara]] or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during [[Kumbh Mela]]. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a ''[[talwar]]'' ([[sword]]), ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' ([[trident]]), ''bhala'' ([[javelin]]) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siddharth|first1=Gautam|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/Nagas-Once-were-warriors/articleshow/18026313.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times Syndication Service|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

In the ''[[Digambara]]'' sect of [[Jainism]], monks and nuns are "sky-clad" and the members of this sect also keep their holy statues naked. However, the ''[[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambar]]'' sect is "white-clad" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.{{sfn|Sharma| Sharma|2004|p=262}}

== New religious movements ==

[[File:Raëlian Women at the Seoul, Korea Love Hug Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|Raelians in South Korea]]

=== Neopaganism ===

In many modern [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[religious movement]]s, such as [[Wicca]], social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|''skyclad'']] refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.{{sfn|Zimmermann|Gleason|2006|p=77}}

=== Raëlism ===

In [[Raëlism]], nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of [[topfreedom]] on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual "[[Go Topless Day]]" protest (also known as "National GoTopless Day", "International Go-Topless Day", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Take Off Your Shirt Everybody! It's Go Topless Day|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/24/go-topless-day-_n_5698006.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paganism''' is a term first used in the fourth century by [[early Christianity|early Christians]] for populations of the [[Roman Empire]] who practiced [[polytheism]], either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population or because they were not ''[[Miles Christianus|milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).&lt;ref name=CF&gt;J.

New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780191620010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the [[ancient world]]. In the 20th century, it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of [[Modern Paganism]], [[List of Neopagan movements|Neopagan movements]] and [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Polytheistic reconstructionists]]. Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices, such as [[nature worship]], that are different from those in the largest world religions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/paganism Paganism], Oxford Dictionary (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670-e-659?rskey=Uq4ZiB&amp;result=9 Paganism], ''The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', Bron Taylor (2010), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199754670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary knowledge of old pagan religions comes from several sources, including [[Anthropology|anthropological]] [[field research]] records, the evidence of [[Archaeology|archaeological artifacts]], and the historical accounts of ancient writers regarding cultures known to [[Classical antiquity]].

===Pagan===
{{quote|It is crucial to stress right from the start that until the 20th century, people did not call themselves pagans to describe the religion they practised. The notion of paganism, as it is generally understood today, was created by the early Christian Church. It was a label that Christians applied to others, one of the antitheses that were central to the process of Christian self-definition. As such, throughout history it was generally used in a derogatory sense.|[[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]]|Paganism: A Very Short Introduction, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Owen (2011). Paganism: A Very Short Introduction. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780191620010}}.
p=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term pagan is derived from [[Late Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:paganus|paganus]]}}, revived during the [[Renaissance Latin|Renaissance]]. Itself deriving from [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:pagus|pagus]]}} which originally meant 'region delimited by markers', {{lang|la|paganus}} had also come to mean 'of or relating to the countryside', 'country dweller', 'villager'; by extension, '[[wikt:rustic|rustic]]', 'unlearned', '[[wikt:yokel|yokel]]', '[[wikt:bumpkin|bumpkin]]'; in [[Roman military]] [[jargon]], 'non-combatant', 'civilian', 'unskilled soldier'. It is related to {{lang|la|[[wikt:pangere|pangere]]}} ('to fasten', 'to fix or affix') and ultimately comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*pag-'' ('to fix' in the same sense).&lt;ref name="etymonline_pagan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=pagan (n.)|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=pagan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=The Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The adoption of ''paganus'' by the Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church. Elsewhere, Hellene or gentile (''[[Wikt:ethnicon|ethnikos]]'') remained the word for pagan; and paganos continued as a purely secular term, with overtones of the inferior and the commonplace.|[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]]|''Late Antiquity'', 1999&lt;ref name="Peter Brown 1999"&gt;Peter Brown, in Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar, eds., ''Late Antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', 1999, ''s.v.'' Pagan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Medieval]] writers often assumed that ''paganus'' as a religious term was a result of the conversion patterns during the [[Christianization of Europe]], where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during [[Early Christianity]]. Third, unlike words such as [[wikt:rusticitas|''rusticitas'']], ''paganus'' had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}}

''Paganus'' more likely acquired its meaning in Christian nomenclature via Roman military jargon (see above). Early Christians adopted military motifs and saw themselves as ''[[miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).&lt;ref name="etymonline_pagan"/&gt;{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}} A good example of Christians still using ''paganus'' in a military context rather than religious is in [[Tertullian]]'s ''De Corona Militis'' XI.V, where the Christian is referred to as ''paganus'' (''civilian''):{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}}
{|
 |style="padding-left: 6em; padding-right: 1em;"|''Apud hunc [Christum] tam miles est paganus fidelis quam paganus est miles fidelis.''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:la:De corona militis#11|''De Corona Militis'' XI.V]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 |style="padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 6em;"|With Him [Christ] the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/The Chaplet, or De Corona/Chapter XI|Ante-Nicene Fathers III, De Corona XI]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 |}

''Paganus'' acquired its religious connotations by the mid-4th century.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}} As early as the 5th century, ''paganos'' was metaphorically used to denote persons outside the bounds of the Christian community. Following the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] just over fifteen years after the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm "Theodosius I",'' The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; murmurs began to spread that the old gods had taken greater care of the city than the Christian God. In response, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[City of God (book)|''De Civitate Dei Contra Paganos'']] ('The City of God against the Pagans'). In it, he contrasted the fallen "city of Man" to the "city of God" of which all Christians were ultimately citizens. Hence, the foreign invaders were "not of the city" or "rural".&lt;ref&gt;"The City of God". [[Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orosius &lt;u&gt;Histories 1. Prol.&lt;/u&gt; ''"ui alieni a civitate dei..pagani vocantur."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Mohrmann, ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 6 (1952) 9ff; [http://dictionary.oed.com ''Oxford English Dictionary'', (online) 2nd Edition (1989)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pagan is not attested in the English language until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' instances [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', Vol. II, "Chapter XXI: Persecution of Heresy, State of the Church.—Part VII" (1776): "The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of {{sic|hide=y|reason=Gibbon capitalized here, though did not do so consistently throughout the work.|Paganism}}."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''[[wikt:infidel|infidel]]'' and ''[[wikt:heretic|heretic]]'', it was used as one of several [[pejorative]] Christian counterparts to ''[[wikt:gentile|gentile]]'' ({{lang|he|[[goy|גוי]]|rtl=yes}} / {{lang|he|נכרי|rtl=yes}}) as used in Judaism, and to ''[[kafir]]'' ({{lang|ar|كافر|rtl=yes}}, 'unbeliever') and ''[[mushrik]]'' ({{lang|ar|مشرك|rtl=yes}}, 'idolater') as in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt, S.N., 1983, Transcendental Visions – Other-Worldliness – and Its Transformations: Some More Comments on L. Dumont. ''Religion''13:1–17, at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellene===
{{Details|Hellenes (religion)}}

In the Latin-speaking [[Western Roman Empire]] of the newly [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|Christianizing Roman Empire]], [[Koine Greek]] became associated with the [[Religion in ancient Greece|traditional polytheistic religion]] of [[Ancient Greece]], and regarded as a foreign language (''lingua peregrina'') in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'' 1.14.23; Moatii, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter half of the 4th century in the Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]], pagans were—paradoxically—most commonly called ''Hellenes'' ({{lang|grc|Ἕλληνες}}, lit. 'Greeks'). The word almost entirely ceased being used in a cultural sense.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Alan G.|last2=Long|first2=Jacqueline|last3=Sherry|first3=Lee|title=Barbarians and Politics at the Court of Arcadius|year=1993|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520065505|pages=66–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9780520065505|chapter=2: Synesius of Cyrene; VI: The ''Dion''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16—17}} It retained that meaning for roughly the first millennium of Christianity.

This was influenced by Christianity's early members, who were [[Jewish Christian|Jewish]]. The Jews of the time distinguished themselves from foreigners according to religion rather than [[Ethnicity|ethno]]-[[Culture|cultural]] standards, and early Jewish Christians would have done the same. Because Hellenic culture was the dominant pagan culture in the Roman east, they called pagans Hellenes. Christianity inherited Jewish terminology for non-Jews and adapted it in order to refer to non-Christians with whom they were in contact. This usage is recorded in the [[New Testament]]. In the [[Pauline epistles]], ''Hellene'' is almost always juxtaposed with ''Hebrew'' regardless of actual ethnicities.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16—17}}

The usage of Hellene as a religious term was initially part of an exclusively Christian nomenclature, but some Pagans began to defiantly call themselves Hellenes. Other pagans even preferred the narrow meaning of the word:from a broad cultural sphere to a more specific religious grouping. However, there were many Christians and pagans alike who strongly objected to the evolution of the terminology. The influential [[Archbishop of Constantinople]] [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], for example, took offence at imperial efforts to suppress Hellenic culture (especially concerning spoken and written Greek) and he openly criticized the emperor.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"/&gt;

The growing religious stigmatization of Hellenism had a [[chilling effect]] on Hellenic culture by the late 4th century.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"/&gt;

By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a Hellene.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Swain, "Defending Hellenism: Philostratus, in Honour of Apollonius," in ''Apologetics,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The long-established use of Greek both in and around the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] as a [[lingua franca]] ironically allowed it to instead become central in enabling the spread of Christianity—as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Acta Conciliorum'' ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heathen===
Heathen comes from [[Old English]] ''hæðen'' (not Christian or Jewish); cf. [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|[[wikt:heiðinn|heiðinn]]}}. This meaning for the term originated from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got|[[wikt:haiþno|haiþno]]}} ([[gentile]] woman) being used to translate Hellene (cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:26|KJV}}) in [[Gothic Bible|Wulfila's Bible]], the first translation of the [[Bible]] into a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]. This may have been influenced by the Greek and Latin terminology of the time used for pagans. If so, it may be derived from Gothic {{lang|got|[[wikt:haiþi|haiþi]]}} (dwelling on the [[heath]]). However, this is not [[attested language|attested]]. It may even be a borrowing of Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἔθνος|ἔθνος]]}} ({{transl|el|ethnos}}) via [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|[[wikt:հեթանոս#Armenian|hethanos]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=heathen (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=heathen&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=18 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has recently been revived in the forms [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] and Heathenism (often but not always capitalized), as alternative names for the [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] movement, adherents of which may self-identify as Heathens.

==Definition==
{{quote|It is perhaps misleading even to say that there was such a religion as paganism at the beginning of [the Common Era] ... It might be less confusing to say that the pagans, before their competition with Christianity, had no religion at all in the sense in which that word is normally used today. They had no tradition of discourse about ritual or religious matters (apart from philosophical debate or antiquarian treatise), no organized system of beliefs to which they were asked to commit themselves, no authority-structure peculiar to the religious area, above all no commitment to a particular group of people or set of ideas other than their family and political context. If this is the right view of pagan life, it follows that we should look on paganism quite simply as a religion invented in the course of the second to third centuries AD, in competition and interaction with Christians, Jews and others.|North 1992, 187—88|{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=26—27}}}}

Defining paganism is problematic. Understanding the context of its associated terminology is important.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}} [[Early Christian]]s referred to the diverse array of [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] around them as a single group for reasons of convenience and [[rhetoric]].{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=26}} While paganism generally implies [[polytheism]], the primary distinction between classical pagans and Christians was not one of [[monotheism]] versus polytheism. Not all pagans were strictly polytheist. Throughout history, many of them believed in a [[Supreme Being|supreme]] [[deity]]. (However, most such pagans believed in a class of subordinate gods/[[daimon]]s—see [[henotheism]]—or divine [[emanation]]s.){{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=28, 30}} To Christians, the most important distinction was whether or not someone worshipped the ''[[one true God]]''. Those who did not (polytheist, monotheist, or  [[atheist]]) were outsiders to the [[Christian Church|Church]] and thus pagan.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=27, 31}} Similarly, classical pagans would have found it peculiar to distinguish groups by the number of [[deities]] followers venerate. They would have considered the priestly colleges (such as the [[College of Pontiffs]] or [[Epulones]]) and cult practices more meaningful distinctions.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=29}}

Referring to paganism as pre-Christian indigenous religions is equally untenable. Not all historical pagan traditions were pre-Christian or indigenous to their places of worship.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}}

Owing to the history of its nomenclature, paganism traditionally encompasses the collective pre- and non-Christian cultures in and around the [[classical world]]; including those of the Greco-Roman, Celtic, Germanic, Slavic tribes.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=28}} However, modern parlance of [[folklorist]]s and [[contemporary pagan]]s in particular has extended the original four millennia scope used by early Christians to include similar religious traditions stretching far into [[prehistory]].{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Chapter 1: The ancient world}}

==Perception==
Paganism came to be equated by Christians with a sense of hedonism, representing those who are sensual, materialistic, self-indulgent, unconcerned with the future, and uninterested in more mainstream religions. Pagans were usually described within this worldly [[stereotype]], especially among those drawing attention to what they perceived as the limitations of paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote: "The {{sic|hide=y|reason=Chesterton used "pagan", lower case; verified with source.|pagan}} set out, with admirable sense, to enjoy himself. By the end of his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and continue to enjoy anything else." In sharp contrast, [[Swinburne]] the poet would comment on this same theme: "Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death."&lt;ref&gt;'Hymn to Proserpine'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
{{main article|Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Roman religion|Hellenistic religion|Roman imperial cult}}
[[Ludwig Feuerbach]] defined the paganism of [[classical antiquity]], which he termed {{lang|de|Heidentum}} ('heathenry') as "the unity of religion and politics, of spirit and nature, of god and man",&lt;ref&gt;cf. the civil, natural and mythical theologies of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; qualified by the observation that man in the pagan view is always defined by [[ethnicity]], i.e. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jew, etc., so that each pagan tradition is also a national tradition. Modern historians define paganism instead as the aggregate of cult acts, set within a civic rather than a national context, without a written creed or sense of [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;A summary of the modern view is given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' 1989, pp. 31 ''ff.'': "The modern emphasis on {{sic|hide=y|reason=Fox appears to have used "pagan", lower case, per external sources quoting him.|paganism}}'s cult acts was also acknowledged by {{sic|hide=y|pagans}} themselves. It shaped the way they tried and tested Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

The developments in the religious thought of the far-flung [[Roman Empire]] during [[Late Antiquity]] needs to be addressed separately, because this is the context in which [[Early Christianity]] itself developed as one of several monotheistic cults, and it was in this period that the concept of pagan developed in the first place. As Christianity emerged from [[Second Temple Judaism]] (or [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), it stood in competition with other religions advocating pagan monotheism, including the cult of [[Dionysus]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''
"two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E. [...]  the particular iconography of Hermes and Dionysos in the panel of the Epiphany of Dionysos [...] represents the culmination of a {{sic|hide=y|reason=Kessler capitalized; verified with source.|Pagan}} iconographic tradition in which an infant divinity is seated on the lap of another divine figure; this {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} motif was appropriated by early Christian artists and developed into the standardized icon of the Virgin and Child. Thus the mosaic helps to substantiate the existence of {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} monotheism."  [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1-hBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoplatonism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Manichaeanism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Dionysus]] in particular exhibits significant parallels with Christ, so that numerous scholars have concluded that the recasting of [[historical Jesus|Jesus the wandering rabbi]] into the image of [[Christ the Logos]], the divine saviour, reflects the cult of Dionysus directly. They point to the symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 6. 26. 1 – 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophistae'' 2. 34a&lt;/ref&gt;  Wick argues that the use of [[wine]] [[religious symbolism|symbolism]] in the [[Gospel of John]], including the story of the [[Marriage at Cana]] at which Jesus turns water into wine, was intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.&lt;ref name="Wick 2004 179–198"/&gt;  The scene in ''The Bacchae'' wherein Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name="Wick 2004 179–198"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wick |first=Peter |title=Jesus gegen Dionysos?

===Early Modern period===
Interest in pagan traditions was first revived during the [[Renaissance]], when [[Renaissance magic]] was practiced as a revival of [[Greco-Roman magic]]. In the 17th century, the description of paganism turned from the theological aspect to the [[ethnology|ethnological]] one, and religions began to be understood as a part of the [[ethnic]] identities of peoples, and the study of the religions of so-called primitive peoples triggered questions as to the ultimate historical [[origin of religion]]. Thus, [[Nicolas Fabri de Peiresc]] saw the pagan [[religions of Africa]] of his day as relics that were in principle capable of shedding light on the historical paganism of Classical Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;"It would be a great pleasure to make the comparison with what survives to us of ancient {{sic|hide=y|reason=Miller used lower case; verified with online copy found in search results.|paganism}} in our old books, in order to have better [grasped] their spirit." Peter N. Miller, ''History of Religion Becomes Ethnology: Some Evidence from Peiresc's Africa'' Journal of the History of Ideas 67.4 (2006) 675–696.[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_ideas/v067/67.4miller.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{rquote|right|Great God! I'd rather be&lt;br&gt;A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;&lt;br&gt;So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,&lt;br&gt;Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;&lt;br&gt;Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;&lt;br&gt;Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.|[[William Wordsworth]], "[[The World Is Too Much with Us]]", lines 9-14}}

Paganism resurfaces as a topic of fascination in 18th to 19th-century [[Romanticism]], in particular in the context of the literary [[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] and [[Viking Revival|Viking]] revivals, which portrayed historical [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and [[Germanic polytheism|Germanic]] polytheists as [[noble savage]]s.

The 19th century also saw much scholarly interest in the reconstruction of pagan mythology from folklore or fairy tales. This was notably attempted by the [[Brothers Grimm]], especially [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'', and [[Elias Lönnrot]] with the compilation of the ''[[Kalevala]]''. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.  Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of [[Romantic nationalism]] and the rise of the [[nation state]] in the context of the [[1848 revolutions]], leading to the creation of ''[[national epic]]s'' and [[national myth]]s for the various newly formed states. Pagan or folkloric topics were also common in the [[Musical nationalism]] of the period.

==Modern Paganism==
{{anchor|Neopaganism}}
{{Main article|Modern Paganism}}
[[File:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|Some [[megalith]]s are believed to have religious significance.]]
[[File:Lady of Cornwall.jpg|thumb|Children standing with ''The Lady of Cornwall'' in a neopagan ceremony in England]]
[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|Neopagan [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony at Avebury (Beltane 2005)]]

[[Modern Paganism]], or Neopaganism, includes [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructed religions]] such as [[Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism]], [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], [[Slavic Native Faith]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], or [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], as well as modern eclectic traditions such as [[Wicca]] and its many offshoots, [[Neo-Druidism]], and [[Discordianism]].

However, there often exists a distinction or separation between some polytheistic reconstructionists such as Hellenism and revivalist Neopagans like Wiccans.  The divide is over numerous issues such as the importance of accurate [[orthopraxy]] according to ancient sources available, the use and concept of magic, which calendar to use and which holidays to observe, as well as the use of the term pagan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-faq.php#4|title=Hellenismos FAQ |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sceh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=faq#24|title=Pagans|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wyrdwords.vispa.com/heathenry/callusheathen.html|title=Call us Heathens!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Journal of the Pagan Federation|year=1997|author=Arlea Anschütz, Stormerne Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the revivals, Wicca and Neo-Druidism in particular, have their roots in 19th century [[Romanticism]] and retain noticeable elements of [[occultism]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that were current then, setting them apart from historical rural ({{lang|la|paganus}}) folk religion. Most modern pagans, however, believe in the divine character of the natural world and paganism is often described as an Earth religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20693321|title=Pagan beliefs: nature, druids and witches|work=BBC Religion &amp; Ethics|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A copy of the Thor's hammer from Skåne - Nachbildung des Thorshammers von Skåne 02.jpg|right|thumb|The hammer [[Mjölnir]] is one of the primary symbols of [[Germanic neopaganism]].]]

There are a number of neopagan authors who have examined the relation of the 20th-century movements of polytheistic revival with historical polytheism on one hand and contemporary traditions of folk religion on the other. [[Isaac Bonewits]] introduced a terminology to make this distinction.&lt;ref name="Defs"&gt;[http://www.neopagan.net/PaganDefs.html "Defining Paganism: Paleo-, Meso-, and Neo-"](Version 2.5.1) 1979, 2007 c.e., Isaac Bonewits&lt;/ref&gt;

;Paleopaganism: A [[retronym]] coined to contrast with [[Neopaganism]], original polytheistic, nature-centered faiths, such as the pre-Hellenistic [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and pre-imperial [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], pre-Migration period [[Germanic paganism]] as described by [[Tacitus]], or [[Celtic polytheism]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]].
;Mesopaganism: A group, which is, or has been, significantly influenced by monotheistic, dualistic, or nontheistic worldviews, but has been able to maintain an independence of religious practices. This group includes [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal Americans]] as well as [[Australian aborigines]], [[Viking Age]] [[Norse paganism]] and [[New Age]] spirituality.  Influences include: [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], and the many Afro-Diasporic faiths like [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Santería]] and Espiritu religion. [[Isaac Bonewits]] includes [[British Traditional Wicca]] in this subdivision.
;[[Neopaganism]]: A movement by modern people to revive nature-revering/living, pre-Christian religions or other nature-based spiritual paths, frequently also incorporating contemporary [[liberalism|liberal]] values{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} at odds with ancient paganism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This definition may include groups such as [[Wicca]], Neo-Druidism, Heathenry, and Slavic Native Faith.

Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick in their ''A History of Pagan Europe'' (1995) classify pagan religions as characterized by the following traits:
*[[Polytheism]]: Pagan religions recognise a plurality of divine beings, which may or may not be considered aspects of an underlying unity (the [[Polytheism#Soft_polytheism_versus_hard_polytheism|soft and hard polytheism]] distinction).
*[[Earth religion|Nature-based]]: Pagan religions have a concept of the divinity of [[nature]],  which they view as a manifestation of the divine, not as the fallen creation found in [[dualistic cosmology]].
*[[Sacred feminine]]: Pagan religions recognize the female divine principle, identified as  [[Goddess movement|the Goddess]] (as opposed to individual [[goddesses]]) beside or in place of the male divine principle as expressed in the Abrahamic [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Prudence; Pennick, Nigel (1995). ''A History of Pagan Europe''. Page 2. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, Heathen and Heathenry are increasingly used to refer to those branches of neopaganism inspired by the pre-Christian religions of the Germanic, Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/paganism/subdivisions/heathenry_1.shtml|title=Paganism: Heathenry|work=BBC – Religions|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iceland]], the members of ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'' account for 0.4% of the total population,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Iceland – [http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1180&amp;src=/temp_en/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Populations+by+religious+organizations+1990-2008+%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=1%26units=Number Statistics &gt;&gt; Population &gt;&gt; Religious organisations]&lt;/ref&gt; which is just over a thousand people. In [[Lithuania]], many people practice [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a revived version of the pre-Christian religion of that country. Lithuania was among the last areas of Europe to be Christianized. [[Odinism]] has been established on a formal basis in [[Australia]] since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odinicriteofaustralia.wordpress.com/|title=The Odinic Rite of Australia|work=The Odinic Rite of Australia|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The description '''person of faith''' (plural: '''people of faith''') refers to any person who can be delineated or classified by an adherence to a religious tradition or doctrine, as opposed to those who do not publicly identify or in any way espouse a religious path. The term '''people of faith''' has been increasingly used in the 20th and 21st century by religious adherents in Westernized countries who are critical of a perceived increase in public disenchantment or de-emphasis upon accommodation for religious adherents, although the term itself is used more as a catch-all term which is intentionally non-denominational or non-specific to any particular religious path.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A person of faith is said to belong to a '''faith community''' or '''faith-based community'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith community|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/faith-community|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith-based|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith-based|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also criticized by advocates of nontheistic positions for being inaccurate in its assumption of an underlying, unifying commonality between all religious observants - despite stark doctrinal differences and oppositional stances - simply for the purpose of reducing the influence of secular-minded individuals (similar to the term [[person of color]] as a catch-all descriptor of non-white persons, or the Islamic description of [[people of the Book]] to describe the communities of adherents to Islam, Christianity and Judaism).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In [[religion]], a '''prophet''' is an individual regarded as being in contact with a [[divinity|divine being]] and said to speak on that entity's behalf, serving as an intermediary with humanity by delivering messages or teachings from the [[supernatural]] source to other people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prophet prophet – definition of prophet by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/prophet prophet – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The message that the prophet conveys is called a [[prophecy]].

Claims of prophethood have existed in many cultures through history, including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], in [[ancient Greek religion]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]], and many others.

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word נָבִיא (''nāvî''), "spokesperson", traditionally translates as "prophet".&lt;ref&gt;p.1571, Alcalay. An alternative translation of this Hebrew word is derived from an Akkadian word "nabu," meaning to call. The Hebrew "navi" has a passive sense and means "the one who has been called" (see HALOT, p.661).&lt;/ref&gt; The second subdivision of the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Tanakh|TaNaKh]] (for "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim"), is devoted to the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of ''navi'' is perhaps described in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 18:18,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[God]] said, "...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." Thus, the ''navi'' was thought to be the "mouth" of God. The root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|bet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Duccio di Buoninsegna 066.jpg|thumb|[[Malachi]], one of the last prophets of Israel, painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, c. 1310 (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, [[Siena Cathedral]]). ''“He &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mashiach]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents” (Malachi 4:6)''&lt;ref&gt;cf. “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; disciple.” ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 14:26)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In addition to writing and speaking messages from God, [[Israelites|Israelite]] or [[Jews|Jewish]] nevi'im ("spokespersons", "prophets") often acted out prophetic parables in their life.&lt;ref&gt;All the Parables of the Bible, Herbert Lockyer, Zondervan, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to contrast the people’s disobedience with the obedience of the [[Rechabite]]s, God has [[Jeremiah]] invite the Rechabites to drink wine, in disobedience to their ancestor’s command. The Rechabites refuse, wherefore God commends them.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 35:13–16, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 35, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other prophetic parables acted out by Jeremiah include burying a linen belt so that it gets ruined to illustrate how God intends to ruin Judah's pride.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cj13"&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 13, Jeremiah, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cj13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah, Lamentations, Tremper Longman, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Jeremiah buys a clay jar and smashes it in the [[Gehenna|Valley of Ben Hinnom]] in front of elders and priests to illustrate that God will smash the [[Kingdom of Judah|nation of Judah]] and the city of Judah beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 19, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; God instructs Jeremiah to make a yoke from wood and leather straps and to put it on his own neck to demonstrate how God will put the nation under the yoke of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], king of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 27–28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the prophet [[Isaiah]] had to walk stripped and barefoot for three years to illustrate the coming captivity,&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 20, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and the prophet [[Ezekiel]] had to lie on his side for 390 days and eat measured food to illustrate the coming siege.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophetic assignment is not always portrayed as positive in the Hebrew Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Isaiah (Commentary), John Goldingay, Hendrickson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Isaiah 6:8–13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and prophets were often the target of persecution and opposition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;’’Jeremiah (Prophet)’’, The Anchor Bible Dictionary Volume 3, Doubleday, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; God’s personal prediction for Jeremiah, "Attack you they will, overcome you they can't,"&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 1:19, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; was performed many times in the [[Bible prophecy|biblical narrative]] as Jeremiah warned of destruction of those who continued to refuse repentance and accept more moderate consequences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’’Jeremiah, Lamentations’’, F.B. Huey, Broadman Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In return for his adherence to God’s discipline and speaking God’s words, Jeremiah was attacked by his own brothers,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 12:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; beaten and put into the stocks by a priest and [[false prophet]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 20:1–4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995, p. 1501&lt;/ref&gt; imprisoned by the king,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 37:18, Jeremiah 38:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; threatened with death,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; thrown into a cistern by Judah’s officials,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed by a false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Isaiah was told by his hearers who rejected his message, "Leave the way! Get off the path! Let us hear no more about the [[Book of Isaiah#"Holy One of Israel"|Holy One of Israel]]!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 30:11, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Moses being threatened by [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]] is another example.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2, Exodus 10:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to I [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 9:9,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|105}}, Hebrew – English Bible&lt;/ref&gt; the old name for navi is ''ro'eh'', רֹאֶה, which literally means "Seer". That could document an ancient shift, from viewing prophets as seers for hire to viewing them as moral teachers. Allen (1971) comments that in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] Era, there were essentially seer-priests, who formed a guild, [[divination|divined]], performed rituals and sacrifices, and were scribes, and then there were canonical prophets, who did none of these (and were against divination) and had instead a message to deliver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seer-priests were usually attached to a local shrine or temple, such as [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], and initiated others as priests in that priesthood: it was a mystical craft-guild with apprentices and recruitment. Canonical prophets were not organised this way. The similar term ''ben-navi'' ("son of the prophet") means "member of a seer-priest guild".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some examples of prophets in the Tanakh include [[Abraham]], Moses, [[Miriam]], Isaiah, [[Samuel]], Ezekiel, [[Malachi]], and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]. In Jewish tradition [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] is not counted in the list of prophets.

A Jewish tradition suggests that there were twice as many prophets as the number which left Egypt, which would make 1,200,000 prophets.&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; The [[Talmud]] recognizes the existence of [[Prophets in Judaism#The 48 Prophets|48 male prophets]] who bequeathed permanent messages to mankind.&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; According to the Talmud there were also seven women who are counted as prophetesses whose message bears relevance for all generations: [[Sarah]], [[Miriam]], [[Deborah|Devorah]], [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] (mother of the prophet Samuel), [[Abigail]] (a wife of [[David|King David]]), [[Huldah]] (from the time of Jeremiah), and [[Esther]].&lt;ref name="jfaq"/&gt; The Jewish Rabbi [[Rashi]] points out that [[Rebecca]], [[Rachel]], and [[Leah]] were also prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi on Genesis 29:34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her name isn't elsewhere specified.

Prophets in Tanakh are not always Jews.&lt;ref name="jfaq"&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm Prophets and Prophecy]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Balaam]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22 describes a non-Jewish prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|24:1–24:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, [[Obadiah]] is said to have been a convert to Judaism.

The last nevi'im ("spokespersons", "prophets") mentioned in the [[Jewish Bible]] are [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]], all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. The [[Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a) states that Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists.

==== Traditional definitions ====
In [[Christianity]] a prophet (or seer)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|9}}, [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; is one inspired by God through the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] to deliver a message for a specific purpose. God's calling of someone as a prophet does not have the purpose of to elevating an individual for their own glory, but for the glory of God and to turn people to him.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Some [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] limit a prophet's message to words intended only for the entire church congregation, excluding personal messages not intended for the body of believers; but in the [[Bible]] on a number of occasions prophets were called to deliver personal messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:1–7|9}}, {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|3:11|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of a message is termed [[revelation]] and the delivery of the message is termed prophecy.

The term "prophet" applies to those who receive public or private revelation. Public revelation, in Catholicism, is part of the [[Deposit of faith]], the revelation of which was completed by Jesus; whereas Private Revelation does not add to the Deposit. The term "deposit of faith" refers to the entirety of Jesus Christ's revelation, and is passed to successive generations in two different forms, sacred scripture (the Bible) and sacred tradition.

The Bible terms anyone who claims to speak God's words or to teach in his name without being a prophet a [[false prophet]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} One [[Old Testament]] text  in the [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:21–22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a warning against those who prophesy events which do not come to pass and says they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may be someone who is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of [[Satan]] or is speaking from his own spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|13:3|9}}, "Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!"&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ongoing prophecy ? ====
[[File:Mattia Preti - San Giovanni Battista Predicazione.jpg|thumb|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'', {{circa|1665}}, by [[Mattia Preti]]]]
Some Christians who believe in [[dispensationalism]] believe prophecy ended (along with the rest of the sign gifts) shortly after the coming of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who delivered the "[[Biblical law in Christianity |fullness of the law]]". Within this group, many Protestants believe that prophecy ended with the last of the Hebrew prophets of the [[Hebrew Bible]], leaving a gap of about 400 years between then and the life of Jesus. The majority of Christians, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], allow an exception for [[John the Baptist]] as a prophet contemporary with Jesus.

[[New Testament]] passages that explicitly discuss prophets existing after the death and resurrection of [[Christ]] include [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:10,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Revelation|11:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:40–41 and 23:34,&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|10:40–41|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|23:34|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of John|John]] 13:20 and 15:20&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John {{Bibleverse-nb||John|13:20|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||John|15:20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:25–30, 13:1 and 15:32.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Apostles {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|11:25–30|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:1|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:32|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to lead a [[Christian worship |Christian life]] and to give gifts (i.e. abilities) to Christians. These may include the [[charism]]atic gifts such as prophecy, [[Glossolalia|tongues]], [[faith healing| miraculous healing]] ability, and [[clairsentience]]. Christians holding a view known as [[cessationism]] believe that these gifts were given only in New Testament times and that they ceased after the last [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle died]].

The ''[[Didache]]'' gives extensive instruction in how to distinguish between true and false prophets, as well as commands regarding tithes to prophets in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html Early Christian Writings: Didache (Chapters 11–15)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], wrote of 2nd-century believers with the gift of prophecy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103506.htm ''Against Heresies'', Book V Chapter 6.1]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Justin Martyr]] argued in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' that prophets were not found among the Jews in his time, but that the church had prophets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html Early Christian Writings: ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (Chapter LXXXII)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'' describes revelation in a vision regarding the proper operation of prophecy in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd.html Early Christian Writings: Shepherd of Hermas (Eleventh Commandment)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius of Caesarea |Eusebius]] mentions that [[Quadratus of Athens| Quadratus]] and Ammia of [[Alaşehir| Philadelphia]] were both prominent prophets following the age of the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book III, Chapter 37.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book V, Chapter 17.2–4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], writing of the church meetings of the [[Montanism|Montanists]] (to whom he belonged), described in detail the practice of prophecy in the 2nd-century church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm ''A Treatise on the Soul'', Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of later Christian saints were claimed{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Columba of Iona]] (521-597), [[Saint Malachy]] (1094-1148) or [[Padre Pio]] (1887-1968). [[Marian apparition]]s like those at [[Fátima, Portugal | Fatima]] in 1917 or at [[Kibeho]] in Rwanda in the 1980s often included prophetic predictions regarding the future of the world as well as of the local areas they occurred in.&lt;ref&gt;http://marianapparitions.org/marian_apparitions/index.html, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophetic movements in particular can be traced throughout the Christian Church's history, expressing themselves in (for example) [[Montanism]], [[Novatianism]], [[Donatism]], [[Franciscan]]ism, [[Anabaptist|Anabaptism]], [[Camisard]] enthusiasm, [[Puritan]]ism, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]], [[Lutheranism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/products/book/lay-prophets-lutheran-europe-c-1550-1700 Jürgen Beyer, ''Lay prophets in Lutheran Europe (c. 1550–1700)'' (Brill's series in church history and religious culture 74), Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pietism]].  Modern Pentecostals and Charismatics, members of movements which together comprised approximately 584 million people {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf ''Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population''], p. 67. See also ''The New International Dictionary'', "Part II Global Statistics: A Massive Worldwide Phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; believe in the contemporary function of the gift of prophecy, and some in these movements allow for idea that God may continue to gift the church with some individuals who are prophets.  

Some Christians also believe that the title "prophet" encompasses others than those who receive visions from God. A more modern definition of prophet is someone who spreads God's truths.{{cn|date=September 2018}} These can be revealed in a number of ways, not only visions.

Some Christian sects recognize the existence of a "modern-day" prophet. One such denomination is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which teaches that God still communicates with mankind through prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;
Whether or not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is considered a Christian denomination is subject to dispute, see [[Mormonism and Christianity]].

{{Islamic prophets}}
{{Main article|Prophets and messengers in Islam}}

The [[Quran]] identifies a number of men as "Prophets of Islam" ({{lang-ar|نبي}} ''nabī''; pl. {{lang|ar|أنبياء}} ''anbiyāʾ''). [[Muslim]]s believe such individuals were assigned a special mission by [[God in Islam|God]] to guide humanity. Besides [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], this includes prophets such as [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham (''Ibrāhīm'')]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses (''Mūsā'')]] () and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus (''ʿĪsā'')]].

Other traditions place the number of prophets at 224,000. Some scholars hold that there are an even greater number in the history of mankind, and only God knows. The Qur'an says that God has sent a prophet to every group of people throughout time, and that Muhammad is the last of the prophets, sent for the whole of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message of all the prophets is believed to be the same. In Islam, all prophetic messengers are prophets (such as [[Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]]) though not all prophets are prophetic messengers. The primary distinction is that a prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions, character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, while a prophetic messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him. Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the prophetic messengers and prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the prophetic messenger to all of mankind. Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings) and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Biblical narratives and the Qur'an]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims often refer to Muhammad as "the Prophet", in the form of a noun.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary''. p. 1111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion, William A. Graham, William Albert Graham – 1993, p93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The militia – Page 100, James B. Whisker – 1992 "The work of Mohammed (569–632), commonly called the Prophet, the Koran was revealed in a series of visions over a period of many years beginning in 610"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz’ 26 (Part 26): Al-Ahqaf 1 To Az-Zariyat 30, Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman – 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is the result of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] in Islam as in Christianity, and is regarded as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, four prophets are believed to have been sent [[Islamic holy books|holy books]]: the [[Torah in Islam|Torah (''Tawrat'')]] to Moses, the [[Zabur|Psalms (''Zābūr'')]] to David, the [[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]] to Jesus, and the Qur'an to Muhammad; those prophets are considered "Messengers" or ''rasūl''. Other main prophets are considered messengers or ''nabī'', even if they didn't receive a Book from God. Examples include the messenger-prophet [[Aaron#Islam|Aaron| (''Hārūn'')]], the messenger-prophet [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael (''Ismāʿīl'')]]) and the messenger-prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph (''Yūsuf'')]].

Although it offers many incidents from the lives of many prophets, the Qur'an focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five major prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, Moses is referred to most frequently in the Qur'an. As for the fifth, the [[Qur'an]] is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer still is the mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Main article|Manifestation of God}}

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] refers to what are commonly called prophets as "Manifestations of God" who are directly linked with the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as "Manifestations of God" or "divine educators".&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 737–740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world. Thus they are seen as an intermediary between God and humanity.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God, and are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt;

In addition to the Manifestations of God, there are also minor prophets. While the Manifestations of God, or major prophets, are compared to the Sun (which produces its own heat and light), minor prophets are compared to the Moon (which receives its light from the sun). Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14–17).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:14–17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish prophets are considered minor prophets, as they are considered to have come in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.

== Prophetic claims in movements deriving from Abrahamic religions ==
In modern times the term "prophet" can be somewhat controversial. Many Christians with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic beliefs]] believe in the continuation of the gift of prophecy and the continuation of the role of prophet as taught in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ephesians|4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of prophecies can vary widely. Prophecies are often spoken as quotes from God. They may contain quotes from scripture, statements about the past or current situation, or predictions of the future. Prophecies can also 'make manifest the secrets' of the hearts of other people, telling about the details of their lives. Sometimes, more than one person in a congregation will receive the same message in prophecy, with one giving it before another.

Other movements claim to have prophets. In France, Michel Potay says he received a revelation, called ''The Revelation of Arès'', dictated by Jesus in 1974, then by God in 1977. He is considered a prophet by his followers, the [[Pilgrims of Arès]].

===Catholicism ===

A number of modern catholic saints have been claimed to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Padre Pio]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/man/biography2.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ALEXDRIN.HTM, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this many modern [[Marian apparition]]s included prophecies in them about the world and about the local areas. The [[Three Secrets of Fátima|Fátima apparition]] in 1917 included a prophecy given by Mary to three children, that on October 13, 1917 there would be a great miracle for all to see at [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]], Portugal, and on that day tens of thousands of people headed to Fátima to see what would happen including newspaper journalists. Many witnesses, including journalists, claimed to see the sun "dance" in the sky in the afternoon of that day, exactly as the visionaries had predicted several months before.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ewtn.com/fatima/sixth-apparition-of-our-lady.asp, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Our Lady of Kibeho|Kibeho apparition]] in [[Rwanda]] in the 1980s included many prophecies about great violence and destruction that was coming, and the [[Rwandan genocide]] only ten years later was interpreted by the visionaries as the fulfilment of these prophecies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.michaeljournal.org/kibeho.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Several miracles and a vision of the [[Prophecy of the Popes|identity of the last 112 Popes]] were attributed to [[Saint Malachy]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh]] (1095–1148).

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
{{See also|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not consider any single person in their modern-day organization to be a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/images/88f.gif |title=The Watchtower, Number 7, Vol. XCIII |accessdate=2009-09-12 |date=1972-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their literature has referred to their organization collectively as God's "prophet" on earth; this is understood, however, in the sense of declaring their interpretation of God's judgments from the Bible along with God's guidance of His Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', 2008 Watch Tower, page 209, "Today, prophesying would apply to any Bible-based teaching that a Christian minister does."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Would That All Were Prophets!”, ''Awake!'', Watch Tower, June 8, 1986, page 9, "True Christians are prophets in that they teach others God’s Word"&lt;/ref&gt; Their publishing company, [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower]], and official position magazine, ''[[The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower]]'', have asserted: "Ever since ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' began to be published in July 1879 it has looked ahead into the future... No, ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is no inspired prophet, but it follows and explains a Book of prophecy the predictions in which have proved to be unerring and unfailing till now. ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is therefore under safe guidance. It may be read with confidence, for its statements may be checked against that prophetic Book."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower 1 January 1969''&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that they are God's one and only true channel to mankind on earth, and used by God for this purpose.

They have made many [[Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses|eschatological forecasts]], some of which have led people (including followers) to incorrect assumptions. One example is ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower's'' assertions that the end of the "[[Gentile#LDS Church usage|Gentile]] times" or "times of the nations" would occur in 1914; even prominent Watch Tower representatives such as [[Alexander Hugh Macmillan#Macmillan's proclamation of 1914|A. H. Macmillan]] incorrectly concluded and overstated their expectations. As a result, ''The Watchtower'' has acknowledged that Jehovah's Witnesses "have made mistakes in their understanding of what would occur at the end of certain time periods."&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with these exceptions, Jehovah's Witnesses in their literature and assemblies have taught their leadership was personally chosen by Jesus Christ in 1919 (a prophetic year in Jehovah's Witnesses eschatology) and that they are "God's sole channel on earth," and "Jehovah's spirit directed organization".

=== Founders of Christian sects or movements ===

==== Latter Day Saint ====
[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Joseph Smith]]]]

{{Main article|Prophet, seer, and revelator|President of the Church|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[Joseph Smith]], who established the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in 1830, is considered a prophet by members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], of which [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the largest denomination. Additionally, many churches within the movement believe in a succession of modern prophets (accepted by Latter Day Saints as "[[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]") since the time of Joseph Smith. [[Russell M. Nelson]] is the current president and prophet of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

==== Adventism ====
[[Baptism|Baptist]] preacher [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] is credited with beginning the mid-19th century North American religious movement now known as [[Adventism]]. He announced a [[Second Coming]], resulting in the [[Great Disappointment]].

===== Seventh-day Adventist =====
{{Main article|Inspiration of Ellen G. White}}

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], established in 1863, believes [[Ellen G. White]], one of the church's founders, was given the [[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|spiritual gift of prophecy]].

===== Branch Davidians =====

The [[Branch Davidians]] sect evolved from the Seventh-Day Adventists Church. [[David Koresh]], who died in the well-known [[Waco Siege]] in 1993, in 1983 claimed to be their final prophet and [[List of people claimed to be Jesus#20th century|"the Son of God, the Lamb"]].

=== Judaic messianism ===
[[Nathan of Gaza]] was a theologian and author who became famous as a prophet for the alleged messiah, [[Sabbatai Zevi]].

== Other religions ==

=== Hinduism ===
The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] concept of [[rishis]] is similar to the concept of prophets. The Sanskrit word ''rishi'' is loosely translated into English as "seer" (a prophet, a man who can foresee the future). Hinduism recognizes and reveres thousands of rishis, who can be thought of as the collective founders of the Hindu religion over many millennia. Of these, special importance is given to the [[Saptarshi]] (the Seven Sages), widely regarded as patriarchs of the Hindu religion, whose listing is different according to different texts. The Saptarshi and their clans are believed to have composed the hymns of the four [[Vedas]] by entering into communion with the Supreme Cosmic Spirit through meditation. For instance, [[Rigveda]] 1.1 is attributed to Rishi Madhucchandā Vaishwāmitra (i.e. Madhucchandā of the clan of [[Vishwamitra]]). Most rishikās were male, but some were female too. [[Lopamudra]] is the author of one hymn in the Rigveda, and [[Gargi Vachaknavi]] is described in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] as a highly respected woman in the field of Brahmajñāna. Apart from the Vedas, various rishis are also credited with composing the several [[Smriti]] texts, like [[Veda Vyasa]] who composed the ''[[Mahābhārata]]''.

=== Ifa and other African traditional religions ===
{{main|Traditional African religion|Ifá|Religion in Africa}}

[[Divination]] remains an important aspect of the lives of the people of contemporary [[Africa]], especially amongst the usually rural, socially traditionalistic segments of its population. In arguably its most influential manifestation, the system of prophecy practiced by the [[Babalawo]]s and [[Iyanifa]]s of the historically [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] regions of [[West Africa]] have bequeathed to the world a corpus of [[fortune-telling]] poetic methodologies so intricate that they have been added by [[UNESCO]] to its official ''[[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage of the World list]]''.

=== Tenrikyo ===
[[Tenrikyo]]'s prophet, [[Nakayama Miki]], is believed by Tenrikyoans to have been a messenger of God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133710/http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/eng/?page_id=104 oyasama]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, revelator, and mystic.

== Native Americans ==
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Great Peacemaker]] (Deganawidah) co-founded the [[Iroquois#Iroquois Confederacy|Haudenosaunee league]] in [[pre-Columbian]] times. In retrospect, his [[Great Peacemaker#Prophecy of the boy seer|prophecy of the boy seer]] could appear to refer to the conflict between natives and Europeans (white serpent).

From 1805 until the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] that falsified his predictions in 1811, the "[[Shawnee]] prophet" [[Tenskwatawa]] lead an Indian alliance to stop Europeans to take more and more land going west. He reported [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s he had. He is said to have accurately predicted a [[solar eclipse]]. His brother [[Tecumseh]] re-established the alliance for [[Tecumseh's War]], that ended with the latter's death in 1813. Tecumseh fought together with British forces that, in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], occupied essentially today's territory of [[Canada]].

[[Francis the Prophet]], influenced by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, was a leader of the [[Red Stick]] faction of the [[Muscogee|Creek]] Indians. He traveled to England in 1815 as a representative of the "four Indian nations" in an unsuccessful attempt to get Great Britain to help them resist the expansionism of the white settlers.

20 years later (1832), [[Wabokieshiek]], the "[[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] Prophet", after whom [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]] has been named, (also called "White Cloud") claimed that British forces would support the Indians in the [[Black Hawk War]] against the United States as 20 years earlier (based on "visions"). They did not, and no longer he was considered a "prophet".

In 1869, the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[Wodziwob]] founded the [[Ghost Dance]] movement. The dance rituals were an occasion to announce his visions of an earthquake that would swallow the whites. He seems to have died in 1872.

The [[Northern Paiute]] [[Wovoka]] claimed he had a vision during the [[solar eclipse]] of January 1, 1889, that the Paiute dead would come back and the whites would vanish from America, provided the natives performed [[Ghost Dance]]s. This idea spread among other Native American peoples. The government were worried about a rebellion and sent troops, which lead to the death of [[Sitting Bull]] and to the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890.

== Secular usage ==
In the late 20th century the appellation of ''prophet'' has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory ''prophet of greed''. Alternatively, social commentators who suggest escalating crisis are often called ''prophets of doom.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ruff sees more rough times ahead – MarketWatch | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ruff-sees-more-rough-times/story.aspx?guid=%7B0354D5FB%2D2AE2%2D48CB%2DA7F0%2D4B06FBE5EE61%7D&amp;dist=TNMostRead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nouriel Roubini: I fear the worst is yet to come – Times Online | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5014463.ece | quote = ...after making a series of uncannily accurate predictions about the global meltdown, Roubini has become the prophet of his age... | work=The Times | location=London | first=Dominic | last=Rushe | date=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==

===Genes and environment===

[[File:Church Attendance and Welfare Spending Graph.png|thumb|350px|National welfare spending vs church attendance in Christian societies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

==Islamic exclusivism==
{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20542">'''Religious Identity''' is a specific type of [[identity formation]]. Particularly, it is the sense of group membership to a religion and the importance of this group membership as it pertains to one's [[self-concept]]. Religious identity is not necessarily the same as religiousness or [[religiosity]]. Although these three terms share a commonality, religiousness and religiosity refer to both the value of religious group membership as well as participation in religious events (e.g. going to church).&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010"&gt;Arweck, E. &amp; Nesbitt, E. (2010). Young people's identity formation in mixed-faith families: continuity or discontinuity of religious traditions? Journal of Contemporary Religion, 25, 67-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KingWhitbeck1997"&gt;King, V. Elder, G.H., Whitbeck, L.B. (1997). Religious involvement among rural youth: An ecological and life-course perspective. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 7, 431-456.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious identity, on the other hand, refers specifically to religious group membership regardless of religious activity or participation. 

Similar to other forms of identity formation, such as ethnic and [[cultural identity]], the religious context can generally provide a perspective from which to view the world, opportunities to socialize with a spectrum of individuals from different generations, and a set of basic principles to live out.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004"&gt;King, P.E. &amp; Boyatzis, C.J. (2004). Exploring adolescent spiritual and religious development: current and future theoretical and empirical perspectives. Applied Developmental Science, 8, 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; These foundations can come to shape an individual's identity.

Despite the implications that religion has on identity development, the identity formation literature has mainly focused on ethnicity and gender and has largely discounted the role of religion. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have begun to include religion as a factor of interest.&lt;ref name="ArweckNesbitt2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee2002"&gt;Lee, J.J. (2002). Religion and college attendance: Change among students. The Review of Higher Education, 25, 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these studies use religious identity, religiosity, and religiousness interchangeably or solely focus on religious identity and solely religious participation as separate constructs.

Of these types of research studies, researchers have examined the various factors that affect the strength of one's religious identity over time.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000"&gt;Arnett, J.J. (2000).

'Identity' is one of the most used terms in the social sciences and has different senses in different research paradigms. In addition to psychological studies, sociologists and anthropologists also apply the term 'religious identity' and examine its related processes in given social contexts. For example, one important study conducted in the United States after the events of September 11 2001, explored the meaning-making among American Muslims&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peek|first=Lori|date=2005|title=Becoming Muslim: The Development of a Religious Identity|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/66/3/215/1665611|journal=Sociology of Religion|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=215|doi=10.2307/4153097|issn=1069-4404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how changes in identity ascription (what people think about another group of people) affected how Muslims sought to represent themselves. Other studies have applied concepts appropriated from race and gender identity theory such as disidentification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin-Stożek|first=Daniel|last2=Schirr|first2=Bertram J.|date=2017-09-03|title=Identification and disidentification in reported schooling experiences of adolescent Muslims in England|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=43|issue=5|pages=580–595|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1352353|issn=0305-4985}}&lt;/ref&gt; which undermines essentialist accounts of religious identity - that an individual has a 'fixed' religious identity, independent of pre-existing systems of representation and individuals' positioning within them.  

== History ==
During the early 1800s in the field of psychology, research on the topic of religion was considered important and ubiquitous. For example, researchers like [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[William James]] conducted studies on such topics as religious conversion.&lt;ref name="Hall1904"&gt;Hall, G. S. (1904). Adolescence, Vol. II.

Journal Adolescence, 22, 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the public perspective on religion began to shift two decades later.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt; Instead of religion being seen as an integral part of an individual's life and development and thus a necessary topic to research, scientists and scholars alike viewed religion as a hindrance to the progression of science and as a topic no longer applicable to the current times.&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SiegelWhite1982"&gt;Siegel, A.W., &amp; White, S.H. (1982). The child study movement. In Advances in Child Development and Behavior. Reese, H. W. (Ed.). New York: Academic press, pp. 233-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson1928"&gt;Watson, J.B. (1928). Psychological Care of Infant and Child. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to social scientists' prediction of the general decline of religion over time and increase of secularization leading to a complete abandonment of religious studies, religion did not diminish and was instead acknowledged by researchers as a topic worthwhile to research. Scientists and scholars, like British sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]], realized that despite the neglect of religion in studies, the presence and impact of religion on individuals' lives were undeniable and did not disappear with time.&lt;ref name="Thompson1995"&gt;Thompson, J.B. (1995). The Media and Modernity: a social theory of the media. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a body of research on religion began to take root. Particularly, a handful of researchers were interested in examining religious identity during adolescence.

== Factors that affect religious identity ==
Given that religious traditions can be intricately interlaced with various aspects of culture, the religious identity literature has consistently yielded ethnic, gender, and generational differences.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;Lopez, A.B., Huynh, V.W., &amp; Fuligni, A.J. (In press). A longitudinal study of religious identity and participation during adolescence.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic Differences ===
According to [[Social Identity Theory]], when individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds feel as if their identity is threatened, they may emphasize their other social identities as a means to maintain a positive self-concept.&lt;ref name="TajfelTurner2001"&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. (2001). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In M. A. Hogg &amp; D. Abrams (Eds.), Relations: Essential readings. Key readings in social psychology (pp. 94-109). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is supported by the various studies that have shown higher levels of religious identity among ethnic minorities, particularly those from Latino and African American backgrounds, compared to European Americans.&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

=== Gender Differences ===
Gender may also impact one's religious identity. Generally, females are more likely than males to attend religious services and express that religion is an important aspect of their lives.&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Studies have captured this gender difference through observations of females reporting greater religious attitudes.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; This was also shown in a four-year longitudinal study on religious involvement for adolescents living in rural settings. Females tended to be more involved in church-related activities than males and were more likely to view themselves as religious individuals.

=== Immigrant Generational Differences ===
There are three categories of generational status: First, Second, and Third. An individual who is considered to be first generation is one who was born outside of the United States and immigrated. Second generation refers to an individual who was born in the United States but whose parent(s) were foreign-born and immigrated. Lastly, third generation refers to an individual and the individual's parents were born in the United States. 

First and second generation individuals may tend to have particularly higher religious identity levels in comparison to third generation immigrants.&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; In efforts to adjust to the stressful changes associated with the immigration process, finding a community of emotional, social, and financial support, an environment typically provided by a place of worship, may be highly sought after by immigrants.&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt; Studies have indeed revealed that adolescents from immigrant families (both first and second generation immigrants) reported higher levels of religious identity compared to adolescents whose parents are not immigrants (third generation).&lt;ref name="Harker2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschman2004" /&gt;

'''Institutional factors'''

Studies suggest that institutional factors impact on religious identity. For example in a study of Christians, Jews and Muslims in English secondary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|date=2014-08-08|title=Religious identity choices in English secondary schools|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/berj.3151|journal=British Educational Research Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=489–504|doi=10.1002/berj.3151|issn=0141-1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescents reported negative representations of their religious traditions in the curriculum and common stereotypes held by their peers. These negative ascriptions were perceived by participants to influence their strategies of representing themselves, including hiding their religious affiliations or attempting to pre-empt criticism or bullying by representing the traditions they identified with in an apologetic conciliatory manner.

== Religious identity trajectories ==
By and large, numerous studies have observed ethnic, gender, and generational differences in religious identity. However, there have not been as many longitudinal studies on the influence of ethnicity, gender, and generational status on individuals' development of religious identity over time. Nevertheless, of the handful of such studies, researchers have focused mainly on adolescence&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youniss1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="King2003"&gt;King, P.E. (2003). Religion and identity: The role of ideological, social, and spiritual contexts. Applied Developmental Science, 7, 197-204.&lt;/ref&gt; and started to branch out to emerging adulthood.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J. (2005). The role of religion in the transition to adulthood for young emerging adults. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 4, 245-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010"&gt;Barry, C.M., &amp; Nelson, L.J., Davarya, S., &amp; Urry, S. (2010). Religiosity and spirituality during the transition to adulthood. International Journal of Behavioral Development, 34, 311-324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007"&gt;Uecker, J.E., Regnerus, M., &amp; Vaaler, M.L. (2007). Losing my religion: The social sources of religious decline in early adulthood. Social Forces, 85, 1667-1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Researchers have been particularly interested in studying identity during adolescence because it is a developmental period crucial to identity development. During this period, adolescents have opportunities to explore their ethnic, cultural, and religious traditions.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt; However, the freedom and flexibility of their exploration is typically within the constraints of their parents or caregiver.

It was believed that religious identity and participation would both follow the same trajectory and decrease across time; hence, the studies that examined religiousness, which combines the two constructs.&lt;ref name="KingBoyatzis2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough2003" /&gt; Although religious affiliation, identity, and participation are closely related, longitudinal research on adolescents suggests that these constructs have different trajectories from one another. For example, researchers have found that religious affiliation and identity for adolescents remained fairly stable across the high school years, which contradicts the expected change in religious affiliation from affiliated to unaffiliated and decrease in religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

However, the stability of adolescent religious identity parallels that of other social identities such as ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Fuligni2008"&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., &amp; Baldelomar, O. (2008). Stability and change in ethnic labeling among adolescents from Asian and Latin American immigrant families. Child Development, 79(4), 944-956.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reasoned that due to adolescents' relatively stable social environment, there is not a strong need to further explore and renegotiate their religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Moreover, religious identity is mainly driven by parents during adolescence.&lt;ref name="Denham2004"&gt;Denham, S.A. et al. (2004) Paper presented at the biennial Conference on Human Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that adolescents tend to still live with their parents during high school, there may not be a need to engage in deeper exploration of their religion, which may help explain the observed stable religious identity. 

Whereas religious affiliation and identity remain stable, religious participation tends to decrease.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; Adolescents may exercise their increased autonomy and choose not to attend religious events. Particularly, adolescents may find other activities (e.g. studying, clubs, and sports) vying for their time and resources and choose to prioritize those activities over religious events. The significant decline in religious participation at the end of high school may be a precursor to further decline during emerging adulthood.

=== Emerging Adulthood ===
Adolescence has been traditionally associated with a time of identity exploration. However, that exploration process is not complete by the end of adolescence. Rather, emerging adulthood, the years between late teens and late twenties, extends the identity formation process from adolescence.&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Valde1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitbourneTesch1985" /&gt; 

This transitional period is marked by constant changes in romantic love, work, and worldviews&lt;ref name="Arnett2000" /&gt; and is generally a time of "semiautonomy."&lt;ref name="Goldscheider1994"&gt;Goldscheider, F., &amp; Goldscheider, C. (1994). Leaving and returning home in 20th century America. Population Bulletin, 48(4), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldscheiderDaVanzo1986"&gt;Goldscheider, F., DaVanzo, J. (1986). Semiautonomy and leaving home in early adulthood. Social Forces, 65, 187-201.&lt;/ref&gt; With this increased sense of autonomy, emerging adults may choose to further exert their independence by moving away from home and/or by attending college. Through whichever ways that emerging adults choose to exercise their autonomy, they are likely to find themselves in new, diverse environments teeming with a spectrum of vast worldviews.

Despite the necessity for studies on religious identity, there has been limited work on the role of religion in identity formation in emerging adults. Compared to the research in adolescence, there is much less work on the development of religious identity and religious participation across the emerging adulthood years. The combination of immense and frequent changes, increased autonomy, and diverse environments during this period has major ramifications for the development of emerging adults' religious affiliation, religious identity, and religious participation. 

Religion was believed to have little impact on emerging adults' identity, particularly for those who attend college&lt;ref name="BrinkerhoffMarlene1993"&gt;Brinkerhoff, M.B., &amp; Marlene, M.M. (1993). Casting Off the Bonds of Organized Religion: A Religious-Careers Approach to the Study of Apostasy. Review of Religious Research 34:235-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HunsbergerBrown1984"&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; L.B., Brown. (1984). Religious socialization, apostasy, and the impact of family background. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 23, 239-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PewForum"&gt;Pew Forum, o. R. a. P. L. (2008). U.S. Religious Landscape Survey (Report).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WillitsCrider1989"&gt;Willits, F.K. &amp; Crider, D.M. (1989). Church Attendance and Traditional Religious Beliefs in Adolescence and Young Adulthood: A Panel Study. Review of Religious Research, 31, 68-81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent research suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; According to a study, while 14 percent of college students reported a decrease in religious beliefs throughout college, 48 percent reported stable religious beliefs, and 38 percent reported an increase.&lt;ref name="Lee2002" /&gt;

Moreover, another study found that contrary to the expectations of decreased religious identity and religious participation during emerging adulthood, religious identity did not decrease, but religious participation did decline as predicted.&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt; Researchers explained that emerging adults are more likely to decrease their involvement in religious activities than they are to completely disaffiliate from their religion or express less importance of religion in their lives.

Additionally, in a study that examined the ways in which religion influenced emerging adults, researchers found that emerging adults' standards of adulthood were dependent upon the religious affiliation of the institution they attended.&lt;ref name="BarryNelson2005" /&gt; For example, compared to emerging adults who attended Catholic or public universities, emerging adults who attended Mormon universities rated interdependence, norm compliance, biological transitions, and family capacities as extremely important criteria for adulthood. 

In summary, although not all studies on this topic are in agreement, religious identity generally tends to remain stable during emerging adulthood whereas religious participation decreases over time.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uecker2007" /&gt;

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

'''Religious persecution''' is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group of individuals as a response to their [[Religion|religious beliefs or affiliations]] or lack thereof.

The tendency of societies or groups within society to alienate or repress different subcultures is a recurrent theme in human history. Moreover, because a person's religion often determines to a significant extent his or her morality, worldview, [[self-image]], attitudes towards others, and overall personal identity, religious differences can be significant cultural, personal, and social factors.

Religious persecution may be triggered by religious bigotry (i.e. members of a dominant group denigrating religions other than their own) or by the state when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security. At a societal level, this [[dehumanisation]] of a particular religious group may readily turn into violence or other forms of persecution. Indeed, in many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a [[human rights]] problem.

==Definition==
Religious persecution is defined as violence or discrimination against religious minorities, actions intending to deprive political rights and force minorities to assimilate, leave, or live as [[second-class citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David T. Smith|title=Religious Persecution and Political Order in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9nECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|date=12 November 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-11731-0|pages=26–|quote="Persecution" in this study refers to violence or discrimination against members of a religious minority because of their religious affiliation. Persecution involves the most damaging expressions of prejudice against an out-group, going beyond verbal abuse and social avoidance.29 It refers to actions that are intended to deprive individuals of their political rights and to force minorities to assimilate, leave, or live as second-class citizens. When these actions happen persistently over a period of time, and include large numbers of both perpetrators and victims, we may refer to a "campaign" of persecution that usually has the goal of excluding the targeted minority from the polity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aspect of state policy, it may be defined as violations on [[freedom of thought]], [[conscience]] and belief spread by systematic and active state policy and actions of harassment, intimidation and punishment that infringes or threatens the [[right to life]], [[integrity]] or [[liberty]].&lt;ref name="Ghanea-Hercock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nazila Ghanea-Hercock|title=The Challenge of Religious Discrimination at the Dawn of the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU3vCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-017-5968-7|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction with [[religious intolerance]] is that the latter in most cases is in the sentiment of the population, which may be tolerated or encouraged by the state.&lt;ref name="Ghanea-Hercock2013"/&gt; Denial of civil rights on the basis of religion is most often described as [[religious discrimination]], rather than religious persecution.

Examples of persecution is confiscation or destruction of property, incitement to hate, arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, murder, and execution. Religious persecution can be considered the opposite of [[freedom of religion]].

Bateman has differentiated different degrees of persecution.  "It must be personally costly... It must be unjust and undeserved... it must be a direct result of one's faith."&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, J. Keith. 2013. Don't call it persecution when it's not. ''Evangelical Missions Quarterly'' 49.1: 54-56, also p. 57-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleansing===
{{distinguish|Ritual cleansing}}
'''Religious cleansing''' is a term sometimes used to refer to removal of a population from a certain territory based on its religion.&lt;ref name=booth&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4MsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|title=The Kosovo Tragedy: The Human Rights Dimensions|author=Ken Booth|pages=50-51|publisher=Routledge|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], population cleansing was largely motivated by economic and political factors, although ethnic factors occasionally played a role.&lt;ref name=booth/&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], population cleansing took on a largely religious character.&lt;ref name=booth/&gt;  The religious motivation lost much of its salience early in the modern era, although until the 18th century ethnic enmity in Europe remained couched in religious terms.&lt;ref name=booth/&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] has argued that the references to ''[[ethnic cleansing]]'' in the former [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Iraq]] is a [[euphemism]] for what should more accurately be called religious cleansing.&lt;ref name=koopman&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199656431.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199656431-e-8|page=256|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming|author=Adrian Koopman|editor=Crole Hough|title=Ethnonyms|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adrian Koopman, the widespread use of the term ''ethnic cleansing'' in such cases suggests that in many situations there is confusion between ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref name=koopman/&gt;

===Ethnicity===
 [[File:Juif.JPG|thumb|During Nazi rule, Jews were forced to wear [[Yellow badge|yellow stars]] identifying them as such. Jews are an ethno-religious group and Nazi persecution was based on their race]]
Other acts of violence, such as [[war]], [[torture]], and [[ethnic cleansing]] not aimed at religion in particular, may nevertheless take on the qualities of religious persecution when one or more of the parties involved are characterized by religious homogeneity; an example being when conflicting populations that belong to different [[ethnic groups]] often also belong to different religions or denominations. The difference between religious and ethnic identity might sometimes be obscure (see [[Ethnoreligious]]); cases of [[genocide]] in the 20th century cannot be explained in full by citing religious differences. Still, cases such as the [[Greek genocide]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Assyrian Genocide]] are sometimes seen as religious persecution and blur the lines between ethnic and religious violence.

Since the Early modern period, there were increased [[religious cleansing]] entwined with ethnic elements.&lt;ref name="Mann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;pg=PR53|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53854-1|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As religion is an important or central marker in ethnic identity, some conflicts can be described as "ethno-religious conflicts".&lt;ref name="BercovitchKremenyuk2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacob Bercovitch|author2=Victor Kremenyuk|author3=I William Zartman|title=The SAGE Handbook of Conflict Resolution|chapter=Characteristics of ethno-religious conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cqjpHmhTZsC&amp;pg=PA265|date=3 December 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-0659-1|pages=265–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] provides another example of the contentious divide between ethnic and religious persecution, because [[Nazi propaganda]] tended to construct its image of Jews as race, and de-emphasized Jews as being defined by their religion. The [[Holocaust]] made no distinction between secular Jews, atheistic Jews, [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jews]] and Jews that had converted to Christianity. The Nazis also persecuted the [[Catholic Church]] in [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|Germany]] and [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|Poland]].

===Atheism===
Religious persecution may also affect [[Atheism|atheists]] in that they may be denounced as being [[amorality|amoral]] or be persecuted by the religious on the grounds that they are godless.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Cases==
The descriptive use of the term religious persecution is rather difficult. Religious persecution has taken place at least since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], and has happened in different historical, geographical and social contexts.

One period of religious persecution which has been studied extensively is [[Early modern period|early modern]] England, since the rejection of religious persecution, now common in the [[Western world]], originated there. The English 'Call for Toleration' was the turning point in the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], and early modern England stands out to the historians as a time in which literally "hundreds of books and tracts were published either for or against religious toleration."&lt;ref name="Coffey00-14"&gt;Coffey 2000: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This time has been debated thoroughly by historians, whereas, for the obvious reason of the over-abundance of material, historians generally avoid writing books on the whole of human history. reword?--&gt;

The most ambitious chronicle of that time is [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W.K.Jordan]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''The Development of Religious Toleration in England, 1558-1660'' (four volumes, published 1932-1940). Jordan wrote as the threat of [[fascism]] rose in Europe, and this work is seen as a defense of the fragile [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of [[humanism]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000, 2&lt;/ref&gt; More recent introductions to this period are ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558–1689'' (2000) by [[John Coffey (historian)|John Coffey]] and ''Charitable hatred. Tolerance and intolerance in England, 1500-1700'' (2006) by Alexandra Walsham. To understand why religious persecution has occurred, historians like Coffey "pay close attention to what the persecutors said they were doing."&lt;ref name="Coffey00-14"/&gt;

====Ecclesiastical dissent and civil tolerance====
No religion is free from internal dissent, although the degree of dissent that is tolerated within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church is described as ''ecclesiastical tolerance'',&lt;ref&gt;John Coffey (2000), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and is one form of [[religious toleration]]. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean ''civil tolerance'', which refers to the degree of religious diversity that is tolerated within the state.

In the absence of civil toleration, someone who finds himself in disagreement with his congregation doesn't have the option to leave and chose a different faith - simply because there is only one recognized faith in the country (at least officially). In modern western [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] any citizen may join and leave a religious organization at will; In western societies, this is taken for granted, but actually, this legal [[separation of Church and State]] only started to emerge a few centuries ago.

In the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]], the notion of civil tolerance allowed Christian theologians to reconcile Jesus' commandment to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemies]] with other parts of the [[New Testament]] that are rather strict regarding dissent within the church. Before that, theologians like [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]]&lt;!--or [[Thomas Thorowgood]] in protestant England--&gt; had reasoned from the ecclesiastical intolerance of the early Christian church in the New Testament to the civil intolerance of the Christian state.&lt;ref&gt;John Coffey (2000), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Religious uniformity in early modern Europe=====
{{Main|Religious uniformity}}

By contrast to the notion of civil tolerance, in [[early modern Europe]] the subjects were required to attend the [[state church]]; This attitude can be described as ''territoriality'' or ''[[religious uniformity]]'', and its underlying assumption is brought to a point by a statement of the Anglican theologian [[Richard Hooker]]: "There is not any man of the Church of England but the same man is also a member of the [English] commonwealth; nor any man a member of the commonwealth, which is not also of the Church of England."&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Richard Hooker'', II, p. 485; quoted after: John Coffey (2000), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a vigorous debate about religious persecution took place in England (starting in the 1640s), for centuries in Europe, religion had been tied to territory. In England there had been several [[Act of Uniformity|Acts of Uniformity]]; in continental Europe the Latin phrase "[[cuius regio, eius religio]]" had been coined in the 16th century and applied as a fundament for the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). It was pushed to the extreme by [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist regime]]s, particularly by the French kings [[Louis XIV]] and his successors. It was under their rule that [[Catholicism]] became the sole compulsory allowed religion in France and that the [[huguenots]] had to massively leave the country. Persecution meant that the state was committed to secure religious uniformity by coercive measures, as eminently obvious in a statement of [[Roger L'Estrange]]: "That which you call persecution, I translate Uniformity".&lt;ref&gt;quoted after Coffey (2000), 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 17th century writers like [[Pierre Bayle]], [[John Locke]], [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]] and Roger William broke the link between territory and faith, which eventually resulted in a shift from territoriality to religious voluntarism.&lt;ref name=Coffey58&gt;Coffey 2000: 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Locke who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]], defined the state in purely secular terms:&lt;ref name=Coffey57&gt;Coffey 2000: 57.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"The commonwealth seems to me to be a society of men constituted only for the procuring, preserving, and advancing their own civil interests."''&lt;ref name=Locke89&gt;John Locke (1698): [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]; [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke-t/locke_toleration.html Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the church, he went on: ''"A church, then, I take to be a voluntary society of men, joining themselves together of their own accord."''&lt;ref name=Locke89 /&gt; With this treatise, John Locke laid one of the most important intellectual foundations of the [[separation of church and state]], which ultimately led to the [[secular state]].

====Persecution for heresy and blasphemy====
{{Main|Heresy|Blasphemy}}
{{See also|Christian heresy|Heresy in Orthodox Judaism}}

The persecution of beliefs that are deemed schismatic is one thing; the persecution of beliefs that are deemed heretic or blasphemous is another. Although a public disagreement on secondary matters might be serious enough, it has often only led to [[religious discrimination]]. A public renouncement of core elements of a religious doctrine under the same circumstances, on the other hand, would have put one far greater danger. While a [[dissenter]] from its official Church was only faced with fines and imprisonment in Protestant England, six people were executed for heresy or blasphemy during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and two more in 1612 under [[James I of England|James I]].&lt;ref name="John Coffey 2000, p. 26"&gt;John Coffey (2000), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, heretical sects like Cathars, Waldensians and Lollards were brutally suppressed in western Europe, while, at the same time, Catholic Christians lived side-by-side with 'schismatic' Orthodox Christians after the [[East-West Schism]] in the borderland of eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin j. Kaplan (2007), ''Divided by Faith, Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Russian Orthodox=====

The Bishop of Vladimir Feodor turned some people into slaves, others were locked in prison, cut their heads, burnt eyes, cut tongues or crucified on walls. Some heretics were executed by burning them alive. According to an inscription of Khan Mengual-Temir, Metropolitan Kiril was granted the right to heavily punish with death for blasphemy against the Orthodox Church or breach of ecclesiastical privileges. He advised all means of destruction to be used against heretics, but without bloodshed, in the name of 'saving souls'. Heretics were drowned. Novgorod Bishop Gennady Gonzov turned to Tsar [[Ivan III]] requesting the death of heretics. Gennady admired the Spanish inquisitors, especially his contemporary [[Tomás de Torquemada|Torquemada]], who for 15 years of inquisition activity burned and punished thousands of people. As in Rome, persecuted fled to depopulated areas. The most terrible punishment was considered an underground pit, where rats lived. Some people had been imprisoned and tied to the wall there, and untied after their death.&lt;ref&gt;А.С.Пругавин, ук. соч., с.27-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Believers]] were persecuted and executed, the order was that even those renouncing completely their beliefs and baptized in the state Church to be lynched without mercy. The writer [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] opposed the religious teachings and by his initiative a scientific book against them was published. The book was destroyed, the Russian synod insisted Lomonosov's works to be burned and requested his punishment.

Амосов, "Судный день", в списание "Церковь" № 2, 1992, издателство "Церковь", Москва, с.11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Persecution for political reasons====
[[File:HooperBurning.jpg|thumb|Protestant Bishop [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] was burned at the stake by Queen [[Mary I of England]]]]
More than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death by English governments between 1535 and 1681 for treason, thus for secular rather than [[religious offense]]s.&lt;ref name="John Coffey 2000, p. 26"/&gt; In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] issued his [[papal bull]] ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically worsened the situation of the Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious [[Popish Plot]]. The 1584 [[Parliament of England]], declared in "[[An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons]]" that the purpose of [[Jesuit]] missionaries who had come to Britain was "to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility".&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Jesuit priests like [[Saint John Ogilvie]] were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the [[Elizabethan era]] as the time of [[William Shakespeare]], but compared to the antecedent [[Marian Persecutions]] there is an important difference to consider. [[Mary I of England]] had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 81.&lt;/ref&gt; had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas [[Elizabeth I of England]] "acted out of fear for the security of her realm."&lt;ref&gt;Coffey 2000: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Contemporary=====
[[Persecution of Hindus]] resulting in the death of thousands in the Anti Hindu riots in India.

[[Persecution of Ahmadis|Persecution of Ahmadi Muslims]] resulting in the [[2010 Ahmadiyya mosques massacre|Lahore Massacre]] in Pakistan. 

Although his book was written before the [[September 11 attacks]], John Coffey explicitly compares the English fear of the Popish Plot with the contemporary [[Islamophobia]] in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;"Like the extremist Islamic clerics who today provide inspiration for terrorist campaigns, the [Catholic] priests could not be treated like men who only sought the spiritual nourishment of the flock." Coffey 2000: 38&amp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Muslims imprisoned in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] there also were [[Mehdi Ghezali]] and [[Murat Kurnaz]] who could not have been found to have any connections with terrorism, but had traveled to [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] because of their religious interests.

===Early persecution of and by monotheisms===
[[File:Caravaggio-Crucifixion of Peter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Peter]], an apostle of Jesus, was executed by the Romans]]
According to Rabbinic tradition, [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Judaism]] arose in [[Egypt]] under the direction of [[Moses]]. Among the [[Ten Commandments]] of that religion was one that forbade the worship of any other god than [[Yahweh]]; this led to conflict when [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] [[Rome]] extended its reach into the [[Middle East]].

Early [[Christianity]] also came into conflict with the Roman Empire, and may have been more threatening to the established polytheistic order than had been Judaism, because of the importance of [[evangelism]] in Christianity. Under [[Nero]], the Jewish exemption from the requirement to participate in public cults was lifted and Rome began to actively persecute monotheists.  This persecution ended in 313 AD with the [[Edict of Milan]], and Christianity was made the official religion of the empire in 380 AD. By the eighth century Christianity had attained a clear ascendancy across Europe and neighboring regions, and a period of consolidation began marked by the pursuit of [[Heresy|heretics]], [[Paganism|heathens]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], and various other religious groups.

===Persecution of Hindus===
{{Main|Persecution of Hindus|Anti-Hinduism}}
The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dated 2 August 1971, stated "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html |title=World: Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=2 August 1971 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] wrote in a report that was part of [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] testimony dated 1 November 1971, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked "H". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from [[Islamabad]]". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as [[UNESCO]] and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country.The [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]] covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. "Other reminders were the yellow "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" (by "Muslim army", meaning the [[Pakistan Army]], which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), ([[Newsday]], 29 April 1994).

Hindus constitute approximately 0.5% of the total population of the United States. Hindus in the US enjoy both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' legal equality. However, a series of attacks were made on people Indian origin by a street gang called the "[[Dotbusters]]" in [[New Jersey]] in 1987, the dot signifying the Bindi dot sticker worn on the forehead by Indian women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB173FF931A25753C1A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "In Jersey City, Indians Protest Violence"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The lackadaisical attitude of the local police prompted the South Asian community to arrange small groups all across the state to fight back against the street gang.

A number of perpetrators have been brought to trial for these assaults.

Following the sentence, activists of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and its student wing [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami#Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir|Islami Chhatra Shibir]] attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country.

The violence in Delhi was triggered by the assassination of Indira Gandhi, India's prime minister, on 31 October 1984, by two of her Sikh [[bodyguard]]s in response to her actions authorising the military operation. After the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] following [[Operation Blue Star]], many [[Indian National Congress]] workers including [[Jagdish Tytler]], [[Sajjan Kumar]] and Kamal Nath were accused of inciting and participating in riots targeting the Sikh population of the capital. The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In the aftermath of the riots, the Indian government reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] reported "at least" 1,000 [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref name="Mukhoty 1984"&gt;{{Citation |title=Who are the Guilty ? | last =Mukhoty | first =Gobinda | last2 =Kothari | first2 =Rajni |url=http://www.sacw.net/aii/WhoaretheGuilty.html |year=1984 |publisher=[[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]| accessdate=4 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in [[Delhi]]. The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], the main Indian investigating agency, is of the opinion that the acts of violence were organized with the support from the then Delhi police officials and the central government headed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s son, [[Rajiv Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="IBN23April"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/1984-antisikh-riots-backed-by-govt-police-cbi/251375-37-64.html |title=1984 anti-Sikh riots backed by Govt, police: CBI |publisher=[[IBN Live]]|date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as Prime Minister after his mother's death and, when asked about the riots, said  "when a big tree falls (Mrs. Gandhi's death), the earth shakes (occurrence of riots)" thus trying to justify communal strife.&lt;ref name="HT18NOV"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/India/Article1-352523.aspx |title=1984 anti-Sikh riots 'wrong', says Rahul Gandhi |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |date=18 November 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012025532/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/India/Article1-352523.aspx |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are allegations that the [[Indian National Congress]] government at that time destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. The ''[[Asian Age]]'' front-page story called the government actions "the Mother of all Cover-ups"&lt;ref name=coverup-1&gt;{{cite news | last = Mustafa |first = Seema | title = 1984 Sikhs Massacres: Mother of All Cover-ups | work = Front page story | page = 1| publisher = The Asian Age | date = 2005-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Agal |first = Renu | title = Justice delayed, justice denied | work =| pages =| publisher = BBC News | date = 2005-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations that the violence was led and often perpetrated by Indian National Congress activists and sympathisers during the riots.&lt;ref name="Leaders"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4130962.stm | title=Leaders 'incited' anti-Sikh riots | publisher=BBC News | date=August 8, 2005 | accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government, then led by the Congress, was widely criticised for doing very little at the time, possibly acting as a conspirator. The [[conspiracy theory]] is supported by the fact that voting lists were used to identify Sikh families. Despite their communal conflict and riots record, the  [[Indian National Congress]] claims to be a secular party.

===State atheism===
{{Main|State atheism}}

State atheism has been defined by David Kowalewski as the official "promotion of [[atheism]]" by a [[government]], typically by active suppression of [[religious freedom]] and practice.&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/128810 Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences], David Kowalewski, ''Russian Review'', Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 426–441, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Editors and Board of Trustees of the Russian Review&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[misnomer]] referring to a government's [[anti-clericalism]], which opposes religious institutional power and influence, real or alleged, in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Anticlericalism'' (2007 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

State atheism was first practised during a brief period in [[Revolutionary France]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} and repeated only in [[Mexican Revolution|Revolutionary Mexico]] and [[Communist state|Communist states]].  The Soviet Union had a long history of state atheism,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greeley2003|Greeley (2003)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which social success largely required individuals to profess atheism, stay away from churches and even vandalize them; this attitude was especially militant during the middle Stalinist era from 1929-1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pospielovsky1998|Pospielovsky (1998)]]:257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miner2003|Miner (2003)]]:70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davies1996|Davies (1996)]]:962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union attempted to suppress religion over wide areas of its influence, including places like central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pipes1989|Pipes (1989)]]:55.&lt;/ref&gt; and the post-[[World War II]] [[Eastern bloc]]. One state within that bloc, the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]], went so far as to officially ban all religious practices.&lt;ref name="Elsie 2000:18"&gt;[[#Elsie2000|Elsie (2000)]]:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of Baha'is===
{{Main|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}

The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are Iran's largest religious minority, and Iran is the location of one of the largest Bahá'í populations in the world. Bahá'ís in Iran have been subject to unwarranted arrests, false imprisonment, beatings, torture, unjustified executions, confiscation and destruction of property owned by individuals and the Bahá'í community, denial of employment, denial of government benefits, denial of civil rights and liberties, and denial of access to higher education.

More recently, in the later months of 2005, an intensive anti-Bahá'í campaign was conducted by Iranian newspapers and radio stations. The state-run and influential ''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper, whose [[managing editor]] is appointed by Iran's supreme leader, [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4308203.stm], ran nearly three dozen articles defaming the Bahá'í Faith. Furthermore, a confidential letter sent on October 29, 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forced in Iran states that the Supreme Leader of Iran, [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] has instructed the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhere to the Bahá'í Faith and to monitor their activities and gather any and all information about the members of the Bahá'í Faith. The letter was brought to the attention of the international community by Asma Jahangir, the [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] on freedom of religion or belief, in a March 20, 2006 press release [http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/5E72D6B7B624AABBC125713700572D09?opendocument].

In the press release the Special Rapporteur states that she "is highly concerned by information she has received concerning the treatment of members of the Bahá'í community in Iran." She further states that "The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating."

===Persecution of Buddhists===
{{Main|Persecution of Buddhists|Persecution of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh|2012 Ramu violence|Genocide of indigenous peoples#Bangladesh|Chakma people|Jumma people|Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|Haibutsu kishaku}}
Persecution of Buddhists was a widespread phenomenon throughout the history of Buddhism lasting to this day, beginning as early as the 3rd century AD by the Zoroastrian Sassanid Empire. Anti-Buddhist sentiments in Imperial China between the 5th and 10th century led to the ''Four Buddhist Persecutions in China'' of which the ''Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution'' of 845 was probably the most severe. 
In the 20th century Buddhists were persecuted by Asian communist states and parties, Imperial Japan and by the Kuomintang among others.

===Persecution of Serers===
{{main|Serer religion|Serer history (medieval era to present)}}

Persecution of the [[Serer people]] of [[Senegal]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]] is multifaceted, and it includes both religious and ethnic elements. Religious and ethnic persecution of the Serer people dates back to the 11th century when [[War Jabi|King War Jabi]] usurped the throne of [[Tekrur]] (part of present-day Senegal) in 1030, and by 1035, introduced [[Sharia law]] and forced his subjects to submit to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew F., &amp; Phillips, Lucie Colvin, "Historical Dictionary of Senegal". ed: 2, Metuchen, New Jersey : Scrarecrow Press (1994) p 265&lt;/ref&gt; With the assistance of his son (Leb), their [[Almoravid]] allies and other [[Ethnic groups in Senegal|African ethnic groups who have embraced Islam]], the Muslim coalition army launched [[jihad]]s against the Serer people of Tekrur who refused to abandon [[Serer religion]] in favour of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Willie F., "Encyclopedia of African history and culture: African kingdoms (500 to 1500)", pp 209, 676.

From the 20th to the 21st centuries, persecution of the Serers is less obvious, nevertheless they are the object of scorn and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, M T Rosalie Akouele, "Customary Law and Slavery in West Africa", Trafford Publishing (2011), pp 481-482, {{ISBN|1-4269-7117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Mwakikagile "&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]], "Ethnic Diversity and Integration in The Gambia: The Land, The People and The Culture," (2010), p 241, {{ISBN|9987-9322-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of Falun Gong===
{{main|Persecution of Falun Gong|610 Office|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}

The persecution of the [[Falun Gong]] [[spiritual practice]] began with campaigns initiated in 1999 by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to eliminate Falun Gong in China. It is characterised by multifaceted [[propaganda]] campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, [[forced labor]], and [[physical torture]], sometimes resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b83b6e00.html |title=China: The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called "heretical organizations"|date=23 March 2000|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There have being reports of [[Organ harvesting]] of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Several researchers—most notably Canadian human rights lawyer [[David Matas]], former parliamentarian [[David Kilgour]], and investigative journalist [[Ethan Gutmann]]—estimate that tens of thousands of Falun Gong [[prisoners of conscience]] have been killed to supply a lucrative trade in human organs and cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kilgour]], [[David Matas]] (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007)  [http://organharvestinvestigation.net An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China] (free in 22 languages) organharvestinvestigation.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shugenja''''' (修験者) are practitioners of the [[Religions of Japan|Japanese]] [[religion]] of [[Shugendō]]. They are sometimes known as ''[[yamabushi]]''.

==Role-playing games==
===Bushido===
In ''[[Bushido (role-playing game)|Bushido]]'', a [[role-playing game]] published in 1981 by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]], Shugenja are portrayed as [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]].

===Legend of the Five Rings===
In the ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]'' [[collectible card game]], ''shugenja'' are [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]-users, similar to wizards. Their spells are given power by the five different varieties of [[kami]] that can be found in [[Rokugan]]. Their magic is referred to as Elemental Magic, as opposed to Bloodspeakers who use Blood Magic. In the [[Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game|role-playing game]], being a ''shugenja'' is one of the main alternatives in character creation.

===Dungeons &amp; Dragons===
The [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|shugenja]] (with the alternate spelling ''shukenja'') was introduced in the original [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|first edition]] ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' book as a subclass of cleric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], with [[David Cook (game designer)|David Cook]], and [[François Marcela-Froideval]]. ''Oriental Adventures'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; A version of this class (also called [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|shugenja]]) was incorporated into ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' in the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|third edition]]  ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' [[sourcebook]], and revised in the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] sourcebook ''[[Complete Divine]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''Strixology''' is a genre of writing about the reality and dangers of [[witch]]es, their origins, character and power; often in the context of [[theology]] or of [[demonology]].{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 205}} (The Latin word ''strix'' can mean "screech-owl" or "witch".&lt;ref&gt;
[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strix See "strix" in Wiktionary.]
&lt;/ref&gt;)

During the [[early modern period]] strixologists refuted the reality of witches and contributed to the decline of [[witch-hunts]].{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=vii}}

As a systematic study, strixology emerged during the period 1431—1439 at the [[Council of Basel]] - an ecclesiastical council where [[theologians]] and [[demonologist]]s met and debated what was seen as the [[Devil]]'s work, [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]al observations and confessions of witches.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|pp=53-54}} Those issues were not a primary purpose of the Council. Nonetheless, the subject of one of the discussions was a peasant named [[Stedelen]] who was believed to have committed ''[[maleficia]]''{{efn|harmful acts of witchcraft}} and who said under torture that he was a part of a secret society of Devil-worshippers. This story was disturbing enough to be reported to the council by Peter of Simmental and described in great detail.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=54}}

This case and similar revelations were later used by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] professor [[Johannes Nider]], a participant at the Council's meetings, as examples in his ''[[Formicarius]]'' (1436-1438) a book that laid the foundations of strixology. Scholars cited this significant work for centuries.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|pp=54-55}} Around the time ''Formicarius'' was published, there was a relatively small number of witch-hunt victims - estimated to have been in the hundreds.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=56}} This changed at the end of the 15th century, partially due to the publication of the infamous ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' which cemented belief in the reality of witches{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 56}} and in the higher susceptibility of women to take part in witchcraft.{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p= 57}} The book proclaimed that “evils which are performed by witches exceed all other sin which God has ever permitted to be done.…”.{{sfnb|Summers|1971|loc=[Part

'''''Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion''''' (1st imp. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[New Jersey]] 1952, [[Princeton University Press]], 169 pp) is a philosophy book written by [[Walter Terence Stace]]. At the time of writing, Stace was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he had worked since 1932 after a 22-year career in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. ''Time and Eternity'' was one of his first books about the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[mysticism]], after writing throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s that was influenced by [[Phenomenalism|phenomenalist]] philosophy.

In his introduction Stace writes that ''Time and Eternity'' is an attempt to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He explains that the basic idea set out in the book is that all religious thought is symbolic, and that his influences include [[Rudolf Otto]], especially his ''Mysticism East and West'', and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He says he was motivated to write the book in an attempt to add to the "other half of the truth which I now think naturalism [as espoused in his 1947 essay ''Man Against Darkness''] misses".

The book begins by looking at religion, specifically God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He goes on to say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter asks what religion is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, is rooted in [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]], and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the [[Apophatic theology|negative divine]] - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, it is only the theories about it that differ.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1952) ''Time and Eternity''.  [[Princeton University Press]]. P. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is not that the mystic has an experience, even a direct vision, of God. For in that case God would be the object for the soul as subject. The distinction between God and the soul, as object and subject respectively, is wholly done away with. The soul passes into the being of God, becomes God, is God."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Stace then goes on to explain that all religions say that religious revelation is [[ineffability|ineffable]], because no words or concepts can be applied to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace then looks at the [[Cataphatic theology|positive divine]]; he asks how concepts can be applied to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).

[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|200px|"Thus when Plotinus speaks of "the flight of the alone to the Alone,"… [this] evoke[s] in us a measure of the same experience which the author of them had."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Next Stace explains that there are two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and the [[noumenon]], although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at symbolism in religion, Stace states that there are two types of predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a [[hierarchy of being]], and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the [[numinous|numen]] and qualities found in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace next looks at religion’s claims to truth. He draws an analogy between mystical illumination and aesthetic truth, as the truths of both rest on revelation rather than reason. "Either you directly perceive beauty, or you do not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, or you do not."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he maintains the arguments of both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "What is the meaning of the metaphor of intersection? This intersection means precisely what the eternal moment is experienced to be. It is one and the same human consciousness which experiences both the temporal or natural world and that eternal and infinite order which is disclosed in mystical illumination."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These separate spheres lead Stace to reflect on both [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|proofs for God]] and [[acosmism]]. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, is a direct result of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "The pure religious consciousness lies in a region which is forever beyond all proof or disproof. This is a necessary consequence of the "utterly other" character of God from the world, and of the "utterly other" character of the world from God. The eternal order is not the natural order, and the natural order is not the eternal order. The two orders intersect, but in the intersection each remains what it is. Each is wholly self-contained. Therefore, it is impossible to pass, by any logical inference, from one to the other. This at once precludes as impossible any talk either of the proof or disproof of religion."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In the final chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns to the idea that theology and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of [[Vedanta]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]]) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.

[[File:Ikone Athanasius von Alexandria.jpg|thumb|200px|“[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|The Upanishad]] says flatly that Brahman "is incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended". [[Creed of St. Athanasius|The creed of St. Athanasius]] agrees with the Upanishad: 
'The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, 
the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. . . . 
Yet not three incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Critical response==

[[Virgil Aldrich|Virgil C Aldrich]] reviewed the book alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind'' and ''The Gate of Silence'', also by Stace and published in 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a [[David Hume|Hume]] or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it is difficult to determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil Aldrich|Aldrich, Virgil C.]] (Jan. 21, 1954). "Book Reviews", ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', 51(2), 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Seelye Bixler|Julius Seelye Bixler]] reviewed the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review he wrote that he believed Stace was trying to have his cake and eat it with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Oct., 1952). "Book Reviews", ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion|The Journal of Bible and Religion]]'', 20(4), 272-274, OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he reviewed ''Time and Eternity'' alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind''. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Jul 1953). "Reviews of Books", ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 62(3), 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace was praised for his clarity and ambitious aims in ''Time and Eternity'' by [[Abraham Kaplan]] who believed the book was one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of [[Samuel Alexander]]. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kaplan|Kaplan, Abraham]] (Oct 1953). "Book Reviews", ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', 3(3), 1953, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noting the unachievable ambition of solving the conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were to approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|''Tractatus'']]: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Martin A. (Mar. 1953). "Reviews", ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'',13(3), 416-417.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy M. Emmet]] found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmet, Dorothy, M.]] (Jan 1954). "New Books", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', 29(108), 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Maurice Friedman writes about the book in the context of the various attempts to find a universal essence - or [[perennial philosophy]] - within religion. He finds that ''Time and Eternity'' is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by [[Aldous Huxley]] or [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Maurice. (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hnWXeuZN2MoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 A Heart of Wisdom: Religion and Human Wholeness]'' [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 98-100. {{ISBN|9781438403366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received more positive support however. [[Robert Cummings Neville|Robert C Neville]] called ''Time and Eternity'' “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and time in our century so far”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cummings Neville|Neville, Robert Cummings]]. (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUYCRhDooAC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236 Eternity and Time's Flow]'', [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|9780791415993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Thought: [[A Very Short Introduction]]'', Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne, Tim. (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIo9QLwjh4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 Thought: A Very Short Introduction]'' Oxford University Press. p. 121. {{ISBN|9780199601721}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Arthur Goldwag has said that the phrase "that than which there is no other" that he encountered in ''Time and Eternity'' was one of a number of factors that contributed to him giving up praying.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwag, Arthur (October 9, 2009) [http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/ ''Confession: Why I Don't Pray'']. Killing the Buddha magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16572">A '''tobacco fatwa''' is a [[fatwa]] ([[Islam]]ic legal pronouncement) that prohibits the usage of [[tobacco]] by [[Muslim]]s. All contemporary rulings condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit ([[haraam|haram]]) smoking outright as a result of the [[Health effects of tobacco|severe health damage]] that it causes. [[Arab Muslims]] tend to prohibit smoking (despite [[Saudi Arabia]] ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbedu.com/2009/10/09/saudi-arabia-don%E2%80%99t-keep-us-from-smoking/|title=Saudi Arabia:  Don’t Keep Us From Smoking|work=American Bedu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghouri|first1=N|last2=Atcha|first2=M|last3=Sheikh|first3=A|title=Influence of Islam on smoking among Muslims.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=4 February 2006|volume=332|issue=7536|pages=291-4|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7536.291|pmid=16455732|pmc=1360407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many Muslims, the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years, and numerous fatawas, including from notable authorities such as [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, now consider smoking ''[[haram]]'' (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include [[Islamic law]]'s general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Quran says, "And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with [[secondhand smoke]] has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.&lt;ref name="Ghouri et al. 2006"/&gt;

Fatwas condemning smoking have been issued in [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[UAE]], among others.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Byron /&gt;  

==History==
The earliest fatwa regarding smoking was issued in Morocco in 1602. Following the introduction of tobacco to the kingdom in 1598, King [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] sought guidance from religious scholars in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The kingdom's Grand Mufti and the Wali of Sila both ruled that smoking was forbidden in Islam. This ruling failed to have much effect on tobacco use in the kingdom, leading the Mufti to issue a second ruling forbidding its use, as the use of all "intoxicants and harmful substances" is forbidden in Islam. This categorical prohibition was unsuccessful, and the Mufti and the other scholars who joined him in his ruling were either killed by a mob angry at this ruling or fled the country.{{r|WHO|pp=13-15}}

In recent years, [[tobacco fatwa]]s (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.

The holy book of [[Islam]], the [[Qur'ān]], does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:

* “Don't throw yourself into danger by your own hands...” (el-Bakara 2/195)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|2|195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “You may eat, drink, but not waste” (el-A‘râf 7/31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|7|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you" (en-Nisaa' 4/29)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Quran|4|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, [[Pakistan]]) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hameed|first1=A|last2=Jalil|first2=MA|last3=Noreen|first3=R|last4=Mughal|first4=I|last5=Rauf|first5=S|title=Role of Islam in prevention of smoking.|journal=Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad|date=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=23-5|pmid=12043328|url=http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/14-1/Hameed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Islam|first1=SM|last2=Johnson|first2=CA|title=Correlates of smoking behavior among Muslim Arab-American adolescents.|journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health|date=November 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=319-37|doi=10.1080/13557850310001631722|pmid=14660124|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714038251~db=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking [[fatwa]] did not reduce smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radwan |first1=GN |last2=Israel |first2=E |last3=El-Setouhy |first3=M |last4=Abdel-Aziz |first4=F |last5=Mikhail |first5=N |last6=Mohamed |first6=MK |title=Impact of religious rulings (Fatwa) on smoking. |journal=Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology |date=December 2003 |volume=33 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=1087-101 |pmid=15119472 |url=http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012204303/http://www.nosmokingegypt.com/FATWA.pdf |archivedate=2004-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

The prominent scholar [[Yusuf al Qaradawi]] argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Second: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the [[Friday Prayer]], the Fasting of [[Ramadan]], the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192447/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503548726 |title=Is the Ruling on Smoking Still Controversial? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar |archivedate=13 February 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Indonesia==
In 2009, [[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]], the organization of Indonesian religious scholars, declared smoking in public or near pregnant women ''haram'' (forbidden), while declaring smoking in general to be ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged or reprehensible).&lt;ref name=Byron&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008111| issn = 2044-6055| volume = 5| issue = 12| pages = –008111| last1 = Byron| first1 = M.

The [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Sheikh, has ruled that "smoking is impermissible on the basis of authentic quotations, sound judgments, and the opinions of reputable physicians."{{r|WHO|pg=97}} The Mufti cites a sahih [[hadith]] (verifiable saying of the Prophet) saying "do not harm yourself or others." He further referenced a Quranic verse saying that the Prophet "forbids that which is unwholesome." 

==The UAE==
In addition to issuing a fatwa against smoking, the United Arab Emirates instructed imams in all mosques to read a sermon against smoking on June 11, 1999 following [[Friday prayers]].{{r|WHO|pg=105}}

==Tobacco industry pushback==
From the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in [[Muslim majority countries]] by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a {{"'}}fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to [[Shariah|sharia law]]", and be "a threat to existing government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boseley |first1=Sarah |title=How tobacco firms tried to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/20/tobacco-firms-tried-undermine-muslim-countries-smoking-ban|accessdate=5 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=How tobacco firms try to undermine Muslim countries' smoking ban|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/21/84683.php|accessdate=5 February 2017|publisher=[[The Bangladesh Observer]]|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]] was also concerned that the [[World Health Organization]]'s encouraging of anti-smoking stance of [[Ulama|Muslim scholars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: "This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ...

[[File:Wheel of the Year.svg|thumb|333px|The '''Wheel of the Year''' in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Pagans in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] advance these dates six months to coincide with their own seasons.]]
The '''Wheel of the Year''' is an annual cycle of [[seasonal]] [[Festival|festivals]], observed by many [[Modern paganism|modern Pagans]]. It consists of either four or eight festivals: either the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, known as the "quarter days", or the four midpoints between, known as the "cross quarter days"; [[Syncretism#Religious_syncretism|syncretic]] traditions like [[Wicca]] often celebrate all eight festivals.

The festivals celebrated by differing sects of modern Paganism can vary considerably in name and date. Observing the cycle of the seasons has been important to many people, both ancient and modern, and many contemporary Pagan festivals are based to varying degrees on [[folk tradition]]s.&lt;ref name="harvey_rpe"&gt;{{cite journal

|volume=9
|issue=3
|pages=38–41
|doi=10.1080/13537909408580720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Wiccans]], the festivals are also referred to as ''sabbats'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|b|ə|t}}, with [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] claiming this term was passed down from the [[Middle Ages]], when the terminology for [[Jewish]] [[Shabbat]] was commingled with that of other ''[[heretical]]'' celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Witchcraft Today|first=Gerald|last=Gardner|page=147|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{see also|Sun cross}}
The contemporary, eightfold, Wheel of the Year is a modern innovation. Many historical pagan and polytheist traditions celebrated various [[equinox]]es, [[solstice]]s, and the days approximately midway between them (sometimes termed "cross-quarter days") for their seasonal and agricultural significance. Generally, European cultural communities observed four main celebrations a year, sometimes with smaller, more local festivals as well. But none were known to have held ''all eight'' as seen in the modern, culturally syncretic "wheel" that is popular in [[Modern Paganism]].

Mid-20th century British Paganism had a strong influence on early adoption of an eightfold Wheel. By the late 1950s, the [[Wicca]]n [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]] had both adopted eightfold ritual calendars, in order to hold more frequent celebrations. This also had the benefit of more closely aligning celebrations between the two Pagan orders.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{citation|last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Oxford, Blackwell |isbn=0-631-18946-7 |pages=337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamond_fyw-p16"&gt;{{citation|last=Lamond |first=Frederic |title=Fifty Years of Wicca |year=2004 |location=Sutton Mallet, England |publisher=Green Magic |isbn=0-9547230-1-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to early Wicca's influence on Modern Paganism and the [[syncretic]] adoption of [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] motifs, the most commonly used English festival names for the Wheel of the Year tend to be [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], even when the celebrations were not based on those cultures.

The [[American Ásatrú]] movement has adopted, over time, a calendar in which the Heathen major holidays figure alongside many ''Days of Remembrance'' which celebrate heroes of the [[Edda]] and the [[Saga]]s, figures of Germanic history, and the [[Viking]] [[Leif Ericson]], who explored and settled [[Vinland]] (North America). These festivals are not, however, as evenly distributed throughout the year as in Wicca and other Heathen denominations.

==Festivals==
[[File:Eight-spoked wheel.svg|thumb|right|The eight-armed [[sun cross]] is often used to represent the Neopagan Wheel of the Year.]]
In many traditions of [[Modern paganism|modern Pagan]] [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], all things are considered to be cyclical, with time as a perpetual cycle of growth and retreat tied to the [[Sun]]'s annual [[Death-rebirth deity|death and rebirth]]. This cycle is also viewed as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|micro- and macrocosm]] of other life cycles in an immeasurable [[Recursion|series]] of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four [[season]]s. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals are the most common times for community celebrations.&lt;ref name="harvey_rpe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zell (2006):the Wheel"&gt;{{citation

While the "major" festivals are usually the quarter and cross-quarter days, other festivals are also celebrated throughout the year, especially among the non-[[Wiccan]] traditions such as those of [[polytheistic reconstructionism]] and other [[Ethnic religion|ethnic]] traditions.

In Wiccan and Wicca-influenced traditions, the festivals, being tied to solar movements, have generally been steeped in solar [[mythology]] and [[symbol]]ism, centered on the life cycles of the [[sun]]. Similarly, the Wiccan [[esbats]] are traditionally tied to the [[lunar cycle]]s. Together, they represent the most common celebrations in Wiccan-influenced forms of Neopaganism, especially in contemporary [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|Witchcraft]] groups.&lt;ref name="Zell (2006):the Wheel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DruryModernMagicalRevival /&gt;

In Germanic traditions, this liminal festival marks the last month of the old year and the first month of the new year and is followed by eleven days of extended celebration.&lt;ref name="Krasskova 2005:Yule"/&gt; In Roman traditions additional festivities take place during the six days leading up to Midwinter.&lt;ref name="OEAGR"/&gt;

===Imbolc===
{{main|Imbolc|Dísablót}}
As the first cross-quarter day following Midwinter this day falls on the first of February and traditionally marks the first stirrings of [[Spring (season)|spring]]. It aligns with the contemporary observance of Groundhog Day. It is time for purification and [[spring cleaning]] in anticipation of the year's new life. In Rome, it was historically a shepherd's holiday,&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;{{cite book

Derived from a reconstruction produced by linguist [[Jacob Grimm]] of an Old High German form of the Old English goddess name ''[[Ēostre]]'', Ostara marks the [[March equinox|vernal equinox]] in some modern Pagan traditions.

===Beltane===
{{main|Beltane|Floralia|Walpurgis Night}}
Traditionally the first day of summer in [[Ireland]], in Rome the earliest celebrations appeared in pre-Christian times with the festival of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the Roman goddess of flowers, and the Walpurgisnacht celebrations of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] countries.&lt;ref name="Zell (2006):Beltane"&gt;{{citation

Since the [[Christianisation]] of Europe, a more secular version of the festival has continued in Europe and America, commonly referred to as May Day. In this form, it is well known for [[maypole]] dancing and the crowning of the [[Queen of the May]].

===Midsummer (Litha)===
{{Main|Midsummer|Summer solstice}}
Midsummer is one of the four solar holidays, and is considered the turning point at which summer reaches its height and the sun shines longest. Among the Wiccan sabbats, Midsummer is preceded by [[Beltane]], and followed by [[Lammas]] or [[Lughnasadh]].

Some Wiccan traditions call the festival ''Litha'', a name occurring in [[Bede]]'s ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' (''{{lang|la|De Temporum Ratione}}'', 8th century), which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the twelve months. ''{{lang|ang|Ærra Liða}}'' (''first'' or ''preceding'' ''{{lang|ang|Liða}}'') roughly corresponds to June in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and ''{{lang|ang|Æfterra Liða}}'' (''following'' ''{{lang|ang|Liða}}'') to July. Bede writes that "Litha means ''gentle'' or ''navigable'', because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beda|first1=Venerabilis|title=Bede, the reckoning of time|date=1999|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|isbn=9781846312663|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lammas/Lughnasadh===
{{main|Lammas|Lughnasadh}}
Lammas or Lughnasadh ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|n|æ|s|ə}}) is the first of the three Wiccan [[harvest]] festivals, the other two being the [[autumnal equinox]] (or Mabon) and [[Samhain]]. Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the god in bread and eating it, to symbolise the sanctity and importance of the harvest. Celebrations vary, as not all Pagans are Wiccans. The [[Irish language|Irish]] name [[Lughnasadh]]&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SpiralDance lammas"&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row {{ISBN|0-06-250814-8}} pp.191-2 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt; is used in some traditions to designate this holiday. Wiccan celebrations of this holiday are neither generally based on Celtic culture nor centered on the Celtic deity [[Lugh]]. This name seems to have been a late adoption among Wiccans. In early versions of Wiccan literature the festival is referred to as ''August Eve''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gbos/gbos10.htm|title=Gardnerian Book of Shadows: The Sabbat Rituals: August Eve|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Lammas'' (contraction of ''loaf mass'') implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread, which symbolises the first fruits of the harvest. Christian festivals may incorporate elements from the Pagan Ritual.&lt;ref name="SpiralDance lammas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lammas (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Lammas&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=etymonline.com|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autumnal equinox (Mabon)===
{{Main|September equinox}}
The holiday of the autumnal equinox, ''Harvest Home'', ''Mabon'', the ''Feast of the Ingathering'', ''{{lang|ga|Meán Fómhair}}'' or ''{{lang|cy|Alban Elfed}}'' (in [[Neo-Druid]] traditions), is a modern Pagan ritual of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the God during the coming winter months. The name ''Mabon'' was coined by [[Aidan Kelly]] around 1970 as a reference to {{lang|cy|[[Mabon ap Modron]]}}, a character from Welsh mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zell-Ravenheart|first1=Oberon Zell-Ravenheart &amp; Morning Glory|title=Creating circles &amp; ceremonies : rituals for all seasons &amp; reasons|date=2006|publisher=New Page Books|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ|isbn=1564148645|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the sabbats, it is the second of the three Pagan harvest festivals, preceded by [[Lammas]] / [[Lughnasadh]] and followed by [[Samhain]].

===Samhain===
[[File:Candelabra and Grave Dirt (58205188).jpg|thumb|200px|Neopagans honoring the dead as part of a Samhain ritual]]
{{Main|Samhain}}

Samhain ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|w|ɪ|n}}) is considered by Wiccans to be one of the four ''Greater Sabbats''. Samhain is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. Aligned with the contemporary observance of Halloween and Day of the Dead. In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the festival of [[Beltane]], which is celebrated as a festival of light and fertility.&lt;ref name="SpiralDance samhain"&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row {{ISBN|0-06-250814-8}} pp.193-6 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Pagans believe that at Samhain the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year, making it easier to communicate with those who have left this world.&lt;ref name=DruryModernMagicalRevival /&gt;

===Minor festivals===
In addition to the eight major holidays common to most [[Paganism (contemporary)|modern Pagans]], there are a number of minor holidays during the year to commemorate various events.

*'''Summerfinding''', celebration which marks the beginning of summer, held on a date between Ostara and Walpurgisnight (mid-April)&lt;ref name=AsatruHolidays /&gt;&lt;ref name=Linzie /&gt;

==Dates of celebration==
The precise dates on which festivals are celebrated are often flexible. Dates may be on the days of the quarter and cross-quarter days proper, the nearest [[full moon]], the nearest [[new moon]], or the nearest weekend for secular convenience.  The festivals were originally celebrated by peoples in the [[middle latitudes]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Consequently, the traditional times for seasonal celebrations do not agree with the seasons in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] or near the equator. Pagans in the Southern Hemisphere often advance these dates by six months to coincide with their own seasons.&lt;ref name=DruryModernMagicalRevival /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia |last=Hume |first=Lynne |year=1997 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=9780522847826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vos|first=Donna|title=Dancing Under an African Moon: Paganism and Wicca in South Africa |year=2002|pages=79–86|publisher=Zebra Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9781868726530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodsworth|first=Roxanne T|title=Sunwyse: Celebrating the Sacred Wheel of the Year in Australia |year=2003|publisher=Hihorse Publishing|location=Victoria, Australia|isbn=9780909223038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Celebration commonly takes place outdoors in the form of a communal gathering.

===Sacrifice===
[[File:Romuvan ceremony (6).PNG|thumb|125px]]
{{See also|Blót|Holocaustos|Sacrificium Romanam|Thyesthai|Equus October|Ritual of oak and mistletoe|l1=Blótan}}
Offerings of food, [[libation|drink]], various objects, etc. have been central in [[ritual]] [[propitiation]] and [[Worship|veneration]] for millennia. Modern Pagan practice strongly avoids sacrificing animals in favour of grains, herbs, milk, wines, incense, baked goods, minerals, etc. The exception being with ritual feasts including [[ritual slaughter|meat]], where the inedible parts of the animal are often burned as offerings while the community eats the rest.&lt;ref name="adf_nos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Kirk|title=The Nature of Sacrifice|url=http://www.adf.org/articles/cosmology/nature-of-sacrifice.html|work=Cosmology|publisher=Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradbury|first=Scott|title=Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice|journal=Phoenix|year=1995|volume=49|issue=4 (Winter)|pages=331–356|jstor=1088885|doi=10.2307/1088885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacrifices are typically offered to gods and [[Ancestor veneration|ancestor]]s by [[Burnt offering|burning]] them. Burying and leaving offerings in the open are also common in certain circumstances. The purpose of offering is to benefit the venerated, show gratitude, and give something back, strengthening the bonds between humans and divine and between members of a community.&lt;ref name="adf_nos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wodening|first1=Galina Krasskova ; foreword by Swain|title=Exploring the northern tradition a guide to the gods, lore, rites, and celebrations from the Norse, German, and Anglo-Saxon traditions|date=2005|publisher=New Page Books|location=Franklin Lakes, NJ|isbn=9781435658943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meuli 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

While the various [[Celtic calendar]]s include ''some'' cyclical patterns, and a belief in the balance of light and dark, these beliefs vary between the different [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic cultures]]. Modern [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|preservationists and revivalists]] usually observe the four 'fire festivals' of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Calendar, and some also observe local festivals that are held on dates of significance in the different [[Celtic nations]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits 2006"&gt;{{cite book

{{See also|Slavic mythology}}
Slavic mythology tells of a persisting conflict involving [[Perun]], god of thunder and lightning, and [[Veles (god)|Veles]], the ''black god'' and ''horned god'' of the [[underworld]]. Enmity between the two is initiated by Veles' annual ascent up the [[world tree]] in the form of a [[Zmey|huge serpent]] and his ultimate theft of Perun's [[Cattle in religion|divine cattle]] from the heavenly domain. Perun retaliates to this challenge of the divine order by pursuing Veles, attacking with his lightning bolts from the sky. Veles taunts Perun and flees, transforming himself into various animals and hiding behind trees, houses, even people. (Lightning bolts striking down trees or homes were explained as results of this.) In the end Perun overcomes and defeats Veles, returning him to his place in the realm of the dead. Thus the order of the world is maintained.&lt;ref name="cwm_sm"&gt;{{cite book

The idea that storms and thunder are actually divine battle is pivotal to the changing of the seasons. Dry periods are identified as chaotic results of Veles' thievery. This duality and conflict represents an opposition of the natural principles of earth, water, substance, and chaos (Veles) and of heaven, fire, spirit, order (Perun), not a clash of good and evil. The cosmic battle between the two also echoes the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion#Mythology|Indo-European narrative]] of a fight between the sky-borne storm god and [[chthonic]] [[dragon]].

On the ''great night'' ([[New Year]]), two children of Perun are born, [[Jarilo]], god of fertility and vegetation and son of the Moon, and [[Marzanna|Morana]], goddess of nature and death and daughter of the Sun. On the same night, the infant Jarilo is snatched and taken to the underworld, where Veles raises him as his own. At the time of the spring equinox, Jarilo returns across the sea from the world of the dead, bringing with him fertility and spring from the evergreen underworld into the realm of the living. He meets his sister Morana and courts her. With the beginning of summer, the two are married bringing fertility and abundance to Earth, ensuring a bountiful harvest. The union of Perun's kin and Veles' stepson brings peace between two great gods, staving off storms which could damage the harvest. After the harvest, however, Jarilo is unfaithful to his wife and she vengefully slays him, returning him to the underworld and renewing enmity between Perun and Veles. Without her husband, god of fertility and vegetation, Morana&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;and all of nature with her&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;withers and freezes in the ensuing winter. She grows into the old and dangerous goddess of darkness and frost, eventually dying by the year's end only to be reborn again with her brother in the new year.&lt;ref name="cwm_sm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hlobil"/&gt;

===Modern Wicca and Neo-druidism===
[[File:Wheel of the Year.JPG|thumb|150px|Painted Wheel of the Year from the [[Museum of Witchcraft]], Boscastle.]] 
{{Further|Wiccan views of divinity}}
In [[Wicca]], the narrative of the Wheel of the Year traditionally centres on the [[sacred marriage]] of [[Wicca#The God and the Goddess|the God and the Goddess]] and the [[God (male deity)|god]]/[[goddess]] duality. In this cycle, the God is perpetually born from the Goddess at Yule, grows in power at the [[vernal equinox]] (as does the Goddess, now in her ''maiden aspect''), courts and impregnates the Goddess at [[Beltane]], reaches his peak at the [[summer solstice]], wanes in power at [[Lammas]], passes into the underworld at [[Samhain]] (taking with him the fertility of the Goddess/Earth, who is now in her ''crone aspect'') until he is once again born from Her mother/crone aspect at Yule. The Goddess, in turn, ages and rejuvenates endlessly with the seasons, being courted by and giving birth to the [[Horned God]].&lt;ref name=DruryModernMagicalRevival /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Vivianne Crowley]]|title=Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Age|location=London|publisher=Aquarian Press|year=1989|isbn=9780850307375|pages=162–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess: 20th Anniversary Edition|year=1999|publisher=HarperOne|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780062516329|pages=197–213|author=[[Starhawk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccan, [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druid]], and eclectic Neopagans incorporate a narrative of the [[Oak King (archetype)|Oak King]] and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]] as rulers of the waxing year and the waning year respectively. These two figures battle endlessly with the turning of the seasons. At the [[summer solstice]], the Holly King defeats the Oak King and commences his reign.&lt;ref name=fer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar|first1=Janet &amp; Stewart Farrar ; with line illustrations by Stewart|last2=Farrar|first2=photographs by Ian David &amp; Stewart|title=A witches bible|date=1984|publisher=Magickal Childe|location=New York|isbn=093970806X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}} After the [[Autumn equinox]] the Oak King slowly begins to regain his power as the sun begins to wane.

{{Jewish feminism}}
'''Women of the Wall''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נשות הכותל, ''Neshot HaKotel'') is a multi-denominational feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=644}}: "The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists."&lt;/ref&gt; organization based in [[Israel]] whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the [[Western Wall]], also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the [[Torah]] and wearing religious garments (''[[tallit]]'', ''[[tefillin]]'' and ''[[kippah]]''). Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that place "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of those restrictions is that the Rabbi of the Western Wall has enforced gender segregation and limitations on religious garb worn by women.  When the "Women of the Wall" hold monthly prayer services for women on [[Rosh Hodesh]], they observe gender segregation so that Orthodox members may fully participate.  But their use of religious garb, singing and reading from a Torah have upset some members of the Orthodox Jewish community, sparking protests and arrests. In May 2013 a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html|title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=December 25, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-western-wall-prayer.html|title=Israel Approves Prayer Space at Western Wall for Non-Orthodox Jews|date=1 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]] in deference to the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-facing-crisis-as-Haredim-vow-to-quit-over-Western-Wall-pluralism-447102 Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism]. The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sales |first=Ben |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/26/suspension-of-western-wall-deal-leaves-jewish-leaders-feeling-betrayed/ |title=Suspension of Western Wall deal leaves Jewish leaders feeling betrayed – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2017-06-26 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/06/25/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/netanyahu-rescinds-pluralistic-western-wall-agreement |title=Israel freezes Western Wall compromise that was to create egalitarian prayer section &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronit Kampf, the group's struggle has been "the most covered women's issue in the history of the Israeli media."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haberman|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Western Wall before sunset.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western Wall (August 2012)]]
From the start, Women of the Wall included Orthodox members and opted to run their service according to "Orthodox standards." Nevertheless, some Orthodox individuals were offended, including some who call themselves Orthodox feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|p=184}}: "A third reason for choosing Orthodox services was out awareness that if we did not adopt Orthodox standards, Orthodox women would not attend our services or, in all likelihood, support our struggle. Non-Orthodox women who have been involved in the Kotel struggle have been most generous in allowing Orthodox practice to prevail, and our services at the Kotel as well as the solidarity services we sponsored elsewhere therefore have been conducted in accordance with Orthodox standards. Despite this many Orthodox women, even those who were active in women's ''tefillah'' groups and leaders of Orthodox feminism, remained reticent and ambivalent about our struggle to pray at the Kotel, and Orthodox rabbis, even those who permitted women's ''tefillah'' their synagogues, did not support our right to pray in an identical fashion at the Kotel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "The movement, which is controversial, even among Orthodox feminists, myself included..."&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational group, including Reform, Conservative and Orthodox members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.679974 Amid Violence, Women of the Wall Vote Not to Engage Police This Month] Haaretz, Oct 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the group has faced a legal battle for recognition of their right to pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the [[Fast of Esther]] 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults at the women, which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, police arrested two [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a ''tallit''. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from the Orthodox also stems from Halachic concerns and from a general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a ''[[minyan]]'' (prayer quorum) and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|Young|1999|p=207}}: "Known as "the Women of the Wall," these women, out of deference to the group's Orthodox members, have used traditional liturgical texts and have not considered themselves to be a ''minyan''. Halakhically, at least as understood by Orthodoxy, women cannot constitute or count as members of a prayer quorum. Nonetheless, they have become the target of great opposition and occasional violence from ultra Orthodox Jews. [...] Women of the Wall continue to face opposition from ultra Orthodox Jews who are against women's prayer groups in general.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|Rubio-Marin|2005|p=214}}: "The Women of the Wall organization represents a group of observant Jewish women who pray together in a ''minyan'' -  a religious quorum traditionally reserved for men. This form of collective worship is not acceptable to ultra-Orthodox Jews when practiced by women."&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambré|2002|p=12}}: "But, at the kotel, where tradition trumps individual choice, the guidelines have not changed because they are not only a matter of acknowledging the desires of this group, which itself would radically alter Jewish tradition, but because the group lacks the support of any major religious authority. At the same time, acceding to their requests might also mean giving parity to non-Orthodox denominations."&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters highlighted the fact that only in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "Supporters of the Women of the Wall note the irony that "only in Israel, and at the site most holy to Jews...are Jewish women prohibited from praying aloud in a group with a Torah."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|2005|p=552}}: "In 2003, the Women of the Wall, a group of more than 100 Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform women, lost their 14-year legal battle to hold formal women's prayer services at the Western Wall. The High Court ruled that the group could not hold prayer services at the Western Wall and instead would be permitted to hold them at nearby Robinson's Arch."&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 2013.

Some Orthodox feminist organisations have voiced support for their right to pray at the Kotel.&lt;ref name=Maltz0613&gt;{{cite news|last=Maltz|first=Judy|title= The new Orthodox face of Women of the Wall|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/the-new-orthodox-face-of-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.516416/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=April 19, 2013}}: "Although Women of the Wall is widely associated with the Reform movement, it is very much based on an Orthodox model, says Elana Sztokman, the executive director of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, an international organization based in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was created by Jewish women, including some from the diaspora,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}: "Initiated in 1988 by North American women, the Women of the Wall have been trying to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem with Torah reading as the women's tefillah (prayer) groups do in America."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=202}}: "The story of the Women of the Wall began on December 2, 1988, when a group of approximately 100 women participants in the First International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem held a prayer service at the Western Wall. American-born women for the most part, they were accustomed to the more egalitarian religious practises that characterize American Judaism."&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant number of participants are American immigrants or part of the English-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}: "The Israeli women, most of whom were American-born, pledged to return to the Wall on the first day of each month in order to carry out a prayer service."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-David|2003|p=26}}: "It is not surprising that a disproportionate number of the Women of the Wall are, like Ner-David, American immigrants, or part of the larger native English-speaking Israeli community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}: "While noted in Israel, these incidents receive far more attention in the United States. The main reason for the publicity is that the worshipers drawing ire are disproportionately American."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|1991|p=298}}: "Women of the Wall, organized to literally and metaphorically break down the barriers to women's prayer at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Most of the initiators and participants in these activities have been immigrants from English-speaking countries."&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the differing social conditions of Orthodox women in the United States and Israel respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Satlow|2006|p=67}}: "By and larger, Israeli Orthodox women focus their religious life domestically. The growing difference between the roles of women in Western and Israeli Orthodoxy is in part due to social conditions. Whereas in the United States, for example, the push toward increasing female participation in religious services is primarily driven by highly educated, professional women who experience a gap between their high-status place in the secular world and their confinement behind the mechitza in the synagogue, the achievement of higher education and high-status jobs by Orthodox women in Israel is far rarer."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Rosner]] describes the phenomena as an "American-imported battle" for religious pluralism, religious moderation and tolerance. He notes that civil rights and feminism are American imports, late in coming to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;(Renee Ghert-Zand). [http://www.timesofisrael.com/where-rock-star-anat-hoffman-turns-raging-feminist/ Where ‘rock star’ Anat Hoffman turns raging feminist], ''Times of Israel'',(April 20, 2013). ""The whole battle for the Western Wall is an Americanized and American-imported battle for religious moderation and tolerance," explains Shmuel Rosner, senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and L.A. Jewish Journal columnist. "Women wearing a tallit is not something Israelis are used to. They don't necessarily have negative feelings about it, but it's just strange and feels like it doesn't belong here."" and "Many Israelis dismiss Women of the Wall as foreign interlopers, "but there is something to be said about Women of the Wall appearing non-native," Sztokman offers. "Civil rights and feminism are American imports — and late in coming. But now these things are being adapted to the local context."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:WOW Torah Reading.jpg|thumb|WOW Torah Reading]]
Twenty-five years after the founding of WoW, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute in May 2013 found that about half of the Israel public supports the Women of the Wall, and that men (51.5%) are more inclined to support the women's prayer group than women (46%) The poll was conducted by Professor Tamar Hermann, who noted that Women of the Wall received highest levels of support from educated, secular, Ashkenazi Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-half-of-israelis-support-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.523651|title=Poll: Half of Israelis support Women of the Wall|date=13 May 2013|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group was not always met with support from the majority of Israelis, as it is today.

Women of the Wall was founded in December 1988 at the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1988, during the conference, Rivka Haut organized a group of multi-denominational women to pray at the Western Wall. 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the [[Western Wall]], and Rabbi [[Deborah Brin]] led a prayer service for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahalatshalom.org/who-we-are/our-rabbi/78-about/163-women-of-the-wall-founding-rabbi-deborah-brin.html|title=Women of the Wall founding Rabbi Deborah Brin - Nahalat Shalom|author=Judy B|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Klagsbrun]] was the one chosen to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women led by Bonna Devora Haberman continued to meet at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/WOW.html |first=Sarah |last=Szymkowicz |title=Women Of The Wall |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall has fought a legal battle asserting a right to conduct organized prayer at the Kotel and challenging government and private intervention in its efforts. After demanding police protection, the government was given nine months to make arrangements that would allow them to pray unhindered. At the end of this period, the Ministry of Religion ruled that only prayer according to the "custom of the place" was to be permitted and that "the sensitivities of other worshippers" must not be offended.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women of the Wall then petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize their right to pray at the Wall. A temporary ruling was given which stated that the ''status quo'' should be enforced until they reached a final verdict.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"/&gt;

The legal battles between the High Court of Justice and the Women of the Wall continued between 1995 and 2000. The Israeli government did not uphold the position that they would find a way for the Women of the Wall to pray, which resulted in an appeal from the Women of the Wall to the High Court of Justice in 1995. This concluded in April 1996, determining the solution was to move the Women of the Wall's prayer from the Western Wall to the Robinson's Arch. Robinson's Arch was not in the area of main prayer. The Women of the Wall appealed this decision to the Ne'eman Committee in 1998, who reaffirmed the previous decision of the High Court Justice. The Women of the Wall accepted the decision on the condition that the area they were being moved to be set up to be a proper prayer area. The government did not do such preparations of the prayer area in Robinson's Arch, resulting in the appeal to the Supreme Court in 2000 by the Women of the Wall. In this appeal, the supreme court ruled that the Israeli government was required to allow the Women of the Wall to exercise their religious freedom and practices at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=2016-04-02|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=79–107|doi=10.1353/sho.2016.0001|issn=1534-5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle has led to two Israeli Supreme Court decisions and a series of debates in the [[Knesset]]. In its first decision, on May 22, 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that it is legal for Women of the Wall to hold prayer groups and read Torah in the women's section of the main Kotel plaza undisturbed. Four days later, [[Haredi]] political parties including [[Shas]] introduced several bills to overturn the decision, including a bill that would have made it a criminal offense for women to pray in non-traditional ways at the Western Wall, punishable by up to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; In response MK Naomi Chazan said "What have we become? Afghanistan? Iran?"&lt;ref name=LAT2000/&gt; Although the bill did not pass, the Israeli Supreme Court reconsidered its earlier decision. On April 6, 2003, the Court reversed itself and upheld, 5-4, the Israeli government's ban prohibiting the organization from reading Torah or wearing tallit or tefillin at the main public area at the Wall, on the grounds that such continued meetings represented a threat to public safety and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030423.html|title="The Israeli Supreme Court Denies Women The Right to Pray at the Western Wall", Findlaw.

Until recently, it was illegal for them to do so under Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/middleeast/22jerusalem.html?_r=0 Challenging Traditions at the Heart of Judaism], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2009. "After a lengthy legal battle, the court ultimately ruled against the women in the interest of public order. Consequently, it is illegal for them to read aloud from the Torah or to wear prayer shawls openly by the wall."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, following pressure from non-Orthodox US Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/women-of-the-wall-urge-jerusalem-police-to-refrain-from-arrests-at-upcoming-service.premium-1.514734 Women of the Wall urge Jerusalem police to refrain from arrests at upcoming service], ''Haaretz'', (April 10, 2013) "Under pressure from the non-Orthodox Jewish world, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Sharansky several months ago to draft .."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natan Sharansky]], the chairman of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], was asked by the Prime Minister to find a solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/10/western-wall-resolve-prayer-rights Western Wall plan unveiled to resolve 24-year-old prayer rights dispute], (10 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the detentions at the wall in February 2013, Sharansky said "When I listen to the very partial presentation, I am fully with them — when I listen to the other side, I have to accept that they also have logic.

This attempt was endorsed by the government to solve the controversy of the wall, but in actuality, this arrangement would have led to the emergence of a new conflict. Instead of ending the quarreling by granting women full rights to worship at the existing wall, the women would have had to fight for recognition among the public at their new area. The area for the women would have been located in what is known as the Robinson's Arch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, three women MKs used their [[parliamentary immunity]] to don prayer shawls and join the Women of the Wall in a show of support after 10 women had been arrested the previous month. MK [[Stav Shaffir]] ([[Israeli Labor Party|Labour]]) said "I usually do not wear a ''tallit'', but it is my honor and duty to stand here and protect the rights of all Jews from around the world to pray as they desire and believe." [[Tamar Zandberg]] ([[Meretz]]) said: "I demand to enter. The extremist stream's interpretation of the Holy Places Law is unacceptable to me, and I refuse to leave the prayer shawl outside. I am a secular woman but I identify with these women's struggle for freedom of expression and religion." Subsequently, a number of MKs condemned their actions. MK [[Aliza Lavie]] ([[Yesh Atid]]), who herself supports the right of the women to assemble, said she was "shocked" that fellow MKs decided to blatantly disobey the law and ignore Supreme Court rulings. MK [[Miri Regev]] ([[Likud]]) called the MKs attendance a "provocation" and referred to the groups "anarchistic actions" which had "turned into a national sport among the extreme Left in Israel." MK [[Uri Ariel]] ([[Bayit Yehudi]]) called the women radicals and suggested that their "gross violations" at the site may lead to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Sharon.

In May 2013, after bowing to pressure from non-Orthodox diaspora Jews, the government issued a directive for the legal dispute to be solved. A subsequent Appellate Court ruling gave permission&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10018346/Women-win-the-right-to-pray-like-men-at-Jerusalems-Western-Wall.html Women win the right to pray like men at Jerusalem's Western Wall], Robert Tait, Daily Telegraph, (April 25, 2013) "Women's rights campaigners won a potential landmark legal victory after a judge ruled that they should be allowed to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, in a manner previously deemed only fit for men."&lt;/ref&gt; for the Women of the Wall to hold services at the site after deciding that their prayer and ritual were not against the "local custom" and since the women did not use physical or verbal violence, they could not be held responsible for any resulting disturbances. The Rabbi of the Western Wall, however, continues to view their presence as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=162 Response of the Rabbi of the Western Wall to the Women of the Wall’s Provocative Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

They have the support of large American non-Orthodox denominations, which view the issue of women's rights to pray at the Wall as a high-profile opportunity to promote gender-egalitarian Jewish prayer, which most Israelis have never experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/176312/women-and-orthodox-waver-over-plan-for-egalitarian/?p=all Women and Orthodox Waver Over Plan for Egalitarian Prayer at Western Wall], Nathan Jeffay, ''Forward'', (May 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They also want to remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reform.org.il/eng/About/NewsItem.asp?ContentID=1323 Women of the Wall: The Controversy Continues], Israel Movement for Reform &amp; Progressive Judaism, (March 18, 2013) "In January, 2013, WOW, the IMPJ and IRAC joined other organizations in filing a petition with the High Court of Justice against the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, demanding that non-orthodox Jews and women receive equal representation for managing the Wall, and requested the court "remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi."&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests have been criticized by groups promoting religious pluralism in Israel. The Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), condemned the arrest of Anat Hoffman and called it a "desecration of God's name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Reform-Rabbis-Issue-Statement-Outrage-Israels-Arrest-Woman-Holding-Torah-Western-Wall-1289352.htm|title=Reform Rabbis Issue Statement of Outrage at Israel's Arrest of Woman for Holding Torah at Western Wall|work=Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Women of the Wall launched a campaign to encourage girls to have their bat mitzvah services at the Kotel. Unlike most diaspora Jewish girls, Israeli Jewish girls typically do not celebrate a bat mitvah by reading from their Torah portion. The ad campaign features girls wearing prayer shawls and holding a Torah scroll in front of the wall. The ad, placed on Israeli buses, has the caption, "Mom, I also want a bat mitzvah at the Kotel!" The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is controlled by the Orthodox and oversees events at the wall, not only runs a business of bar mitzvahs for boys that has excluded girls from their offerings, but has refused to permit women to carry Torah scrolls at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.620543|title=Women of the Wall bus ad campaign encourages bat mitzvahs at the Kotel|date=13 October 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campaign ads were soon vandalized in Orthodox neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/207262/women-of-wall-push-for-bat-mitzvahs-at-western-wal/|title=Women of Wall Push for Bat Mitzvahs at Western Wall|date=13 October 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad campaign received international publicity when religious extremists carried out violent attacks in Jerusalem. About fifty Jewish men in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim engaged in hurling rocks and slashing tires of public buses carrying ads for the egalitarian services for girls.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ultra-orthodox-jews-attack-jerusalem-buses-over-ad/2014/10/21/62c92540-5907-11e4-9d6c-756a229d8b18_story.html|title=Ultra-Orthodox Jews attack Jerusalem buses over ad|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, 2014 a [[Bat Mitzvah]] was celebrated by the group at the wall using a miniaturized Torah scroll which they smuggled in. Although the women have won the legal right to pray in their fashion at the wall, Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the Supervisor of the Western Wall, has refused to allow the women to use the Torah scrolls distributed in the men's section or to bring their own. The group said that a reading from the Torah scroll in the women's section was an historic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Women-of-the-Wall-smuggle-tiny-Torah-scroll-to-Western-Wall-for-Bat-Mitzva-379719|title=Women of the Wall smuggle tiny Torah scroll to Western Wall for Bat Mitzva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2014 Women of the Wall held a women's candle lighting at the Kotel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt; Wow sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section just as there is one in the men's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act." Initially, the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.'

In April 2015 Women of the Wall participated in reading from a full-size Torah scroll at the organization's service at the Western Wall. One hundred Torah scrolls are kept for the use of the men's side of the Western Wall and male supporters of Women of the Wall passed a Torah scroll across the barrier into the women's section for Women of the Wall's service.

Police intervened and stopped them. Following the Torah reading service, WoW members in the women's section danced with the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.652640 Women defy Western Wall ban and read from full-size Torah] Haaretz, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;"This is the first time that Women of the Wall can stand up and be counted as a part of the public," proclaimed Anat Hoffman, the chair of WoW. "Nothing you could say could tear me away from my Torah." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, the head of the rabbinic authority of the Western Wall, called the women's Torah reading a provocation and said "the Israel Police and employees of the Western Wall had to work hard in order to avoid bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-women-of-the-wall-pray-with-full-sized-torah-scroll/ In First, Women of the Wall pray with Full-Size Torah scroll] The Times of Israel, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; A group calling itself Original Women of the Wall, which includes founding members of WoW and which contends that WOW has broken away from the original and on-going charter of the group. Original Women Of the Wall does not agree with the compromise and said its members will continue to hold prayer services at the Western Wall, praying as is their custom, with prayer shawls and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Original-Women-of-Wall-reject-compromise-at-site-443215 Original Women of Wall reject compromise at site] The Jerusalem Post, Feb 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Minister of Waqf and Religious Affairs Youssef Ideiss protested that the proposed egalitarian prayer section at the Western Wall violates the status-quo agreement governing the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-cry-foul-over-planned-mixed-gender-western-wall-section/ Palestinians cry foul] The Times of Israel, Feb 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 MK [[Meir Porush]] was reprimanded by the Knesset ethics committee in 2016 because they determined that he "deviated radically and blatantly from the accepted way to express oneself in the Knesset or what is appropriate for an MK." In a speech before the Knesset Porush said that the Women of the Wall should be "thrown to the dogs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2016/03/29/default/knesset-ethics-panel-reprimands-haredi-lawmaker-who-slammed-women-of-the-wall Knesset ethics panel reprimands haredi lawmaker who slammed Women of the Wall] JTA, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The committee noted that such "scornful" remarks would be "deplored harshly" had they been spoken about Jews by any other government outside Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-scolds-mk-for-disparaging-feminist-prayer-group/ Knesset scolds MK for disparaging feminist prayer group] The Times of Israel, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Porush responded by saying that if "Women of the Wall" refrained from eating non-Kosher food, he would apologize to them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=12030 Ethics Committee reprimands MK Porush for his remarks against "Women of the Wall"] Knesset, March 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

|In response to the ruling allowing the Women of the Wall to hold their services at the site, between 5,000-10,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] girls converged to prevent the women from approaching. Police in turn offered protection to around 400 women who formed the largest gathering in the group's history. The women prayed together with a group of male supporters, the first time a mixed service had been held by the organisation. They had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the women's prayer section, but reneged upon the request of Minister of Religious Affairs [[Naftali Bennett]]. Three Haredi men were arrested for disturbing the peace. Chair of Women of the Wall, [[Anat Hoffman]], said "We are continuing in the footsteps of the paratroopers who liberated the Western Wall."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Women for the Wall]] is founded to campaign against the Women of the Wall.

|Threatening graffiti was sprayed on the front door of an executive board member of the Women of the Wall organisation. It read: "Peggy, you're the first. We know where you live. Jerusalem is holy. The Western Wall will not be forfeited. The Women of the Wall are villains." MK [[Michal Rozin]] ([[Meretz]]) blamed the attack on provocative statements by ultra-Orthodox MKs, and Jerusalem mayor [[Nir Barkat]] and his ultra-Orthodox deputy, Yitzhak Pindrus, denounced the act. Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]] of the Western Wall called it "a despicable incident," which "did not represent Judaism."

|It was reported that Chief Rabbis [[Yona Metzger]] and [[Shlomo Amar]] had received death threats. The letters stated that if the Women of the Wall are not allowed to pray according to their ways and custom, "we will fight you with all measures, and you will return home with 100 bodies of haredim... We will no longer practice restraint. We will re-liberate the Western Wall." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch had also received a similar letter. Women of the Wall said that the organization "had nothing to do with the act and that the style of these letters does not match the love of Israel spirit led by the group."

| [[United Torah Judaism]] arranged for between 5,000-7,000 Haredi girls to assemble at the wall and for the first time in 25 years, police prevented the Women of the Wall from approaching the site. Male protesters numbered around 1,000. The women, numbering around 300, held their service at the entrance to the Western Wall plaza and were occasionally disturbed by shouting and targeted at least twice by water bombs and eggs. An Orthodox man and women were arrested for public order offenses. [[Gilad Kariv]] of the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism|Reform Movement in Israel]] said the police had "given a reward to a small group of Haredi provocateurs and rabbis who deal in spreading baseless hatred." Orthodox Jerusalem deputy mayor Yitzhak Pindrus said "baseless hatred caused the greatest destruction to befall our people and we will not let a small group of agitators to continue to polarise with provocations and baseless hatred."

In their struggle for civil rights and religious freedom, members of the group have been willing to engage in civil disobedience and become "prisoners of conscience.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|pp=56–57}}: "But we might also have to go outside both the legal and political system. Would women be willing to do civil disobedience, get arrested? A[nat]: Absolutely! We are hoping that Shas actually passes the bill that would put us in jail for seven years. P[hyllis]: You would sit in jail for seven years? A: We have quite a few women who are willing to become prisoners of conscience. P: Prisoners of conscience . . .

Imagine what Amnesty International will do with this!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the group have been arrested for acts that Women of the Wall members say are legal under the Supreme Court ruling. Nofrat Frenkel was arrested for wearing a tallit under her coat and holding a Torah in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3807090,00.html|title=Police Arrest Woman Praying at the Western Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not charged, but she was barred from visiting the Wall for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/119509/,|title=The 'Crime' of Praying with a Tallit, and a Plea for Tolerance: First Person|date=24 November 2009|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's leader, [[Anat Hoffman]], was interrogated by the police in January 2010, fingerprinted, and told that she could be charged with a felony over her involvement with Women of the Wall. The questioning concerned WOW's December service, during which Hoffman said she did not do anything out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/122754/|title=Women of the Wall Leader Interrogated by Police|date=6 January 2010|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2013, ten women who were part of WOW, including two American rabbis, were detained for praying at the wall and "as a result of them wearing the garments that they're not allowed to wear specifically at that site."&lt;ref name=nytfeb&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|title=Women Praying at Western Wall in Jerusalem Are Detained|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/Women-Praying-at-Western-Wall-Detained.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were barred from returning for 15 days.

On April 11, 2013, five women were detained for allegedly goading and offending other worshippers. They were subsequently released by Judge Sharon Larry-Bavili without restrictions as she ruled that the female worshippers did not instigate the disturbance, but rather it was the male and female Orthodox protestors countering them that initiated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=YItzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2015, Women of the Wall board member Rachel Cohen Yeshurun was arrested by police in the prayer section of the Kotel after smuggling in a Torah Scroll to the Kotel in the early morning before the Rosh Hodesh service began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/women-of-the-wall-member-arrested-at-western-wall-with-torah/ |title=Women of the Wall member arrested at Western Wall with Torah |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2015-07-18 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1:19 pm |url=http://www.womenofthewall.org.il/women-of-the-wall-leader-arrested-with-a-torah-in-the-womens-section/ |title=Leader Arrested with a Torah in the Women's Section |publisher=Women of the Wall |date=2015-07-17 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2016, Women of the Wall Executive Director Leslie Sachs was detained by police for 'smuggling' a Torah into the Kotel, and according to a statement released by Women of the Wall detained for 'disturbing the public order'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/police-hold-women-of-the-wall-leader-for-smuggling-torah/ |title=Police hold Women of the Wall leader for 'smuggling Torah' |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2016-06-07 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2018, several Women of the Wall board members were briefly detained outside the Western Wall plaza by police demanding to see their ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nachshoni |first=Kobi |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5287506,00.html/ |title=Women of the Wall defy AG's ruling, leading to clashes |publisher=Ynet |date=2018-06-15 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women of the Wall's position==
The Women of the Wall have consistently claimed that there is no single "custom of the place" and that their right to pray is a religious freedom enshrined in Israeli law. They believe the Western Wall is a religious site as well as a national site and therefore belongs to the entire Jewish population. Their efforts to challenge the current customs at the Wall and break the ritual status quo continues as they believe that the Wall is a holy place for all Jews. They repeatedly stress that the group is not Reform Jews, but come from all affiliations and that their conduct strictly adheres to Orthodox Jewish Law and that their prayer is genuine and not a political stunt. Their central mission is to "achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall."  The women have made progress and as of 1988, the women have held occasional, uninterrupted prayer services wearing tallitot and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Orthodox establishment's position==
The Israeli Orthodox Jewish religious establishment is opposed to the services conducted by the Women of the Wall. Orthodox rabbis claim that even if such a manner of prayer is theoretically permitted by Jewish Law, it is against Jewish custom. Even if support can be found in Jewish legal sources for various activities, the force of custom is equal to absolute law and it is the custom which determines proper conduct. Various legal opinions recorded in Halacha cannot be manipulated to introduce new forms of prayer.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|pp=638–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], which is cited by Women of the Wall in support of their cause, is rejected by the establishment, as they view the Women of the Wall as being motivated by feminism rather than a sincere spiritual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Frimer, Arye and Dov, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm Women's Prayer Services Theory and Practice] ''Tradition'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Their struggle is also seen as an attempt to undermine their influence and as a strategy for non-Orthodox groups to gradually gain official recognition at state level, paving the way for the introduction of religious pluralism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012|p=}}: "The Israeli Orthodox establishment view the Women of the Wall as being a Trojan horse to introduce Jewish pluralism and establish the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist strains of Judaism in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the group, [[Yehuda Getz]], the government appointed rabbi of the Western Wall, urged them to stop "straying from the hallowed traditions of generations of Jews before you"&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"/&gt; and in 1989, the Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Avraham Shapiro]] and the Religious Affairs Minister suggested that the women "pray individually, silently, and preferably at home-not at the wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
From the outset, the Women of the Wall have been subjected to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose the Women of the Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment of Women of the Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

In 1996, UTJ MK [[Israel Eichler]] wrote: "No one prevents anyone else from praying at the wall in his own fashion, but the wall is the last place to carry out a battle for the right of a woman to wear a ''tallit'', read from the Torah, wear a ''kippa'' and grow a beard."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2000|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Yaakov Litzman]] stated that "there is no desecration greater than that of women who come to desecrate the holiness of the Western Wall with all kinds of provocations such as carrying a Torah scroll and other things reserved by Jewish law only to men"&lt;ref name= LAT2000&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/05/news/mn-37770 Israeli Women Defy Custom, Say a Prayer for Equality], June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ovadia Yosef said: "There are stupid women who come to the Western Wall, put on a tallit (prayer shawl), and pray... These are deviants who serve equality, not Heaven. They must be condemned and warned of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801872,00.html|title=Rabbi Yosef condemns Women of the Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]] suggested that it is "not religious need," but rather "religious politics" which motivates the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|Reinman|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Orthodox women have also disapproved of the group. [[Nehama Leibowitz]] likened their worship to a form of "sport,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterman|2009|p=296}}: "Nehama rejected the argument that women's spiritual needs must be met more fully than convention currently allows. Shira Leibowitz Schmidt recalls that Nehama "unsympathetically labeled as "sport" the untraditional, demonstrative prayer by Women of the Wall..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the widow of  Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] said the group had "gone completely mad" and their actions amount to "desecration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168688 Rabbanit Tzviya Eliyahu: Women of the Wall are 'Crazy'], ''Arutz Sheva'', (June 06, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-Orthodox former Jerusalem city councilwoman Mina Fenton said the women are "a fringe group that attracts people who read the prayer book upside down."&lt;ref name=USA10-05/&gt; The Religious Zionist leadership also voiced its concern in May 2013 when a group of influential rabbis issued a letter calling on public figures "not to let a small group offend the thousands of worshippers arriving to pray at this sacred place on a regular basis." They went on to state that "there are those who have been trying in recent years to change the present situation, offending many and tainting the special atmosphere of holiness of this sacred place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378184,00.html Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall], Kobi Nachshoni, ''ynet.com'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval included a wide range of name-calling, with Women of the Wall being called "witches," "prostitutes," "weird," "childish," and "provocateurs," for wanting to pray in their fashion. The Israeli state and Ministry of Religion referred to Women of the Wall as "witches," who were doing "Satan's work"; "more like prostitutes than women"; "misled, tainted, by modern secular feminism."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet indifference and condemnation for the women's plight came from all sectors of Israeli society, not just from the religious right. Even liberals saw their actions as a "provocation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2009|p=231}}: "However, even academics, intellectuals, and journalists generally committed to a liberal point of view were overtly hostile to the WOW. In newspaper articles and public discussion, they claimed that their actions were a "provocation."&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organisations in Israel viewed their behaviour as "weird and objectionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naveh|2003|p=130}}: "The WoW group has also failed to rally support from Israeli women's organizations: their struggle was and is still considered weird and objectionable."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Halkin]] called them "childish provocateurs"&lt;ref&gt;Halkin, Hillel.

Interestingly, their stance has not been overly sympathetic to the Women of the Wall,..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Klotz|1989}}: "The Israeli secular public cannot see why this issue is important to us."&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting a general hostility to feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halperin-Kaddari|2004|p=170}}: "Significantly, there has been little sympathy or understanding in the media for the women's cause, perhaps expressing Israeli society's general hostility to feminist causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "I fear that the general indifference at best, and hostility at worst, of the Jewish secular majority towards the Women of the Wall stems from the hostility to feminism in general. It has long been observed that feminism has not been kindly accepted in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Starr Sered|Susan Sered]] suggests the public saw the group as "symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=211}}: "The Women of the Wall are themselves seen as a symbol, symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site."&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that many in Israel saw the group as "American Reform interlopers trying to appropriate a state symbol of national identity."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"/&gt; Their demands were seen as radical and foreign to Israeli society&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|Safir|1991|p=16}}: "In the context of Israeli society, the demands of Women of the Wall represent unprecedented, radical demands. Jews in Israel, including the secular majority, generally accept the domination of Orthodoxy in religious matters, perhaps because they do not perceive it as meaningful to their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2006|p=133}}: "In Israel of the early 1990s, which experienced the surge of religion and the rise of religious political power, WOW's action was perceived as radical and unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; and their actions "alienated Israelis of almost all political persuasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the women at first received minimal [[grass-roots]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1999|p=157}}: "There has not been as much grass-roots support in Israel for the Women of the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt;  Lahav explains that secular indifference results from an acceptance of the view espoused by the Orthodox establishment when it comes to religious issues&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "A deeper reason has to do with the historical attitude of secular Zionism towards religion. From the perspective of the secular majority, Jewish religion is what the orthodox say it is. They fail to see in the women's fight a struggle to open up orthodoxy and make it more egalitarian; if they do, they do not consider it to be of any significance because they do not have an interest in religion anyway."&lt;/ref&gt; and that those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] of the political spectrum ignore the women in an attempt to gain Orthodox support for their dovish positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "Politically, the secular majority is interested in the orthodox sector only in as much as it can support their views concerning the peace process. The Left is impatient with the Women of the Wall because they pose yet another obstacle on the road to some Orthodox support of the dovish resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Right supports the orthodox (against the women) because it wishes to strengthen its bond with the religious sector, thereby guaranteeing more support for it hawkish opposition to the formula of land for peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the women initially came mainly from Reform and Liberal communities in North America. In 1990, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] encouraged its members to support Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1990|p=160}}: "Therefore be, it resolved that the CCAR encourage its members and their constituencies to support the Women of the Wall by writing to the Ministers of Religion and Justice, the Prime Minister, the Chief rabbis, public figures, and President of Israel about... b) Women having the option of joining prayer groups at the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] declared it "warmly commends the Women of the Wall for its courageous and principled struggle to be allowed to pray at the Western Wall" and urged Reform congregations to "express solidarity with the Women of the Wall in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org//about/union/governance/reso//?syspage=article&amp;item_id=1945 In Support of Women of the Wall], URJ, (June 4, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a number of non-Orthodox gatherings and services have been held publicly in America in solidarity with the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/132071/nyc-prayer-service-supports-women-of-the-wall NYC Prayer Service Supports Women of the Wall], ''Tablet, (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Reform movement, WOW has faced both support and criticism. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], who is considered the leader of the Reform movement in Israel, argued that WOW's request of 11 hours a year{{clarify|date=December 2017}} did not indicate an urgency that required a change in policy, but he came to support WOW's goals because they align with the Reform movement's opposition to the exclusion of women from religious society in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2013, however, about half of Israeli Jews approved of Women of the Wall and their mission, with the greatest support coming from educated Ashkenazi Jews. Pollsters for the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) and Tel Aviv University surveyed Jews in Israel and found that a clear majority, 64%, of those who defined themselves as secular, and 53% of those who described themselves as traditional but not religious supported the right of Women of the Wall to worship in their fashion. A minority of those who described themselves as traditional religious or Ultra-Orthodox approved. The results showed that overall,  51.8% of men and 46% of women supported Women of the Wall and their right to pray in their fashion at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-back-women-of-the-wall/ Almost half of Israeli Jews back Women of the Wall] Times of Israel, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinions==
Some Jewish feminist activists in Israel have seen the Women of the Wall's activities as being inconsistent with their political activities. Leah Shakdiel of the anti-war group [[Women in Black]] describes the Wall as "all maleness and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakdiel maintains that Israeli society's general opposition to the Women of the Wall is a result of a religious and secular alliance against what they perceive as a feminist challenge. Ran Hirschl believes the conflict is "a contest for cultural hegemony between a secularist-libertarian elite and traditionally peripheral group," namely the ultra-Orthodox community. [[Frances Raday]] posits that the violent opposition by Orthodox Jews stems from the "desire of the Orthodox establishment to preserve religious patriarchal hegemony against the challenge of religious feminism," rather than an attempt to preserve Jewish Law itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Chesler]] of Women of the Wall wrote: "We asked for our rights under civil and religious law. When we prayed, other worshipers, both men and women, verbally and physically assaulted us. We asked the Israeli state to protect us so that we could exercise our rights. The state claimed it could not contain the violence against us, and that we ourselves had provoked the violence by "disturbing/offending" the "sensibilities of Jews at worship." Women are not seen as "Jews" or as "worshipers" with "sensibilities."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"/&gt;

They follow the [[Shugendō]] doctrine, an integration of mainly [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] sect, with [[Tendai]] Buddhist, [[Taoism]], and elements of [[Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofugu.com/japan/yamabushi-japanese-mountain-people/|title=Japanese Mountain Folk|last=Hashi|website=Tofugu|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2017}} For the most part solitary, they did form loose confederations, and associations with certain temples, and also participated in battles and skirmishes alongside ''[[samurai]]'' and ''[[sōhei]]'' warrior monks on certain occasions. Their origins can be traced back to the solitary [[Yama-bito]] and some '''''hijiri''''' (聖) of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|date=1999|publisher=Japan Library|location=Richmond, Virginia|isbn=1873410859|pages=165-167|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been cross-teaching with samurai weaponry and Yamabushi's spiritual approach to life and fighting.{{Or|date=May 2017}}

In modern use, the term ''ubasoku-yamabushi'' refers to laymen practitioners of shugendō.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}} The religion places a heavy emphasis on asceticism and feats of endurance, and white and saffron-robed ''yamabushi'' toting a ''[[horagai]]'' conch-shell trumpet are still a common sight near the shugendō holy site of [[Dewa Sanzan]] and in the sacred mountains of Kumano and Omine.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}}

==History==
''Yamabushi'' began as ''yamahoshi'', isolated clusters (or individuals) of mountain hermits, ascetics, and "holy men", who followed the path of ''shugendō'', a search for spiritual, mystical, or supernatural powers gained through asceticism. This path may or may not have had a founder, as the myths surrounding [[En no Gyōja]] are numerous and complex; he is quite similar to a Japanese [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] in this way. Men who followed this path came to be known by a variety of names, including ''kenja'', ''kenza'', and ''[[shugenja]]''. These mountain mystics came to be renowned for their magical abilities and [[occult]] knowledge, and were sought out as healers or mediums, although [[Shinto shrines]] had traditionally reserved this role exclusively for maidens known as [[Miko]].

Most of these ascetics, in addition to their devotion to ''shugendō'', studied the teachings of the [[Tendai]] sect of Buddhism, or the Shingon sect, established by [[Kūkai|Kōbō Daishi]] in the 8th century. [[Shingon|Shingon Buddhism]] was one of the primary sects of ''mikkyō'' (密教) or [[Esoteric Buddhism]], according to which enlightenment is found through isolation, and the study and contemplation of oneself, as well as nature, and esoteric images called [[mandala]]. Both the Shingon sect and the Tendai viewed mountains as the ideal place for this sort of isolation and contemplation of nature.

In their mountain retreats, these monks studied not only nature and religious/spiritual texts and images, but also a variety of martial arts. Whether they felt they had to defend themselves from bandits, other monks, or samurai armies is questionable, but the idea of studying martial arts as a means to improve oneself mentally and spiritually, not just physically, has always been central to Japanese culture, beyond the specific tenets of one religious sect or another. Additionally, the Yamabushi developed their own forms of cooking that utilized vegetation that was naturally found on the mountains where they trained.  This cuisine allowed them to spend weeks or even months in the mountains without having to venture down into the towns or cities below to restock on supplies. Thus, like the ''sōhei'', the ''yamabushi''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehiddenjapan.com/yamabushi|title=Yamabushi Mountain Monks Of Yamagata|website=Yamagata {{!}} Shonai {{!}} The Hidden Japan|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; became warriors as well as monks.

As their reputation for mystical insight and knowledge grew, and their organization grew tighter, many of the masters of the ascetic disciplines began to be appointed to high spiritual positions in the court hierarchy. Monks and temples began to gain political influence. By the [[Nanboku-chō]] Period, in the 13th and 14th centuries, the ''yamabushi'' had formed organized cohorts called ''konsha'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yamabushi.org.uk/yamabushi.html|title=Yamabushi Page|website=Yamabushi Judo Club|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=October 2017}} and these ''konsha'', along with ''sōhei'' and other monks began to take direction from the central temples of their sects. They assisted [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] in his attempts to overthrow the [[Kamakura shogunate]], and proved their warrior skills to be up to the challenge of fighting professional samurai armies.

Several centuries later, in the [[Sengoku Period]], ''yamabushi'' could be found among the advisers and armies of nearly every major contender for dominion over [[Japan]]. Some, led by [[Takeda Shingen]], aided [[Oda Nobunaga]] against [[Uesugi Kenshin]] in 1568, while others, including the abbot [[Sessai Choro]], advised [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Many fought alongside their fellow monks, the ''[[Ikkō-ikki]]'', against [[Oda Nobunaga|Nobunaga]], who eventually crushed them and put an end to the time of the warrior monks.

Yamabushi also served as ''sendatsu'', or spiritual mountain guides, since medieval times for pilgrims along the [[Kumano Kodo]] to the Kumano Sanzan, including retired emperors and aristocrats.

[[File:Synagoga vinohrady zmanim 1916.png|thumb|Zmanim of [[Vinohrady (Prague)|Vinohrady]] synagogue in [[Bohemia]] from 1916 ''[[Prager Tagblatt]]'' newspaper.]]
'''Zmanim''' ({{lang-he-n|זְמַנִּים}}, literally "times", singular ''zman'') are specific times of the day in [[Jewish law]].

*In Jewish law, a [[Hebrew calendar#Day|calendar day]] is defined as running from "evening" to "evening."  This is based on the repetition of the phrase "... and there was evening, and there was morning ..."—evening preceding morning—in the [[Genesis creation narrative|account of creation in Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:13|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:23|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Gen|1:31|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Gen|2.2|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Additionally, Jewish law requires certain activities to be undertaken "during the day"—or at a certain time during the day—while other activities are to be undertaken "at night"—or at a certain time during the night.  
For either purpose, the status of the [[twilight]] hours just after [[sunset]] or just before [[sunrise]] is ambiguous. Judaism provides its own definitions for this period; at the same time, various rabbinic authorities differ on just how those definitions are to be applied for different purposes.

==Calculations==

===General approach===
The [[Talmud]] often states calculations of these ''zmanim'' in terms of the time it takes to walk some distance, stated in ''[[Biblical mile|mils]]''.  Most authorities reckon the time it takes to walk one ''mil'' as being 18 minutes, though there are opinions of up to 24 minutes.&lt;ref name="ZmanSource"&gt;{{cite web|title=MyZmanim Sources|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/messagebox.aspx?messageid=sources|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many authorities, indeed, hold such calculations to be absolute:  if nightfall follows sundown by "the amount of time it takes to walk four ''mils''," for example, that means "72 minutes after sundown" in all places on all dates.  Other authorities, especially those living in higher latitudes,&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"/&gt; noted that the darkness of the sky 72 minutes after sundown (for example) can vary substantially from place to place, and from date to date.  They therefore hold that "72 minutes after sundown" actually refers to how dark the sky is 72 minutes after sundown ''in Jerusalem on an equinox''.  Then that degree of darkness is reckoned as being true when the sun has fallen a certain number of degrees below the horizon (for example, 7°5′ below the horizon), and that becomes the actual standard used for all places and all dates.&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation by Degrees Explained|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/messagebox.aspx?messageid=degreesexplained|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evening===
One calendar day ends, and the next day begins, during the evening. The Talmud states there is an uncertainty as to whether the day ends at sunset or nightfall, so the time in between has a status of doubt. The Talmud in [[Pesachim]]&lt;ref name="Pes94a"&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim 94a)&lt;/ref&gt; states there are four ''[[Biblical mile|mil]]'' between sunset and nightfall. However, the Talmud in [[Tractate Shabbat]] states that there are just three-quarters of a ''mil'' between sunset and nightfall. 
*The ''[[Geonim]]'' and the [[Vilna Gaon|Vilna Gaon (GR"A)]] explain that the second statement is correct. 
*[[Rabbeinu Tam]] and many other [[Rishonim]] say rather that there are two "sunsets," the first of which [actual sunset] is four ''mil'' before nightfall, and the second of which is just three-quarters of a ''mil'' before.&lt;ref name="Zmanim Terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zmanim Terms|url=http://kehillatisrael.net/hcal/zmanim.html|publisher=Kehillat Israel|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the first opinion, nightfall is 13½-18 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, sun falls 3-4° below the horizon).  According to the second opinion, nightfall occurs exactly 72 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, when the sun has fallen anywhere from 6.45 to 16.1 degrees below the horizon).&lt;ref name="ZmanSource"/&gt;

In practice, when the question is whether it is too late to do a something that must be done ''by day,'' the practice is to follow one of the earlier opinions. When the question is whether it is too early to do something that must be done ''by night,'' the practice is to follow one of the later opinions.  For calculating the end of [[Shabbat]] or major holidays, the desire not to end Shabbat early, along with the Talmud's description of the end of Shabbat in terms of the appearance of stars in the sky, leads to the use of the later opinions.  (See [[#End of Shabbat|End of Shabbat]] below.)

===Morning===
There is also a difference of opinion as to when one may begin to do activities than must be done ''during the day:''  
*Daybreak, when some light is visible, or
*Sunrise, when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon.
The Talmud in Pesachim (see above)&lt;ref name="Pes94a"/&gt; holds symmetrically that the time between daybreak and sunrise is also the time in which one can walk four ''mils.''  For morning calculations, daybreak is normally held to be when the sun is 16.1° below the horizon, or a fixed 72 minutes or 90 minutes&lt;ref&gt;Based on a 22½ minute ''mil''&lt;/ref&gt; before sunrise.&lt;ref name="ZmanDeg"/&gt;

:A little after daybreak is a time known as ''misheyakir'', "when one can recognize [another person four cubits away]." This calculation is used as the earliest time to wear ''[[tzitzit]],'' and in parallel, [[tefillin]], because this is when the blue thread of the ''tzitzit'' can be distinguished from the white threads.  ''Misheyakir'' is always calculated relative to season and place, and occurs when the sun is either 10.2-11.5 degrees below the horizon.

===Seasonal hours===
{{main article|Relative hour (Jewish law)}}
For almost all halakhic purposes, each day is divided into twelve equal "hours." There are two major opinions: 
*The [[Magen Avraham]] holds that because one may do "daytime" activities between daybreak and nightfall, one calculates the day from daybreak to nightfall, and divides that period into twelve parts.  (Magen Avraham holds daybreak as 72 minutes before sunrise, and nightfall as 72 minutes after sunset, for this purpose.)
*The [[Vilna Gaon]] holds that although "daytime" activities can start as early as daybreak and end as late as nightfall, their proper time ''lechatchila (ab initio)'' is from sunrise to sunset, so one calculates the day from sunrise to sunset and divides ''that'' period into twelve parts.&lt;ref name="Zmanim Terms" /&gt; 
The result is that "Magen Avraham times" are earlier in the morning than "Vilna Gaon times"; in practice there are communities that follow each of those standards. For times in the afternoon, the Vilna Gaon's times are earlier, and are almost universally followed.

These are called "[[Relative hour (Jewish law)|seasonal]]" or "variable" hours because they depend on the length of time between sunrise (or daybreak) and sunset (or nightfall), and those vary through the year.  Near New York, for example, a "seasonal hour" based on the Vilna Gaon's calculations lasts around 45 minutes near winter solstice, around 60 minutes near the equinoxes, and around 75 minutes near summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zmanim for Highland Park (NJ)|url=http://www.myzmanim.com/day.aspx?vars=69590482|publisher=MyZmanim.com|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Times==

===Daybreak===
Daybreak (עֲלוֹת הַשַּׁחַר, ''Alot Hashachar'') refers to when the first rays of light are visible in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;But see Bi'ur Halacha 89, replacing daybreak with Ha'ir Pnei Mizrach.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If one has not recited the evening [[Shema]] by this time, and the omission was not due to negligence, one can still recite it now, up to sunrise, though one may not say [[Hashkiveinu]] or [[Baruch Hashem L'Olam (Maariv)|Baruch Hashem L'Olam]].
*If one has prayed [[Shacharit]] after this time, one has fulfilled his obligation ''ex post facto.'' Furthermore, most [[mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day (such as the [[Four Species]] or [[Hallel]]) may be done after this time, at least ''ex post facto.'' 
*One does not use [[tallit|tallis]] and tefillin before [[#Morning|''misheyakir'' (משיכיר)]].

===Sunrise===
Sunrise (הַנֵץ הַחַמָּה, ''Hanetz Hachamah'') refers to when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon. Technically, it is preferable to pray the morning Shema just before this time and begin the [[Amidah]] just afterwards, although this is rarely done nowadays. Most [[mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day (such as the [[Four Species]] or [[Hallel]]) should be done after this time ''ab initio.''

===Sof Zman Kriyat Shema===
''Sof Zman Kriyat Shema'' (סוֹף זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע) means "end of the time to say the [morning] [[Shema]]." This is three [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|halachic hours]] into the day. These hours are variable/seasonal hours and refer to one twelfth of the time between daybreak and nightfall (according to the [[Magen Avraham]]) ''or'' one twelfth of the time between sunrise and sunset (according to the [[Vilna Gaon]]).

===Sof Zman Tefilah===
''Sof Zman Tefilah'' (סוֹף זְמַן תְּפִלָּה) means "end of the time to say the [[Shacharit]] Amidah." This is four [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|(variable) hours]] into the day. The above comments apply here also. However, since the Amidah is only rabbinically required (unlike the Shema which is Scriptually mandated) it is common to rely on the later time, and few calendars publish the earlier time.

===Midday===
Midday (חֲצוֹת הַיּוֹם, ''Chatzot Hayom'' or just ''Chatzot'') means the midpoint between sunrise and sunset, or equivalently between daybreak and sundown. The absolute latest time for the Shacharit Amidah, ''ex post facto,'' is this time. On the [[Shabbat]] and on [[Jewish holidays|holidays]], one is supposed to eat before this time (except on [[Rosh Hashanah]]). On [[Tish'a Ba'av]] one may sit on a chair at this time, and those who fast on [[Erev Rosh Hashanah]] usually eat at this time.

===Mincha Gedolah===
''Minchah Gedolah''' (מִנְחָה גְּדוֹלָה, literally the greater [[Minchah]]), one-half [[Variable hour|variable hour]] after midday, is the earliest time to recite Minchah, although one should try, if possible, to wait until Minchah Ketanah (literally the smaller Minchah). On [[Yom Kippur]], the congregation ''must'' begin [[Mussaf]] by this time, because otherwise they would be required to [[Jewish prayer|pray]] the more frequent prayer (Mincha) first.

===Mincha Ketanah===
''Minchah Ketanah'' (מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, literally the smaller [window of praying] Minchah), two and one-half [[Variable hour|variable hours]] before sunset, is the preferable earliest time to recite Minchah.

===Plag Hamincha===
''Plag Hamincha'' (פְּלַג הַמִּנְחָה, literally half of the Minchah) is the midpoint between Minchah Ketanah and sunset, i.e. one and one-quarter [[Variable hour|variable hours]] before sunset. If one prayed Minchah before this time, one may recite [[Maariv]] afterwards (at the conclusion of the Sabbath, this may only be done under extenuating circumstances). Otherwise, one must wait until sunset, unless one is praying as a congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Plag Hamincha|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144443/jewish/Plag-Hamincha.htm|publisher=Chabad|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunset===
'''Sunset''' (שְׁקִיעַת הַחַמָּה, ''Shkiyat Hachamah'' - often referred to simply as ''{{visible anchor|'''ShKia'''}}''/''{{visible anchor|Sh'Kia}}''/''{{visible anchor|SheKia}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=OUkosher.org 
|title=Why do we light Shabbos candles eighteen minutes before shkia
|url=https://oukosher.org/halacha-yomis/light-shabbos-candles-eighteen-minutes-shkia-sunset}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the time at which the ball of the sun falls below the horizon. The new day begins at this point for almost all purposes. For example, the calendar date changes.
:Some sources indicate that if one ate an additional specified quantity of bread, and a meal eaten now includes the new day's additions in [[Birkat Hamazon|Grace after Meals]], then they are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/birchas-hamazon-on-rosh-chodesh
|title=Birchas Hamazon on Rosh Chodesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::Ex. ReTzei and YaaLeh VeYaVo on Shabbos Erev Rosh Chodesh, eating more Challah after ShKia

[[Mitzvot]] that must be performed during the day may no longer be performed ''ab initio.'' Minchah should not be delayed past now. Maariv may be recited now, although many wait until after nightfall.

Sunset's calendar date change effects include knowing how to match secular date of passing away with [[Yartzeit]] date.

===Bein Hashemashot===
''Bein Hashemashot'' (בֵּין הַשְּׁמָשׁוֹת, literally between the suns) is the period between sunset and nightfall, and is considered a time of questionable status. On the Sabbath, festivals, and fast days the stringencies of both the previous and following days apply. For example, if the fast of Tish'a Ba'av immediately follows the Sabbath, the intervening Bein Hashemashot is forbidden in eating, drinking, ''and'' [[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|working]]. However, there are occasional leniencies.

===Nightfall===
Nightfall (צֵאת הַכּוֹֹכָבִים, ''Tzet Hakochavim'') is described in detail [[#Evening|above]].  After nightfall, it is considered definitely the following day. All restrictions of the previous day go away, and any Mitzvot that must be performed at night (such as the evening [[Shema]], the [[Passover Seder|Seder]], or [[Bedikas Chametz]] may be performed.

====End of Shabbat====
מוצאי שבת, the End of Shabbat (or equivalently, the end of a festival or fast), is described in the Talmud as a time when "three medium stars are [visible] in the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starry Starry Night|url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/176/Q2/|publisher=Ohr Sameyach|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is much discussion of what this means, and not to end Shabbat "too" early, it tends to be construed strictly in practice.  There are various observed practices, all of which have support in the halachic literature:
*Appearance of three medium-sized stars in the sky.
*Appearance of three small stars.
*72 minutes after sundown ("opinion of [[Rabbeinu Tam]]"). Common practice in [[Chasidism|Chasidic]] and other [[Charedi]] communities. 

===Midnight===
Midnight (חֲצוֹת הַלַּילָה, ''Chatzot Halaylah'' or just ''Chatzot'') is the midpoint between nightfall and daybreak, or equivalently between sunset and sunrise. The evening Shema should be recited by now, and the [[Afikoman]] on Passover should be eaten by this time. The Talmud in Berachot rules that all "night" mitzvot should be performed by ''Chatzot,'' at least ''ab initio,'' in case the person would otherwise fall asleep and then fail to perform the mitzvot.  Some rise at this time and recite ''Tikkun Chatzot'', a series of supplications for the rebuilding of the Temple.

===Other zmanim===
On the Eve of [[Passover]], [[chametz]] may not be eaten after four variable hours, and must be burned before five variable hours.

The [[Mussaf]] [[Jewish prayer|prayer]] should preferably be recited before seven variable hours, on days it is recited.
