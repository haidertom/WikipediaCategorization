"National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP): 10 Essential Public Health Services." Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/essentialservices.html. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Organized according to the "three fundamental purposes of public health" — assessment, policy development, and assurance — the essential services include the following:

===Assessment===
*Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems.
*Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community.

===Policy development===
*Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues.
*Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems.
*Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts.

===Assurance===
*Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety.
*Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable.
*Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce.
*Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services.
*Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

==History==
In 1988, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, ''The Future of Public Health''. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in "disarray" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the "three fundamental purposes of public health." These purposes included "assessment, policy development, and assurance."&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health. (1988). The future of public health. Washington DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton’s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to
#explain what public health is,
#clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and
#provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.

These efforts culminated in the publication of ''The Essential Services of Public Health'' in late 1994.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;Harrell JA, Baker EL. The essential services of public health. Leadership Public Health. 1994;3(3): 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;
Public Health Units
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
The report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Scutchfield, F. D., Mays, G. P., &amp; Lurie, N. (2009). Applying Health Services Research to Public Health Practice: An Emerging Priority. Health Services Research, 44(5p2), 1775–1787. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref name="vi"&gt;Miller, C. A., K. S. Moore, T. B. Richards, and C. McKaig. 1994. "A Screening Survey to Assess Local Public Health Performance." Public Health Report 109 (5): 659–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vii"&gt;Turnock, B. J., and A. S. Handler. 1997. "From Measuring to Improving Public Health Practice." Annual Review of Public Health 18: 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viii"&gt;Handler, A. S., B. J. Turnock, W. Hall, S. Potsic, J. Munson, R. Nalluri, and E. H. Vaughn. 1995. "A Strategy for Measuring Local Public Health Practice." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 11 (6 Suppl): 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/ National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)]. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as "the fundamental framework" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments — The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment — and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

==List of services==

===Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems===
It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community’s health status.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;County of Los Angeles Public Health. "Frequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles County Health Survey" Retrieved from http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/LAC HS_FAQs.htm. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.

===Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community===
In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, [[bioterrorism]], mass casualties and chemical emergencies.

===Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues===
Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Choose Health LA. "Eat Healthy." Retrieved from http://www.choosehealthLA.com/eat-healthy/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055003/http://www.choosehealthla.com/eat-healthy/ |date=2013-02-17 }}. Accessed on 2/4/13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.

===Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems===
Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. [[First 5 LA]] is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;[[First 5 LA]]. "Champions of Our Children." Retrieved from http://www.first5la.org/About-Us. Accessed on 2/5/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.

===Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts===
Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&amp;nbsp;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;The New York Times. "New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary". Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?pagewanted=all. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Rammohan, V, et al. "Effects of Dram Shop Liability and Enhanced Overservice Law Enforcement Initiatives on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms: Two Community Guide Systematic Reviews." Am J Prev Med 2011;41(3):334 –343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety===
It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

===Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable===
Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="xiv"&gt;The White House. "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Overview of the Agency Operational Plans." Retrieved from http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213232017/http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce===
Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not. Components of this service include: making sure that the workforce meets the health needs of the population, maintaining public health workforce standards by developing and implementing efficient licensure and credentialing processes and incorporating core public health competencies into personnel systems, and adopting continuous quality improvement methods and long-term learning opportunities for public health workforce members.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In two 2002 reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended instituting a certification examination as a way of ensuring minimum competence in public health.&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "The Future of the Public’s Health in the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070844/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131227130612/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based training strategies may be useful in providing the long-term learning opportunities that many current and upcoming public health workers need in order to serve as well-informed advocates of public health and safety.&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Ballew, P. et al. "Developing web-based training for public health practitioners: what can we learn from a review of five disciplines?" Health Education Research. 2012;1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services ===
Given scarce resources, it is important to keep track of whether or not programs and/or policies end up producing intended outcomes. Components of this service include: assessing the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of services and programs delivered; providing policymakers with the information they need in order to make well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources; tracking efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services analyzing data on health status and service utilization; and striving to improve the public health system’s capacity to well serve the population.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis has been proposed as one possible strategy for informing policymakers on how best to allocate health care resources.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Eichler, H, Kong, SX, Gerth, WC, and Mavros, P. "Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care resource allocation decision-making: how are cost-effectiveness thresholds expected to emerge." Value in Health. 2004;7(5): 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems ===
Through research, the health and health care problems that individuals face can be better understood, and therefore be better and more appropriately addressed given the evidence provided by such research efforts. Components of this service include: fostering the development of a continuum of innovative solutions for health programming in terms of both practical field-based efforts as well as academic efforts, establishing a consortium of research institutions and other institutions of higher learning to encourage more collaborative and cross-cutting efforts, and ensuring the public health system’s capacity to perform timely epidemiological and health policy analyses.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">[[File:Apple for Health - Apple with Stethoscope (16348686815).jpg|thumb|It is commonly believed that apple consumption has health benefits.]]
'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered [[bad cholesterol]] levels in middle-aged adults.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; In 2013, the ''BMJ'' published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a [[statin]] a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=A. D. M.|last2=Mizdrak|first2=A.|last3=Scarborough|first3=P.|title=A statin a day keeps the doctor away: comparative proverb assessment modelling study|journal=BMJ|date=17 December 2013|volume=347|issue=dec17 2|pages=f7267–f7267|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7267|lay-url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255219148/an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-and-statins-do-too}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P. W.|last3=Sirovich|first3=Brenda E.|title=Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 May 2015|volume=175|issue=5|pages=777|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.5466|lay-url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-an-apple-a-day-really-keep-the-doctor-away/|pmc=4420713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘[[Golden Delicious]]’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/04/gardens-truth-about-apples-james-wong | title=Gardens: the truth about apples | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=James, Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the original [[Position (Obstetrics)|position]] of the fetus, either the left or the right shoulder can be the anterior shoulder. It is known as the anterior shoulder as it faces the [[anterior]] of the mother. This distinction between the anterior and the posterior shoulder is important as the anterior shoulder is delivered first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Archie|first= Carol L.|author2=Manoj K.

==Content==
The European Unions 2008 "'''C'''lassification, '''L'''abelling and '''P'''ackaging" regulation incorporates the classification criteria and labelling rules agreed at the UN level, the so-called Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). It introduced new classification criteria, [[european hazard symbols]] (pictograms) and [[Risk and Safety Statements]] for labelling, while taking into account elements which were part of the prior EU legislation.

The regulation requires companies to appropriately classify, label and package their substances and mixtures before placing them on the market. It aims to protect workers, consumers and the environment by labelling that reflects a particular chemical's possible hazards. It also addresses the notification of classifications, the establishment of a list of harmonised classifications and the creation of a classification and labelling inventory, as required by REACH.

==Implementation==
The regulation came into force in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagent.co.uk/chemical-glossary/#clpregs Chemical Glossary : CLP Regulation], reagent.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers and importers had already pre-registered more than 140,000 substances with the [[European Chemicals Agency]] under the REACH Regulation. They had until 1 December 2010 to propose "provisional classifications" for these substances, which have been used for the labelling of pure substances since that date. The deadline for classifying mixtures was 31 May 2015. The deadline for re-labelling and re-packaging of products already on the market was two years later: 1 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://newsletter.echa.europa.eu/de/home/-/newsletter/entry/labels-make-sure-you-re-legal-after-1-june-2017 Labels – make sure you’re legal after 1 June 2017]'', [[European Chemicals Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cancer registry''' is a systematic collection of data about [[cancer]] and [[tumor]] diseases. The data are collected by [[National Cancer Registrars Association|Cancer Registrar]]s. Cancer Registrars capture a complete summary of patient history, diagnosis, treatment, and status for every cancer patient in the United States, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Khatib|first1= O|last2= Aljurf|first2= M|title= Cancer Prevention and Control in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: The Need for a Public Health Approach|journal= Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther|volume= 1|issue= 1|date= Jan–Mar 2008|pages= 44–52|pmid= 20063528|doi=10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 1973 as a result of the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]]. The National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) was established by Congress through the Cancer Registries Amendment Act in 1992, and administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|title= About the Program|publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPCR and SEER together collect cancer data for the entire U.S. population. CDC and NCI, in collaboration with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, have been publishing annual federal cancer statistics in the United States Cancer Statistics: Incidence and Mortality report. Information maintained in the cancer registry includes: demographic information, medical history, diagnostic findings, cancer therapy and follow up details.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107205328/http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |title= Cancer Registrar FAQ|publisher= National Cancer Registrars Association|archive-date= 2011-11-07|accessdate= 2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is used to evaluate patient outcome, quality of life, provide follow-up information, calculate survival rates, analyze referral pattern, allocate resources at regional or state level, report cancer incidence as required under state law, and evaluate efficacy of treatment modalities.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo" /&gt;

There exist population-based cancer registries, [[hospital]] cancer registries (also called hospital-based cancer registries), and special purpose registries.

== History ==
In 1926, Yale-New Haven Hospital became the first to set up a cancer registry. In 1956, the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) formally adopted a policy to encourage, through their Approvals Program, the development of hospital-based cancer registries. In 1973, The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of NCI establishes the first national cancer registry program. In 1992, U.S. Public Law 102-515 establishes the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and is administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[http://training.seer.cancer.gov/registration/registry/history/dates.html]. By 1993, most states considered cancer a reportable disease.

== Population-based cancer registry ==

Population-based cancer registries monitor the frequency of new cancer cases (so-called [[incident cases]]) every year in well defined populations and over time by collecting case reports from different sources (treatment facilities, clinicians and [[pathologist]]s, and death certificates). The frequency of these incident cases are expected per 100,000 of the mother population. If an unexpected accumulation can be observed, a hypothesis about possible causes is generated. This hypothesis is investigated in a second step by collecting more detailed data. The aim is to recognize and to reduce risks. Population-based registries can also monitor the effects of preventive measures. All population-based central registries in the United States and Canada are members of the [[North American Association of Central Cancer Registries]]. This organization acts as a voice for the registries when dealing with national standard-setting organizations, sets standards for digital cancer record transmission, and certifies the registries for the quality of their data, among other functions.

== Hospital cancer registry ==

Hospital cancer registries aim at the improvement of [[cancer therapy]]. Therefore they have to collect detailed data about diagnosis and therapy. Improvements can be achieved by:

* comparison of therapy - which therapy is the best
* comparison of therapists - which hospital, which physician has the best results under the same conditions ([[quality management]])
* support of treatment - registries can improve information about a patient and help to provide an optimal treatment by planning therapies and generating reminders

== Cooperation of registries ==

Since the data needed by hospital cancer registries usually include those of population-based cancer registries and both use the same [[Medical classification|classifications]], data can be sent from a hospital cancer registry to a population-based registry thus reducing documentation efforts.

== Cancer reporting standards ==

Hospital and population-based cancer registries report their incidence data to national organizations that aggregate and publish the data. The way in which these data are formatted to be submitted to these organizations are determined by standards released by standard-setting organizations. Edits are run on the data to check for inaccuracies and duplicate cases before being submitted electronically. Different organizations have different standards for data reliability and completeness, and some award certifications based on the adherence to these standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.naaccr.org/Certification/WhoisCertified.aspx |title= Who is certified|publisher= North American Association of Central Cancer Registries|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SEER Registries==

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute collects and publish data on cancer incidence and survival throughout the United States. The information from population-based cancer registries covers approximately 28 percent of the US population. This coverage includes 26 percent of African Americans, 41 percent of Hispanics, 43 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 54 percent of Asians, and 71 percent of Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders.  The SEER program population-based cancer registries include Arizona Indians, Cherokee Nation, Connecticut, Detroit, Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics (Atlanta, Great Georgia, and Rural Georgia), Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose-Monterey), Greater California, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Los Angeles, Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Seattle-Puget Sound, and Utah. Selection of the geographic areas is based on the ability to operate and maintain a high quality population-based cancer reporting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Overview of the SEER Program|url= http://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html|publisher= National Cancer Institute|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)==

The program has state-based cancer registries that collect, analyze and report cancer cases and deaths to a central cancer registry. NPCR was established in 1992 and administered by the CDC.  NPCR supports central cancer registries in 45 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Pacific Island Jurisdictions (covers approximately 96% of the U.S. population). State Cancer Registries monitor cancer trends, determine cancer patterns, direct planning and evaluation of cancer control programs, help set priorities for allocating health resources, promote research, and provide information on cancer incidence.
The data collected helps public health professionals understand and address the cancer burden. The ninth volume of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, published by International Agency for Research on Cancer, includes cancer incidence data from 32 NPCR-funded registries. NPCR’s future direction is to expand the use of information technology designed to support, improve, and enhance the management and exchange of electronic data in cancer surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= National Program of Cancer Registries|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swedish Cancer Registry==

The Swedish Cancer Registry was established in 1958. The health care providers in Sweden are required to report newly detected cancer cases diagnosed at clinical, morphological, and laboratory examination (as well as those discovered during autopsy) to the registry. Every year, the regional registries send cancer data to the National Cancer Register. The information available in the registry include patient’s personal information (PIN, sex, age and place of residence), medical records (date of diagnosis, site of the tumor, method used for diagnosis, and hospital where the patient is being treated), and follow-up data (date and cause of death or date of migration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Swedish Cancer Registry|url= http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/register/halsodataregister/cancerregistret/inenglish|publisher= [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chelates ( che·late ) [kee-leyt] in [[animal feed]]''' are organic forms of essential trace minerals such as [[copper]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and [[zinc]].

[[Animal]]s absorb, digest and use mineral chelates better than inorganic minerals. This means that lower concentrations can be used in animal feeds. In addition, animals fed chelated sources of essential trace minerals excrete lower amounts in their faeces, and so there is less environmental contamination. Mineral chelates also offers health and welfare benefits in [[animal nutrition]]

==Brief History of Chelates ==
{{see also|Minerals}} 
Since the 1950s, animal feeds have been supplemented with essential [[trace mineral]]s such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), [[iodine]] (I), manganese (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[selenium]] (Se) and zinc (Zn). Initially, such supplementation was by means of inorganic salts of essential trace elements. From the 1960s onwards, genetic improvement of farm livestock resulted in increased nutritional requirements for these nutrients. [[Chelated minerals]] were developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Trace mineral chelates have proven to be better than inorganic minerals in meeting the nutritional needs of modern [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(McCartney, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role and source of minerals ==

The objective of supplementation with trace minerals is to avoid a variety of [[deficiency disease]]s. Trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]], most notably as [[catalyst]]s for [[enzyme]]s and [[hormone]]s, and are essential for optimum health, growth and productivity. For example, supplementary minerals help ensure good growth, bone development, [[feather]]ing in birds, [[hoof]], [[skin]] and [[hair]] quality in mammals, enzyme structure and functions, and appetite. Deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms, such as poor growth and [[appetite]], reproductive failures, impaired [[immune response]]s, and general ill-thrift. From the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was in the form of inorganic minerals, and these largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases in farm animals.

The role in [[fertility]] and reproductive diseases of [[dairy cattle]] highlights that organic forms of Zn are retained better than inorganic sources and so may provide greater benefit in [[disease prevention]], notably [[mastitis]] and [[Lameness (equine)|lameness]]

[[File:Chickens feeding.jpg|thumb|right|Poultry and nutrition]]

===Sources of essential minerals===
In recent decades, global food animal production has intensified and genetic potential for growth and yields has improved. As a result, commercial tendencies have been to increase trace [[Mineral supplements|mineral supplementation]],in order to allow for the greater mineral requirements of superior stock reared under industrial conditions. Increasing the concentration of inorganic minerals in animal diets has led to several problems.

The use of high Cu in [[swine]] and [[poultry]] rations has caused accidental Cu poisoning in more sensitive animals, such as [[sheep]] grazing pastures fertilised with pig or poultry [[manure]]  SCAN (2003a) Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of copper in feedingstuffs. Secondly, inorganic minerals may form insoluble complexes with other dietary agents resulting in low absorption. In addition, it is thought that the positive charge of many inorganic minerals reduces access to the [[enterocyte]]s due to repulsion by the negatively charged [[mucin]] layer and competition for binding sites.

Finally, the poor retention and high [[excretion]] rates of inorganic minerals led to environmental concerns during the 1980s and 1990s, especially in [[Europe]] .Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of zinc in feedingstuffs]. The [[European Union]] is concerned about possible detrimental effects of excess supplementation with trace minerals on the environment or human and animal health, and so in 2003 legislated a reduction in permitted feed concentrations of several [[trace metal]]s (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn).&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2003 of 25 July 2003 amending the conditions for authorisation of a number of additives in feedingstuffs belonging to the group of trace elements. 26.7.2003 EN Official Journal of the E.U.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in trace element [[nutrition]] has led to the development of more bioavailable organic minerals, including trace minerals derived from chelates. Chelates allow a lower supplementation rate of trace minerals with an equivalent or improved effect on animal health, growth and productivity .

==Particular types of Chelates ==

;They are in summary;
*[[Chelates]], are [[organic molecule]]s, normally consisting of 2 organic parts with an essential trace mineral occupying a central position and held in place by [[covalent bond]]ing.
*Proteinate, are a particular type of chelate, in which the mineral is chelated with short-chain [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s derived from [[Hydrolyzed protein|hydrolysed soy proteins]] and contain roughly 10-20% of the trace mineral. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} In proteinates, minerals are bound to various amino acids with different levels of stability
*Amino-acid complex, such as glycinates or methionates, are other particular types of chelate, in which the mineral is chelated with an amino acid. Based on one single type of amino-acid, the product is pure (there is only one type of bond or chelation between minerals and the ligand) and it is therefore easier to work on stability and ensure a full chelation. Moreover, depending on the size of amino acid, it is also possible to increase the metal content

Some notice concluded that the utilisation of organic Cu from a copper chelate  or copper lysine were higher than that of inorganic Cu sulfate when fed to rats in the presence and absence of elemental Zn or Fe. The data suggest that, unlike inorganic Cu, organic Cu chelates exhibit absorption and excretion mechanisms that do not interfere with Fe. Copper chelate also achieved higher liver Zn, suggesting less interference at gut absorption sites in comparison with the other forms of Cu.&lt;ref&gt;quote by Du et al.,1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.

Effect of organic zinc sources on performance, zinc status and carcass, meat and claw quality in fattening bulls. Livestock Prod.&lt;ref&gt;Sci. 81:161-171.&lt;/ref&gt; compared a Zn chelate, a Zn [[polysaccharide]] complex and ZnO (inorganic [[zinc oxide]]) in bull [[beef cattle]], and concluded that the organic forms resulted in some improvement in hoof claw quality.

Compared the [[bioavailability]] of Cu and Zn chelates in sheep with the inorganic sulfate forms, at "low" and "high" supplementation rates. Copper and Zn chelates at the lower rates caused significantly greater increases in [[blood plasma]] concentrations than the corresponding treatments with Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05) and Cu sulfate (p&lt;0.01).
In addition, Zinc chelate supplementation resulted in significantly greater hoof horn Zn content than did Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05). At the "low" supplementation rate Zinc chelate achieved better hoof quality than Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05). The data suggest that Cu and Zn chelates are more readily absorbed and more easily deposited in key tissues such as hooves, in comparison with inorganic Zn forms.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryan, P. Kearns and T. Quinn (2002) Bioavailability of dietary copper and zinc in adult Texel sheep: A comparative study of the effects of sulfate and Bioplex supplementation.

In weaned piglets evaluated various supplementation rates of organic Zn in the form of a chelate or as a polysaccharide complex and compared these with ZnO, zinc oxide, at 2,000 ppm. Feeding lower concentrations of organic Zn greatly decreased the amount of Zn excreted in comparison with inorganic Zn, without loss of growth performance.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Carlson, C.A.

Studied a Copper chelate in weaned pigs in comparison with inorganic Cu and sulfate. Piglet performance was consistently better with organic Cu at 50 to 100 ppm, in comparison with inorganic Cu at 250 ppm. In addition, organic Cu increased Cu absorption and retention, and decreased Cu excretion 77% and 61% respectively, compared with 250 ppm inorganic Cu.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Veum, M.S. Carlson, C.W.

[[File:Hořčík2.PNG|thumb|200px|Magnesium sample]]
The effects of an Mg chelate in broiler chickens in comparison with [[magnesium oxide]] and an unsupplemented control group. Diets for fattening [[chicken]] are not normally supplemented with Mg, but this study indicated positive effects on performance and meat quality. During the first 3 weeks of life, the Mg chelate improved feed efficiency significantly in comparison with both the inorganic MgO and the negative control group (p&lt;0.05). Thigh meat pH and oxidative deterioration during storage were also studied. The Mg chelate increased thigh meat pH in comparison with the negative control (p&lt;0.05). Mg supplementation significantly reduced chemical indicators ([[TBARS]]) of oxidative deterioration in [[liver]] and thigh [[muscle]] (p&lt;0.01), with Mg chelate significantly more efficient than MgO (p&lt;0.01). The data suggest that organic Mg in the form of a chelate is capable of reducing [[oxidation]], and so improve chicken meat quality.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Guo,Zhang,Yuan and W. Nie.et al.,2003,Effects of source and level of magnesium and Vitamin E on prevention of hepatic peroxidation and oxidative deterioration of broiler meat., Sci.Tech.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Zn chelate supplement was compared with Zn sulfate in broiler chickens.Weight gain and feed intake increased quadratically (p&lt;0.05) with increasing Zn concentrations from the chelate and linearly with Zn sulfate. The relative bioavailability of the Zn chelate was 183% and 157% of Zn sulfate for weight gain and [[tibia]] Zn, respectively. The authors concluded that the supplemental concentration of Zn required in corn-soy diets for broilers from 1–21 days of age would be 9.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg diet as Zn chelate and 20.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg diet as Zn sulfate,respectively.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Sci&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of replacing inorganic minerals with organic minerals in broiler chickens. One group of chickens received inorganic sulfates of Cu (12 ppm), Fe (45 ppm), Mn (70 ppm) and Zn (37 ppm) and their performance was compared to a similar group supplemented with chelates of Cu (2.5 ppm), Fe, Mn, and Zn (all at 10 ppm). 
There were no differences in performance between the birds fed the high inorganic minerals and the birds fed the low organic chelates. Faecal concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were 55%, 73%, 46% and 63%, respectively, of control birds fed inorganic minerals.&lt;ref&gt;quote by Nollet et al.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A broiler study reported  also compared inorganic and organic mineral supplementation in broiler chickens. Control birds were fed Cu, Fe, Mn Se and Zn in inorganic forms (15 ppm Cu 15 from sulfate; 60 ppm Fe from sulfate etc.),and compared with three treatment groups supplemented with organic forms. Apart from improved feathering, most likely associated with the presence of organic Se, there were no significant performance differences between birds fed inorganic and organic minerals. The authors concluded that the use of organic trace minerals permits a reduction of at least 33% in supplement rates in comparison with inorganic minerals, without compromising performance.&lt;ref&gt;by Peric et al.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronic care management''' encompasses the oversight and education activities conducted by [[health care provider|health care professionals]] to help patients with [[chronic diseases]] and health conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[sleep apnea]] learn to understand their condition and live successfully with it. This term is equivalent to [[disease management (health)|disease management]] for chronic conditions. The work involves motivating patients to [[Compliance (medicine)|persist in necessary therapies]] and interventions and helping them to achieve an ongoing, reasonable quality of life.

== Chronic care and the medical system ==

Historically, there has been little coordination across the multiple settings, providers and treatments of chronic illness care. In addition, the treatments for chronic diseases are often complicated, making it difficult for patients to comply with treatment protocols. 

Effective medical care usually requires longer visits to the doctor's office than is common in acute care. Moreover, in treating chronic illnesses, the same intervention, whether medical or behavioral, may differ in effectiveness depending on when in the course of the illness the intervention is suggested. Fragmentation of care is a risk for patients with chronic diseases, because frequently multiple chronic diseases coexist. Necessary interventions can require input from multiple specialists that may not usually work together, and to be effective, they require close, careful coordination.

As a consequence, patients with chronic conditions can fare poorly in the current acute-care model of care delivery.

Historically, reimbursement has been challenging for care coordination services.  Medicare recently started paying for services related to chronic care management. Medicare pays a monthly fee for patients who consent to treatment for a minimum of 20 minutes of [[telehealth]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/ChronicCareManagement.pdf|title=Chronic Care Management Services|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal chronic care management ==

Patients with chronic conditions have an important role in the management of their conditions, as they are often the ones administering the treatments in everyday life. They also play an important role in monitoring their health and changes in their health by means of [[Observations of Daily Living]] (ODLs).&lt;ref name="RWJFe-primer3"&gt;[http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf Health in Everyday Living] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522145954/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf |date=2016-05-22 }} Robert Wood Johnson Foundation primer&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting information may inform both [[self care]] and clinical care.

== Importance ==

Certain problems related to chronic illness are not specifically medical, but involve patients' interactions with families and workplaces. Interventions often require patients and families to make difficult lifestyle changes. Patients need to be educated on the benefits of treatment and the risks of not properly following their treatment regimen. They need to be motivated to comply because treatment usually produces an improved state, rather than the results that most patients desire—a cure. Chronic care management helps patients systematically monitor their progress and coordinate with experts to identify and solve any problems they encounter in their treatment.

It would appear from the above, that chronically ill persons are better cared for by primary care physicians. Considering the diverse nature of chronic health problems and the roles that psychosocial environments play in their course, a purely biological model of care is usually inadequate. The biopsychosocial model of care is the ideal alternative.

== History ==

Although acute care has characterized all medical care until recently, several varieties of managed care have emerged in the past decades in an effort to improve care, reduce unnecessary service utilization and control spiraling costs. Despite its initial promise, however, managed care has not achieved truly coordinated care. In actual operation it appears to emphasize its fiscal goals. Moreover, managed care does not address the complexity of chronic conditions, and in the interests of cost-cutting, tends to reduce time with patients rather than increase it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ware NC, Lachicotte WS, Kirschner SR, Cortes DE, Good BJ |title=Clinician experiences of managed mental health care: a rereading of the threat |journal=Med Anthropol Q |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=3–27 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10812561 |doi=10.1525/maq.2000.14.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronic care models ==

In the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to develop care models for the assessment and treatment of the chronically ill.

Nurse researchers, such as S. Wellard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wellard S |title=Constructions of chronic illness |journal=Int J Nurs Stud |volume=35 |issue=1–2 |pages=49–55 |year=1998 |pmid=9695010 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7489(98)00013-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C. S. Burckhardt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burckhardt CS |title=Coping strategies of the chronically ill |journal=Nurs. Clin. North Am. |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=543–50 |date=September 1987 |pmid=3649790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C. Baker and P. N. Stern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker C, Stern PN |title=Finding meaning in chronic illness as the key to self-care |journal=Can J Nurs Res |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=23–36 |year=1993 |pmid=8118760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and I. M. Lubkin and P. D. Larson,&lt;ref&gt;Lubkin, I.M. and Larson, P.D. (2002). ''Chronic illness: Impact and interventions'' (5th ed.) Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.&lt;/ref&gt; were often on the front lines of actual care for patients with ongoing treatments for conditions such as diabetes or renal failure. They stated that their patients experienced a series of "phases", and that during some of these phases the patients responded to the same interventions quite differently.

Individuals who suffered from chronic illnesses, such as C. Register&lt;ref&gt;Register, C. (1987). ''The Chronic Illness Experience: Embracing the Imperfect Life''. Center City MN: Hazelton.&lt;/ref&gt; and S. Wells,&lt;ref&gt;Wells, S.M. (1988).'' A Delicate Balance: Living Successfully With Chronic Illness''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have given detailed accounts of their experiences and made recommendations about how to manage chronic conditions. Associations proliferated for those with specific conditions ([[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], etc.), and these groups have engaged in advocacy work, acted as clearinghouses for information, and began funding research.

Edward H. Wagner, M.D., Director of The MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation, Director of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation national program "Improving Chronic Illness Care", and Senior Investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, WA developed the [http://www.improvingchroniccare.org Chronic Care Model], or CCM.  The CCM  summarizes the basic elements for improving care in health systems on different levels.  These elements are the community, the health system, self-management support, delivery system design, decision support and clinical information systems. Evidence-based change concepts under each element, in combination, foster productive interactions between informed patients who take an active part in their care and providers with resources and expertise. The Chronic Care Model can be applied to a variety of chronic illnesses, health care settings and target populations. The bottom line is healthier patients, more satisfied providers, and cost savings.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wagner EH |title=Chronic disease management: what will it take to improve care for chronic illness? |journal=Eff Clin Pract |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=2–4 |year=1998 |pmid=10345255 |url=http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/augsep98/cdm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/programs/ Stanford Self-Management Program] is a community-based self-management program that helps people with chronic illness gain self-confidence in their ability to control their symptoms and manage how their health problems will affect their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lorig KR, Sobel DS, Stewart AL |title=Evidence suggesting that a chronic disease self-management program can improve health status while reducing hospitalization: a randomized trial |journal=[[Medical Care (journal)|Medical Care]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10413387 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0025-7079&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5 |doi=10.1097/00005650-199901000-00003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. O. Prochaska and his colleagues, investigating issues associated with the treatment of addictions, have described a [[transtheoretical model]] of behavior change as a process rather than an event. They have advocated assessment and treatment based on the patient’s stage in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prochaska JO, DiClemente CC, Norcross JC |title=In search of how people change.

[[Patricia Fennell]], working on the experiences of imposed change (such as illness, grief, or trauma), has developed the Fennell Four Phase Model of chronic illness. Fennell says people commonly experience four phases as they learn to incorporate their changed physical abilities or psychological outlook into their personality and lifestyle: Crisis, Stabilization, Integration, and Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennell, P.A. |title=Managing Chronic Illness: The Four Phase Approach |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2003 |url=http://www.albanyhealthmanagement.com/books/mcibook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennell, P.A. |title=The Chronic Illness Workbook: Strategies and Solutions for Taking Back Your Life |publisher=Spring Harbor Press |location=Delmar NY |year=2006 |edition=2nd |url=http://chronicillnessworkbook.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established by the investment banking firm Wyatt Matas, the term Care Cycle Management is a chronic care business model that integrates interventional disease management with care delivery to manage the care of high-cost patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyattmatas.com/thought-center/posts?tag=care-cycle-management |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630170227/http://www.wyattmatas.com/thought-center/posts?tag=care-cycle-management |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flinders Human Behaviour &amp; Health Research Unit (based in Adelaide, South Australia) has developed the [http://www.flinders.edu.au/medicine/sites/fhbhru/self-management.cfm Flinders ProgramTM], a generic set of tools and processes that allows for assessment of chronic condition management behaviours, collaborative identification of problems and goal setting leading to the development of individualised care plans with the goal of raising the quality of life for people living with chronic disease.

There are multiple [[models of deafness]]; Deaf mental health focuses on a cultural model in that people who are deaf view themselves as part of a socio-cultural linguistic community, rather than people with a medical deficit or disability. Accordingly, providing deaf mental heath care to people of the Deaf community requires services from clinicians, doctors, and interpreters who are trained with this perspective and the inclusion of deaf professionals in this system of health care. 

==Deaf children language development==
Early access to language in deaf children is important for normal development of language. Deprivation of language can negatively affect mental health and in severe cases can cause mental health syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|last2=Levin|first2=Leonard L.|last3=Anderson|first3=Melissa L.|date=2017|title=Language Deprivation Syndrome: A Possible Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Sociocultural Origins|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5469702/|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|volume=52|issue=6|pages=761–776|doi=10.1007/s00127-017-1351-7|issn=0933-7954|pmc=5469702|pmid=28204923|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to auditory and visual language is important, and availability differs based on each child's abilities. Approximately 40% of deaf children also have additional disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dijk|first=Jan van|last2=Nelson|first2=Catherine|last3=Postma|first3=Albert|last4=Dijk|first4=Rick van|date=2010-06-28|title=Deaf Children with Severe Multiple Disabilities|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education, Vol. 2|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195390032.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195390032-e-012|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195390032.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195390032-e-012|doi-broken-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states have deaf schools and institutions that provide appropriate language models along with mental health services for their students and those in the surrounding Deaf communities. The [[Lexington School for the Deaf]] in [[Queens, New York]] provides a variety of educational and social services for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexnyc.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=350012&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=759819|title=Mission Statements &amp; Basic Tenets – About Us – Lexington School &amp; Center for the Deaf|website=www.lexnyc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas School for the Deaf]] in Austin, Texas also provides a focus on mental health for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://texasdeafed.org/topics/mental-health-for-deaf-youth|title=Texas Initiative for Mental Health for Deaf Youth {{!}} Crossroads|website=texasdeafed.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf children in mainstream schools may be more neglected in the classroom than their hearing peers. It is also more common for deaf children to have a harder time making friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nunes|first=Terezinha|last2=Pretzlik|first2=Ursula|last3=Olsson|first3=Jenny|date=2001|title=Deaf children's social relationships in mainstream schools|url=|journal=Deafness &amp; Education International|volume=3|issue=3|pages=123–136|doi=10.1179/146431501790560972|issn=1464-3154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can occur frequently among children who are deaf or hard of hearing, which can lead to negative mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akram|first=B|last2=Nawaz|first2=J|last3=Rafi|first3=J|last4=Akram|first4=A|date=2018|title=Social exclusion, mental health and suicidal ideation among adults with hearing loss: protective and risk factors|url=http://www.jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/8601.pdf|journal=Development|volume=2|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and access==
For a deaf person, obtaining access to proper medical treatment is challenging and they face a variety of obstacles in communication and access. This can include the way in which medical professionals initiate patient's various health exams without prior modification suitable for deaf individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-17|title=Mental health of deaf people|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673611611434|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=379|issue=9820|pages=1037–1044|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61143-4|pmid=22423884|issn=0140-6736|last1=Fellinger|first1=Johannes|last2=Holzinger|first2=Daniel|last3=Pollard|first3=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication challenges and lack of doctor awareness of the culture and language of the deaf can lead deaf patients to avoid making medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=90f07d82-8f9d-472a-9f7b-99a4de8ee092@sdc-v-sessmgr06|title=Primary care for deaf people with mental health problems|last=Levine|first=Jack|date=May 8, 2014|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the amount of professionals who are trained in [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and have experience with [[Deaf culture]] increase positive mental health outcomes for deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=d2f28c89-6f6a-4fbb-aabb-9f6ae4875e4c@sessionmgr4008|title=Mental Health Services for People Who Are Deaf|last=Vernon|first=McCay|last2=Leigh|first2=Irene|date=2007|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=d2f28c89-6f6a-4fbb-aabb-9f6ae4875e4c@sessionmgr4008|title=Individuals with Hearing Loss in Arkansas and Mental Health Service: Evaluating Accessibility.|last=Pettis|first=Christy Linn|date=2014|website=eds-a-ebscohost-com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and deafness==
Age-related hearing loss gradually occurs in many people as they get older, typically affecting those over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss|title=Age-Related Hearing Loss|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of hearing loss can lead to feelings of embarrassment and isolation due to the fact that those affected may no longer be able to hear family, friends, or simple everyday sounds. Those with hearing loss are less likely to want to engage in social activities due to frustration over not being able to hear. A study conducted by the National Council of Aging (NCOA) showed that a large portion of elders with hearing loss who were studied, reported symptoms of lasting depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/52532-How-hearing-loss-can-impact-mental-health#about-author-lisa-packer|title=How hearing loss can impact mental health|date=2015-09-17|work=Healthy Hearing|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of exclusion from social and employment opportunities due to higher rates of miscommunication, making deaf adults more susceptible to mental illnesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Studies have found that when a person becomes deaf at an older age, it has a less extreme impact on their mental health than it does when hearing loss begins at an earlier age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tambs|first=Kristian|date=September-October 2004|title=Moderate Effects of Hearing Loss on Mental Health and Subjective Well-Being: Results From the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study|url=|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=66|issue=5|pages=776–782|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those who were either born deaf or lost their hearing at a younger age and then age as a deaf person face some particularly difficult challenges. When a non-deaf person ages, isolationist tendencies are generally increased. This increase is even more drastic for deaf people. Furthermore, many technological advancements that are heavily dependent on auditory communication also present challenges to deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Sherry|last2=Roberson|first2=Len|date=October 2013|title=Social Connectedness of Deaf Retirees|url=|journal=Educational Gerontology|volume=39|pages=750–760|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge of professionals==
The type and onset of deafness may cause different types of language disfluencies, diagnoses, and treatments of clients who are deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crump|first=Charlene|last2=Hamerdinger|first2=Stephen|date=2017|title=Understanding Etiology of Hearing Loss as a Contributor to Language Dysfluency and its Impact on Assessment and Treatment of People who are Deaf in Mental Health Settings|journal=Community Mental Health Journal|volume=53|issue=8|pages=922–928|doi=10.1007/s10597-017-0120-0|pmid=28229314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural knowledge, language skills (e.g., fluency in ASL or access to trained interpreters), and other social-cultural factors are part of the deaf mental health access model. Lack of knowledge about Deaf culture and sign language among mental health professionals can make it difficult for deaf people to access appropriate services.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

==ASL interpreting and training for mental health==
[[File:Sign language interpreter.jpg|thumb|Sign language interpreter]]
The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has eight recommendations for qualifications of interpreters working in mental health settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nad.org/issues/health-care/mental-health-services/position-statement-mental-health-interpreting-services-peo | title=Position Statement on Mental Health Interpreting Services with People who are Deaf| date=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Fluency in American Sign Language
# Fluency in English and register choices
# Culturally competent
# Attending a comprehensive training curriculum for mental health interpreting
# Mentoring with experienced mental health interpreters (at least 50 hours)
# Individual or group supervision and peer consultation
# High standards of ethical practice
# Knowledge of relevant ethical literature or decision-making models in interpreting

Specific knowledge and training in mental health contexts is necessary for adequate sign language interpreting for mental health clients. Accordingly, the State of Alabama requires "Certification of mental health interpreters for persons who are deaf" for interpreters to work in mental health contexts, and this certification must be renewed yearly by either: a) working 40 hours in clinical settings; b) attending 40 hours of training; or c) a combination of work in clinical settings and training equaling 40 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.neo.registeredsite.com/2/1/4/12973412/assets/580-3-24.pdf|title=Chapter 580-3-24 Certification of Mental Health Interpreters for Persons who are Deaf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide the opportunity for education and training, the Alabama Department of Mental Health's Office of Deaf Services established the Alabama's Mental Health Interpreter Training Project.

A '''dry enema''' is an alternative technique for cleansing the human [[rectum]] either for reasons of health, or for sexual hygiene.  It is accomplished by squirting a small amount of sterile [[lubricant]] into the rectum, resulting in a [[bowel movement]] more quickly and with less violence than can be achieved by an oral [[laxative]].

It is called "dry" by contrast to the more usual [[enema|wet enema]], because no water is used.

==Techniques==

===Suppositories===
A rudimentary form of "dry" enema is the use of a non-medicated [[glycerin]] suppository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glycerin Suppository|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/GuidetoCancerDrugs/glycerin-suppository|work=American Cancer Society|publisher=American Cancer Society, Inc|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, due to the relative hardiness of the [[suppository]] - necessary for its insertion into the human body - before the glycerin can act, it must be melted by the heat of the body, and hence it does not take effect for up to an hour. Often the [[hygroscopic]] glycerin irritates the sensitive [[Mucous membrane|membranes]] of the rectum resulting in forceful expulsion of the suppository without any [[laxative]] effects.

[[Image:Syringe.jpg|thumb|329px|A disposable syringe]]

===Lubrication injection===
A quicker form of the dry enema utilizes the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of a small amount of water-based [[lubricant]] such as [[KY Jelly]] into the rectum via a non-hypodermic [[syringe]], such as an oral syringe, or from some other source.  Then again since the glycerin itself is an effective producer of the desired [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the colonic muscles it is simpler - and more easily controlled - to introduce 5 - 10 cc of glycerin directly into the rectum.  Specialist syringes are available for this purpose but are hard to find.  An alternative is to use an enema [[nozzle]] which has an intake end which is compatible with a standard [[Syringe|hypodermic syringe]].  This allows the immediate [[Intraperitoneal injection|injection]] of the 5-10 ccs. required, and results can  be expected in 2–4 minutes.  Another alternative is to use a normal 5 or 10cc syringe inserted directly into the anus.  This needs to be done carefully to avoid scratching the anal passage.  The passage should be lubricated with [[sorbolene]] cream or any water-based lubricant.  Only a syringe with a Luer-slip should be used, not a [[Luer taper|Luer-lock tip]] (a syringe end molded to take a screw-on needle).  Penetration is better performed by the patient to eliminate any pain.  The patient should be encouraged to wait at least 15 minutes in order that [[peristalsis]] can reach the full length of the rectum, but many will find this impossible and this treatment should therefore be applied only when the facilities to evacuate are nearby.

The usual amount of lubricant applied is about 2 tsp (10 cc), which will produce a [[Defecation|movement]] in 30 minutes or less. The movement will be produced in a compact body, rather than in the more copious liquid form produced by a wet enema; and since no water is used, none will be retained higher up in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], to be expelled at a later, and possibly inconvenient, time.

A further advantage of this technique for [[sexual hygiene]] is that any slight remaining traces of [[Feces|fecal material]] will - due to the presence of the lubricant - tend to adhere to the wall of the [[rectum]] rather than to any foreign object which may subsequently be inserted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The '''estimated date of delivery''' '''(EDD)''', also known as '''expected date of confinement'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/ConciseGuide/06.pdf A Concise Guide to the Employment Ordinance]. Labour Department, Hong Kong Government&lt;/ref&gt;, and '''estimated due date''' or simply '''due date''', is a term describing the estimated delivery date for a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] [[woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3333|title=Definition of Estimated date of confinement (EDC)|publisher=MedicineNet, Inc.|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal pregnancies last between 37 and 42 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transitiontoparenthood.com/ttp/parented/pregnancy/duedate.htm|title=How accurate is your Due Date?|last=Durham|first=Janelle|year=2004|publisher=www.transitiontoparenthood.com|accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==
[[wikt:confinement|Confinement]] is a traditional term referring to the period of pregnancy when an upper-class, noble, or royal woman would withdraw from society in medieval and tudor times be confined to their rooms with midwives, ladies-in-waiting and female family members only to attend them.&lt;ref name=" Tudor Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tudorsociety.com/childbirth-in-medieval-and-tudor-times-by-sarah-bryson/|title=Childbirth in Medieval and Tudor Times|publisher=The Tudor Society|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was believed to calm the mother and reduce the risk of premature delivery. Except in threatened pregnancies (for example, in [[pre-eclampsia]]), "lying-in" or bedrest is no longer a part of [[antenatal]] care.

==Estimation methods==
Due date estimation basically follows two steps:
*Determination of which time point is to be used as the origin for [[gestational age]]. This starting point is the woman's last normal [[menstrual period]] (LMP) or the corresponding time as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Such methods include adding 14 days to a known duration since [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] (as is possible in [[in vitro fertilization]]) or by [[obstetric ultrasonography]].
*Adding the estimated gestational age at childbirth to the above time point.

===Estimation of gestational age at childbirth===
Childbirth on average occurs at a gestational age of 280 days (40 weeks), which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Healthline"/&gt; However, alternative durations as well as more individualized methods have also been suggested. There is in any case considerable variation among individual pregnancies.

====Variability====
[[File:Distribution of gestational age at childbirth.jpg|thumb|280px|Distribution of gestational age at childbirth among singleton live births, given both when [[gestational age]] is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and directly by last menstrual period. About 80% of childbirths occur between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age, with a somewhat more narrow span when based on first trimester ultrasound.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Caroline S.|last2=Messer|first2=Lynne C.|last3=Mendola|first3=Pauline|last4=Savitz|first4=David A.|last5=Herring|first5=Amy H.|author5-link=Amy H. Herring|last6=Hartmann|first6=Katherine E.|title=Comparison of gestational age at birth based on last menstrual period and ultrasound during the first trimester|journal=Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology|volume=22|issue=6|year=2008|pages=587–596|issn=02695022|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3016.2008.00965.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Given that these gestation lengths are only estimates of an average, it is helpful to consider gestation time as a range of dates rather than as a single "due date". The median is merely a guideline for the day at which half of all births occur earlier, and half of all births occur later. Births rarely occur ''on'' a due date, but they are clustered ''around'' due dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{eMedicine|med|3236|Evaluation of Gestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of singleton live births in the US came to the result that childbirth has a [[standard deviation]] of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester ultrasound, and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008/&gt;

====Standard 280 days====
=====Naegele's rule=====
''Naegele's rule'' is a standard way of calculating the due date for a [[pregnancy]] when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. The result is approximately 280 days (40 weeks) from the start of the last menstrual period. Another method is by adding 9 months and 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period.

Naegele's rule is named after [[Franz Naegele|Franz Karl Naegele]] (1778–1851), the German obstetrician who devised the rule. Naegele was born July 12, 1778, in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1806, Naegele became ordinary professor and director of the lying-in hospital in Heidelberg. His ''Lehrbuch der Geburtshilfe'', published in 1830 for midwives, enjoyed a successful 14 editions.

''Example:''&lt;br&gt;
LMP = 8 May 2009
:+1 year = 8 May 2010
:−3 months = 8 February 2010
:+7 days = 15 February 2010

280 days past the start of the last menstrual period is found by checking the day of the week of the LMP and adjusting the calculated date to land on the same day of the week. Using the example above, 8 May 2009 is a Friday. The calculated date (15 February) is a Monday; adjusting to the closest Friday produces 12 February, which is exactly 280 days past 8 May. The calculation method does not always result in 280 days because not all calendar months are the same length; it does not account for leap years.

=====Mobile apps=====
[[Mobile app]]s essentially always give consistent estimations compared to each other and correct for [[leap year]], while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year.&lt;ref name="pmid24036402"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chambliss LR, Clark SL | title = Paper gestational age wheels are generally inaccurate | journal = Am.

====Other suggested durations====
*'''276 days''' for both ultrasound-estimated and LMP-estimated gestational age in a US study of 1867 singleton live births.&lt;ref name=hoffman2008/&gt;
* '''281 days''' after LMP with a [[standard deviation]] of 13 days, was the result of a population-based study of 427,581 singleton births in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bergsjø P, Denman DW 3rd, Hoffman HJ, Meirik O. |title=Duration of human singleton pregnancy.

* '''281 days''' after LMP for first-time mothers and '''280 days''' for all others were the medians found by a 1995 American study of 1,970 spontaneous births. Standard deviation was 7–9 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gray, H|title=Duration of pregnancy. |journal=Stanford Medical Bulletin |pages=24–8|volume=20 |year=1962 |pmid=13901307 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H.

* A median of '''288 days''' (274 days from the date of ovulation) for first-time mothers and '''283 days''' (269 days from the date of ovulation) for mothers with at least one previous pregnancy was found by a 1990 study of 114 white, private-care patients with uncomplicated pregnancies and spontaneous labor. The authors suggest that excluding pregnancies involving complications (that often lead to pre-term deliveries) accounts for the longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mittendorf R, Williams MA, Berkey CS, Cotter PF |title=The length of uncomplicated human gestation.|journal=Obstet Gynecol|pages=929–32|volume=75|issue=5 |year=1990|pmid=2342739|url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/toc/1990/06000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individualized====
*'''Parikh's formula''' is a calculation method that considers cycle duration. Naegele's rule assumes an average cycle length of 28 days, which is not true for everyone. EDD is calculated using Parikh's formula by adding nine months to the start of the last menstrual period, subtracting 21 days, and then adding duration of previous cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rakesh M. Parikh|title=Parikh’s formula to minimize errors in calculating expected date of delivery |journal=Medical Hypotheses|pages=928|volume=68|issue=4 |year=2007 |url=http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/issues/contents?issue_key=S0306-9877%2807%29X0362-1 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Multiple linear regression]] models have also been developed that account for maternal [[Parity (biology)|parity]], age, and race, all which have been found to be important variables determining the length of human gestation. Multiparous women, women aged less than 19 or more than 34 years, and black women have been found to have shorter gestations than primiparous women, women aged 19 to 34 years, or white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mittendorf R, Williams MA, Berkey CS, Lieberman E, Monson RR |title=Predictors of human gestational length |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=168 |issue=2 |pages=480–484 |year=1993 |pmid=8438913 |doi=10.1016/0002-9378(93)90476-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Fee splitting''' is the practice of sharing fees with professional colleagues, such as physicians or lawyers, in return for being sent referrals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/fee-splitting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fee splitting in medicine and healthcare==

This is essentially the payment of a commission to the referrer with the express intention of ensuring that the referring doctor directs referrals of patients to the payee.

In most parts of the world, the practice is considered unethical and unacceptable, hence fee splitting is often covert.  The reason it is believed not to be in the interests of patients is because it represents a [[conflict of interest]] which may adversely affect patient care and well-being, since patients will not necessarily be referred to the most appropriate doctor to provide their on-going care but will instead be referred to those doctors or hospitals with whom the referring doctor has a "fee splitting" or commission payment type of arrangement.
It is also called as 'CUT' (also spoken as Cee-You-Tee) practice in many parts of the world including [[India]] for its reference to a 'cut' from the patients bill.

Many countries do not allow promotion of health services via mass media, advertisements and other direct promotions, and in a significant way, information on pricing and quality of care institutions and medicines reaches to patient through their primary care physician, many of whom indulge in a referral fee split unethical practice to refer a patient for business to a higher specialist, brand prescription and admissions.

==Fee splitting in the United States==

The situation in the US is not entirely clear &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771534-2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Medical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wma.net/e/meetings/leaders1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[American Medical Association|AMA]] Code provides that payment by or to a physician solely for the referral of a patient is unethical as is the acceptance by a physician of payment of any kind, and in any form, from any source such as a pharmaceutical company or pharmacist or a manufacturer of medical appliances and devices, for referring a patient to that source. Another section specifies that clinics, laboratories, hospitals or other health care facilities which compensate physicians for referral of patients are engaged in fee-splitting, which is unethical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among its ''Definitions of Unprofessional Conduct'', the "West Hudson Psychiatric Society Virtual Newsletter" (1997) lists ''Offering, giving or receiving a fee for the referral of a patient (fee splitting), or permitting any person other than an employee or associate to share in your fee, who has not provided an appropriate service directly under your supervision''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfmh.org/whps/syn1197.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice, or something resembling it, tends to be tolerated - in ''"Medicine, Money, and Morals: Physicians' Conflicts of Interest"'' by Marc A. Rodwin, forms of fee splitting and commission paying for referrals remain common in the USA and are in effect tolerated by key overseeing bodies such as the [[American Medical Association]] and [[Joint Commission International]], or JCI.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUKs1ovVmYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=joint+commission+fee+splitting&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_CyAWz_4xn&amp;sig=ZUZNhoBXpAUjybvjXYn5ZZ-wchI&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their website, the [[Joint Commission]] (JCI) have no published view on the issue of fee splitting, and in fact the Joint Commission stopped trying to provide guidance on [[medical ethics]] to American hospitals many years ago,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUKs1ovVmYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=joint+commission+fee+splitting&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_CyAWz_4xn&amp;sig=ZUZNhoBXpAUjybvjXYn5ZZ-wchI&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to concentrate on less challenging areas of healthcare assessment, despite the vast importance of [[medical ethics]] to [[patient safety]].  It is not clear if JCI operate to a similar level of standards when working outside of the USA.

The popular group marketing website groupon and other daily deal businesses have received the green light from some U.S. state bar associations, most notably [[North Carolina's State Bar]] formal opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbar.com/ethics/ethics.asp?page=14&amp;from=1/2011&amp;to=12/2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, approved in some jurisdictions, Alabama and other state bar associations have chosen to dissent &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alabar.org/ogc/PDF/2012-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; from the NC state bar ruling, and have formally ruled in opposition to allowing daily deal websites as an ethical form of group marketing. Some state bar associations have yet to formally choose an opinion.

==Fee splitting in the United Kingdom==

Fee splitting and similar practices are considered unequivocally unacceptable for the medical profession in the United Kingdom.

The practice is considered unethical, and offenders can be disciplined and even "struck off the medical register" (that is, lose their license to practice medicine).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/archive/func_proced_and_dis_jan_1970.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that it does not happen.

==Fee splitting in other countries==

Fee splitting in the medical profession of various sorts has been alleged in [[Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/midweek/2007/11/14/n2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sma.org.sg/3903/Forum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bumrungraddeath.com/pages/news_details.cfm?id=112&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/326/7379/10/c&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Femalia''''' is a book of 32 full-color photographs of human [[vulva]]s, edited by [[Joani Blank]] and first published by [[Down There Press]] in 1993.{{r|Femalia-1993}} A [[reprint]] [[Edition (book)|edition]] was published by [[Last Gasp]] in 2011.{{r|Femalia-2011}} The photographs were taken by [[Tee Corinne]], Michael Perry, [[Jill Posener]], and Michael A. Rosen. The photographs are presented without commentary, except for Blank's brief introduction to the volume as a whole.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

== History ==

The word used as the book's title, ''[[Wiktionary:femalia|femalia]]'', was taken from the novel ''[[Vox (Nicholson Baker novel)|Vox]]'' by [[Nicholson Baker]].{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Baker-1992|p=143}} The photographs by Corinne and Perry had been taken years before the book's original publication in 1993; those by Posener and Rosen were taken specifically for inclusion in the first edition of ''Femalia''.{{r|Femalia-1993}}

''Femalia'' grew out of Blank's long-term work as a feminist sex educator. She felt that medical and pornographic images of the female genitals were inadequate to her purposes.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}} In her introduction to the first edition, Blank lamented the absence of readily available photographic representations of the vulva other than heavily edited images in male-oriented pornography, and the resulting feeling on the part of a majority of women that "in one way or another, their genitals are not quite ‘normal’".{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}}

== Feminist response ==

Feminist authors have sharply contrasted the portrayals of vulvas in ''Femalia'' with those in typical male-oriented [[pornography]] and in biomedical sources.{{r|Duncan-2005}} ''Femalia'''s portrayals are characterized as accurate, honest, open, and truthful, as exhibiting "stark reality";{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,362}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}} as promoting a positive view of the vulva;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015}} as emphasizing the diversity of the vulva in different women,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=166,202,360,379}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}}{{r|Green-2005|p=181}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Kitzinger-2001|p=264}} as well as the diversity of opinions and perspectives about the vulva on the part of both men and women;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}} and as emphasizing female autonomy.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=222}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Wilkinson-2001|p=25}} By contrast, portrayals of the vulva in pornography and in biomedical science are characterized as stylized and uniform, excluding women whose genitalia do not match their models.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,360}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}} Pornographic portrayals are further characterized as commodified,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=202}} and medical portrayals as sterile.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87}} Feminist sex educators have advocated perusal of the images in ''Femalia'' as an exercise to help women to regard their genitals in a more positive light.{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}}{{r|Savage-2014-12-03}}{{r|Warburton-2007|p=69}}

== Civil liberties ==

Librarian [[Sanford Berman]] has cited ''Femalia'' as an example to illustrate his thesis that libraries engage in inappropriate [[self-censorship]], often motivated by concerns about controversial sexual content, in deciding which books to stock.{{r|Berman-2000-04-16}}{{r|Berman-2001}} Berman comments, "A detailed, artistic picture of a seashell adorns the cover. Were the contents strictly shell photos, the book might make it into at least some libraries. Shells, yes. Vulvas, no."{{r|Berman-2001|p=51}}

== Science and medicine ==

=== Research on depiction and perception of female genitals ===

In a study of systematic differences in the depiction of female genitals in online pornography, anatomy textbooks, and feminist publications, ''Femalia'' was used as one of three sources of sample depictions in the feminist-publications category.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=76}} This study found a statistically significant difference between online pornography and feminist publications in depicted protuberance of the [[labia minora]], with greater mean protuberance shown in the feminist publications.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77}} It also found greater variation in measured genital proportions shown in the feminist publications than in the other two categories of sources.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77–78}}

''Femalia'' was used as one of two sources of sample depictions of female genitals (the other was [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']]) in a psychological study of the relationship between women's aesthetic perceptions of female genitals and their attitudes toward [[Gynaecology|gynecological]] examinations.{{r|Schick-2010|p=21}} More specifically, the examinations in question were [[Pap test|Pap smears]], and the relevant attitudes were anxiety, embarrassment, and likelihood of making or keeping an appointment for a [[Pap test|Pap smear]].{{r|Schick-2010|p=22–24}}

=== Educational role in clinical practice ===

The [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]] (RACGP) has published a guideline document, authored by Dr. Magdalena Simonis under authority of the RACGP, intended to inform healthcare professionals about female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS), such as [[labiaplasty]], and to advise them about management of patient requests for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07}} In this document, Dr. Simonis identifies lack of appreciation of female genital diversity, not only on the part of the public but also on the part of healthcare professionals, as a contributing factor to the demand for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=2–6}} She advocates the use of ''Femalia'' as a tool for patient education about genital diversity,{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9,13}} in part because it depicts female genitals without digital enhancement.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9}} Dr. Simonis has further referenced this educational use of ''Femalia'' in slide and poster presentations intended to promote better management of the demand for FGCS on the part of healthcare professionals.{{r|Simonis-2015-09-23}}{{r|Simonis-2015-09-13-16}}

Medical anthropologist Eric Plemons has stated that:
:The feminist commitment to ostensibly unmediated representation of ‘natural’ female genitals is one whose value has also been recognized by medical experts; ''Femalia'' has had an unanticipated life in clinical literature.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}
Plemons documents the use of ''Femalia'' as a resource to demonstrate the existence of female genital diversity, and to educate both clinicians and patients as to the range of normal vulval appearance. He attributes its widespread use by healthcare professionals to their belief that "it is one of very few photographic collections of ‘normal’ vulvas that exists".{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

=== Transsexual genital cosmesis ===

''Femalia'' has been used as a way of assessing preferences for [[Perineum|perineal]] and genital cosmetic appearance, to improve [[cosmesis]] in male-to-female [[transsexual]]s ([[Trans woman|transwomen]]) undergoing genital [[sex reassignment surgery]] (GSRS).{{r|Plemons-2015}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Beginning in the year 2000, surgeon Neal Wilson began showing photographs from ''Femalia'' to his prospective GSRS patients and asking them to indicate which vulvas they found most aesthetically pleasing, as well as which ones they would choose for themselves. Dr. Wilson attempted to approximate through surgery the appearance of the photographs from ''Femalia'' selected by his prospective patients, even though he held that they set "impossible standards" because of the limitations of early 21st-century surgical technique.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=429}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Dr. Wilson has republished, in an online journal article, the three photographs most often selected by his patients. He has also provided summary statistics concerning his patients′ choices of vulval photographs from ''Femalia'', as well as a short narrative summary of the specific anatomical features that he believed to be characteristic of the most popular photographs.{{r|Wilson-2002}}

'''Chile's food labelling and advertising law''', formally titled ''Ley 20.606, sobre la composición de los alimentos y su publicidad'' (“Law 20.606, on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”) establishes a regulatory framework on food security and healthy food with the intention of guiding consumers towards behaviour patterns that promote public health. After the 2012 law was enacted, its accompanying regulations came into full force on June 27, 2016. Andrew Jacobs, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', has characterized this measure as "the world’s most ambitious attempt to remake a country’s food culture" and suggests it "could be a model for how to turn the tide on a global [[obesity]] epidemic that researchers say contributes to four million premature deaths a year."&lt;ref name="nyt-feb2018"&gt;Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/health/obesity-chile-sugar-regulations.html In Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chile]], the law — often referred to by less cumbersome names such as ''ley de etiquetado de alimentos'' (“food labelling law”), ''ley del Súper Ocho'' (“Super Eight law”), or simply ''ley de alimentos'' (“food law”) — specifically regulates the delivery of nutritional information on foods high in [[Health effects of salt|sodium]], [[Saturated fat#Dietary recommendations|saturated fat]]s, [[Sugar#Recommended dietary intake|sugar]]s or [[Food energy#Recommended daily intake|calorie]]s. The standard also prohibits the sale of such foods in educational institutions, and limits the [[Advertising to children|advertising of these products to children]] under fourteen.

==History==
===Background===
According to a 2010 national health survey, more than 60 percent of Chile’s population suffers from excessive weight. The problem begins early in childhood, with more than 10 percent of children under six, more than 15 percent of preschoolers and more than 25 percent of first-grade children presenting with obesity. When the overweight and the obese children are considered as a group, more than 50 percent of them, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health, are found to suffer from malnutrition, which is considered the main public health problem in the country.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"&gt;''[http://web.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Informe-Implementaci%C3%B3n-Ley-20606-junio-2017-PDF.pdf Informe de evaluación de la implementación de la ley sobre composición nutricional de los alimentos y su publicidad]'' (“Evaluation report on the implementation of the law on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”), June 2017, Subsecretaría de Salud Pública, Departamento de Nutrición y Alimentos (Public Health subsecretariat, Department of Nutrition and Food, Ministry of Health, Government of Chile), 97 pp. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and regulations==
===Law 20.606===
The law has eleven articles; its stipulations establish: 

* The responsibility of manufacturers, importers or producers of food for human consumption to have specific labels on the nature of the product, with full and truthful information, and their responsibility to ensure that good practices guaranteeing food safety are followed in their production chain. 

* A duty of manufacturers, producers, distributors and importers of food to inform, on their containers or on their labels, as to the ingredients contained, including all additives and their [[nutritional information]], to follow food health regulations in which the characteristics and content of said food will determine the labelling, and especially to ensure that the information is sufficiently visible and comprehensible.

* A prohibition against [[adulterant|adulterating ingredients and prepared foods]] with anything that in some way may create an erroneous impression regarding their true nature, composition or quality, or that may cause damage to health, as determined by the Ministry of Health.

* A duty of preschool, elementary and secondary schools to include educational materials and exercise in order to promote healthy eating habits and physical activity, and the mandated requirement for the Education and Health ministries to have a nutritional monitoring system for students in preschool, elementary and secondary school.

* The requirement for the Ministry of Health to determine foods whose nutritional composition has high amounts of calories, fats, sugars or salt (or other ingredients, as determined by regulation), setting permitted maximums and ensuring compliance through the public health system.

* A prohibition against commercial sale or distribution in preschool, elementary and secondary schools of food products labelled as high in the regulated nutrients or calories, as well as the free delivery or advertising of such products to children under 14, including commercial tie-ins designed to appeal to children, such as toys, accessories, adhesives or similar products.

* A prohibition against labelling baby formulas and breast-milk substitutes in any way that may discourage [[breastfeeding]].

* An obligation that any food product marketed in Chile that contains among its ingredients — or that has used, in the course of its preparation — soy, milk, [[peanut]]s, eggs, seafood, fish, [[gluten]] or nuts must indicate this on its package or label.

===Regulatory regime===
Health ministry decree No. 13 (April 16, 2015), amended the government's processed foods regulation to adapt it to the provisions of Law 20.606 and specifying maximum calories, sodium, sugars and saturated fats in food; the values were set to diminish by progressive stages after the regulation's entry into force.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"&gt;''[http://www.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/decreto_etiquetado_alimentos_2015.pdf Modifica Decreto Supremo N° 977 de 1996, Reglamento Sanitario de los Alimentos]'' (“Amendment to Supreme Decree No. 977 of 1996, Food Health Regulation.”), ''Diario Oficial de la República de Chile'' (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Chile”). Accessed 4 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The limits stipulated by law are:

The regulation also detailed the foods that are exempted from the labelling obligation, which includes foods without added sugars, honey or syrups; without added sodium and without saturated fats; those sold in bulk or portioned out, divided and prepared at the request of the public (even if they are packaged at the time of sale); [[infant formula]]; commercially prepared minced [[baby food]], unless they contain added sugar; food prepared for medical use; food for [[weight management|weight control regimens]]; [[dietary supplement]]s and certain [[bodybuilding supplement|foods for athletes]]; and table-top [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"/&gt;

==Compliance and impact==
===International impact===
Several countries have expressed interest in the Chilean standards and have considered their content in developing their own countries' labelling regulations, including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Uruguay]].

In addition, international organizations — including the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[Pan American Health Organization]],&lt;ref name="ops"&gt;''[https://www.paho.org/chi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=845:opsoms-celebra-ley-de-alimentos-en-chile-como-ejemplo-para-el-resto-de-los-paises-de-las-americas&amp;Itemid=1005 OPS/OMS celebra Ley de Alimentos en Chile como ejemplo para el resto de los países de Las Américas]'' (“PAHO/WHO celebrates Chile's food law as an example for the rest of the countries of the Americas”), 22 Dec. 2016, Organización Panamericana de Salud. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and [[World Health Organization]], the [[Union of South American Nations]] and the [[OECD]] — have expressed support for the Chilean food labelling and advertising law and regulations and have facilitated bilateral cooperation, [[Memorandum of understanding|memoranda of understanding]] and the establishment of international networks. [[Codex Alimentarius]] has urged member countries to revise regulations on labelling, while the [[World Trade Organization]] has established international discussion panels on food labelling, at which Chile has been a prominent speaker.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"/&gt;

In addition, during [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] negotiations, the governments of Mexico and Canada have advocated for nutritional warnings on foods, inspired by the Chilean experience, but the current [[United States]] government has supported efforts of the commercial food and beverage industry to prevent the adoption of laws similar to Chile's by demanding [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] clauses forbidding the enactment of such consumer safety laws in Canada, Mexico and the United States.” Lora Verheecke, a researcher at the [[Corporate Europe Observatory]], a non-profit group tracking corporate lobbying, has declared that once such pro-industry and anti-consumer rules are enshrined into international trade agreements, it becomes extremely difficult to overturn them in the laws of trade-pact member states: “It kind of kills a law before it can be written, and once you put it into one trade agreement, it can become the precedent for all future deals with future countries.”&lt;ref name="nyt-mar2018"&gt;Azam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/americas/nafta-food-labels-obesity.html In NAFTA Talks, U.S. Tries to Limit Junk Food Warning Labels]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

'''The FACT-G''' (Version 4) is a [[patient-reported outcome]] measure used to assess [[Quality of life (healthcare)|health-related quality of life]] in patients undergoing [[cancer]] therapy.  The FACT-G is the original questionnaire that led to the development of the larger Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) collection of quality of life instruments.  The survey assesses the impacts of cancer therapy in four domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional.  The FACT-G is also offered with additional questions measuring cancer-specific factors that may affect quality of life, leading to the creation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - [[Head and neck cancer|Head and Neck]] (FACT-H&amp;N), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - [[Lung cancer|Lung]] (FACT-L), and 18 others.

== History and development ==
The Fact-G was developed by Dr. David Cella, now president and Chief Scientific Officer of FACIT.org and Chair of the Department of Medical Social Sciences at [[Feinberg School of Medicine|Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.facit.org/FACITOrg/AboutUs/StaffBios
| title = StaffBios
| website = www.facit.org
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed to assess the quality of life in cancer patients undergoing clinical trials for cancer therapy. Dr. Cella argues for the value of quality of life measures in general because "implicitly, the relief of a symptom is valued because of its associated benefit to patient function and well-being.  Explicitly, it is essential to determine whether any supportive-care intervention is producing a benefit that outweighs its cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to revisions and refinement, the FACT-G has been translated into over 60 languages.

== Structure and scoring ==
The FACT-G Version 4 has 27 questions, each of which is answered using a 5-point [[Likert scale]] ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much).  Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored.  Questions measure the respondents' health state over the last 7 days in four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 questions), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 questions), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 questions), and Functional Well-being (FWB, 7 questions).  Disease-specific versions of the FACT-G contain these four core subscales, with additional questions appended to address disease-specific factors.

Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a simple sum of item scores.  Each subscale is scored, and a total score for the FACT-G is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores. With a total possible score greater than 100, additional scoring methods have been used to simplify interpretation. Modifications of scoring include [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI).  The Trial Outcome Index is a simple sum of the Physical Well-Being and Functional Well-Being, and is intended as a summary index of functional status to be used as a clinical trails endpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=Kimberly|last2=Cella|first2=David|last3=Yost|first3=Kathleen|date=2003-12-16|title=The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System: properties, applications, and interpretation|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|volume=1|pages=79|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-1-79|issn=1477-7525|pmc=317391|pmid=14678568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==
The FACT-G is one of the most widely used patient-reported outcomes measures in cancer research along with the [[European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer]] Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), according to a 2011 [[systematic review]] comparing the two instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luckett|first=T.|last2=King|first2=M. T.|last3=Butow|first3=P. N.|last4=Oguchi|first4=M.|last5=Rankin|first5=N.|last6=Price|first6=M. A.|last7=Hackl|first7=N. A.|last8=Heading|first8=G.|date=2011-02-21|title=Choosing between the EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-G for measuring health-related quality of life in cancer clinical research: issues, evidence and recommendations|url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/21/annonc.mdq721|journal=Annals of Oncology|language=en|pages=mdq721|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdq721|issn=0923-7534|pmid=21339384|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest that researchers interested in the financial impact and physical symptoms of cancer treatment use the EORTC QLQ-C30, while those interested in health-related quality of life or with limited sample sizes use the FACT-G.  The review ultimately concludes that "Numerous studies have provided strong support for convergent and discriminant [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of both the QLQ-C30 and FACT-G" and provides an aid to "...clinical researchers in deciding which of the two questionnaires is the most appropriate for their purposes, driven by the outcomes that are of most interest."

Professional organizations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have embraced the FACT-G as a standard assessment of quality of life in cancer clinical trials.  The [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] requested that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] define the FACT-G as the gold standard assessment of health-related quality of life in a proposed amendment to the Food and Drug Administration's "Guidance for Industry on Clinical Trail Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics" although, this amendment was not included in the May 2007 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/05d0112/05D-0112_emc-000002-02.pdf|title=Regarding: Draft Guidance for industry on "Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics" [Docket No. 2005D-0112]|last=|first=|date=May 2007|website=|publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology|access-date=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Group at the [[University of Oxford]] reported that the FACT-G is a promising patient-reported outcome measurement that is worth piloting in the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://phi.uhce.ox.ac.uk/pdf/CancerReviews/PROMs_Oxford_BreastCancer_012011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, The [[Cancer Institute of New South Wales|Cancer Institute NSW]] in Australia scored multiple quality of life instruments used in cancer care, and cited the FACT-G as "most appropriate in the cancer setting" when measuring health related quality of life in cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cancerinstitute.org.au/media/144048/2011-1-31_factsheet_using-patient-reported-outcome-measures-in-cancer-setting.pdf|title=Using patient-reported outcome measures in the cancer setting|last=Cancer Institute NSW|first=|date=January 31, 2011|work=|access-date=March 17, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related scales ==
The creation of the FACT-G ultimately led to the development of the FACIT family of questionnaires for use in specific circumstances and additional diseases. There are over 20 cancer-specific scales such as the FACT-B for [[breast cancer]] and FACT-C for [[colorectal cancer]] and 27 symptom indexes which are short, 6 or 7 item subscales which focus only on symptoms. 12 treatment-specific measures focus on the quality of life impacts that patients receiving [[enteral feeding]] or with [[neurotoxicity]] experience. Finally, 13 non-cancer specific measures focus on topics beyond the impacts of disease and treatment, such as COST, which assesses financial impacts while the Facit-Sp measures spiritual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facit.org/FACITOrg/Questionnaires|title=Questionnaires|website=www.facit.org|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Health Equity Impact Analysis''' is a decision support tool which walks users through the steps of identifying how a program, [[policy]] or similar initiative will impact [[populations|population groups]] in different ways. HEIAs are meant to show, ''inter alia'', unintended potential impacts. The goal is to maximize positive impacts and reduce negative impacts that could potentially widen [[health]] [[health disparity|disparities]] between population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/heia/|title=Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) - Ministry Programs - Health Care Professionals - MOHLTC|work=gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{globalize|date=February 2016}}
'''Health administration''' or '''healthcare administration''' is the field relating to leadership, management, and administration of [[public health]] systems, [[health care systems]], [[hospital]]s, and [[hospital network]]s.

==Terminology==
Health systems management or health care systems management describes the leadership and general management of [[hospitals]], [[hospital network]]s, and/or [[health care systems]].  In international use, the term refers to management at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/management/en|title=World Health Organization - Management|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002640/http://www.who.int/topics/management/en/|archivedate=2009-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, management of a single institution (e.g. a hospital) is also referred to as "medical and health services management",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423042046/http://www.bls.gov/|archivedate=2013-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "healthcare management", or "health administration".

Health systems management ensures that specific outcomes are attained, that departments within a health facility are running smoothly, that the right people are in the right jobs, that people know what is expected of them, that resources are used efficiently and that all departments are working towards a common goal.

==Hospital administrators==
Hospital administrators are individuals or groups of people who act as the central point of control within hospitals. These individuals may be previous or current [[clinician]]s, or individuals with other backgrounds. There are two types of administrators, generalists and specialists. Generalists are individuals who are responsible for managing or helping to manage an entire facility. Specialists are individuals who are responsible for the efficient operations of a specific department such as policy analysis, finance, accounting, budgeting, human resources, or marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |title=Health Care Administrator |accessdate=11 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702233306/http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in September 2014, that the United States spends roughly $218 billion per year on hospital's administration costs, which is equivalent to 1.43 percent of the total [[United States economy|U.S. economy]]. Hospital administration has grown as a percent of the U.S. economy from .9 percent in 2000 to 1.43 percent in 2012, according to ''Health Affairs''. In 11 different countries, hospitals allocate approximately 12 percent of their budget toward administrative costs. In the United States, hospitals spend 25 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref name="Kliff-administractive costs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah|title=$1.43 of every $100 in America goes toward hospital administration|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|publisher=Vox|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915211307/http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|archivedate=15 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated qualifications===
Health care management is usually studied through healthcare administration&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;[http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ "Bachelor's Degree in Healthcare Administration"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208031955/http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ |date=2013-02-08 }} ''[[New England College]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or healthcare management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|title=Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration Healthcare Management - Online Healthcare Management Degree|author=|date=|website=Florida Tech Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820105146/http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|archivedate=2013-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; programs in a business school or, in some institutions, in a school of public health.

====North America====
Although many colleges and universities are offering a [[bachelor's degree]] in healthcare administration or human resources,&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt; a [[master's degree]] is considered the "standard credential"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics - Occupational Outlook Handbook entry|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105224955/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|archivedate=2009-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for most health administrators in the United States. Research and academic-based doctorate level degrees, such as the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Health Administration and the Doctor of Health Administration (DHA) degree, prepare health care professionals to turn their clinical or administrative experiences into opportunities to develop new knowledge and practice, teach, shape public policy and/or lead complex organizations.  There are multiple recognized degree types that are considered equivalent from the perspective of professional preparation.

The [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME) is the [[Educational accreditation|accrediting body]] overseeing master's-level programs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on behalf of the [[United States Department of Education]]. It accredits several degree program types, including Master of Hospital Administration (MHA), [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Services Administration]] (MHSA), [[Master of Business Administration|Master of Business Administration in Hospital Management]] (MBA-HM), [[Master of Health Administration]] (MHA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH, MSPH, MSHPM), [[Master of Science]] (MS-HSM, MS-HA), and [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA).

====Nepal====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Health care management study is a new discipline in Nepal. [[Pokhara University]] offers a Hospital Management course. National Open College launched a four-year Bachelor's level (BHCM) course in September 2000 with an enrolment of 40 students, and the next year it also started a one-year postgraduate diploma (PGDHCM) and a two-year master's course (MHCM) in health care management. Nobel College at Sinamangal has also been offering a Bachelor’s level (BHCM) course since 2006. MD Hospital administration (MDHA) and Master in Hospital Management (MHM) are being started from 2013. It is uncertain how many citizens of Nepal are gaining healthcare management qualifications in other countries. There is an absence of  professional organization and regulation in the health care management profession in Nepal.

=== Professional organizations ===
There are a variety of different professional associations related to health systems management, which can be subcategorized as either personal or institutional membership groups. Personal membership groups are joined by individuals, and typically have individual skills and career development as their focus. Larger personal membership groups include the [[Healthcare Financial Management Association]], and the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]]. Institutional membership groups are joined by organizations; whereas they typically focus on organizational effectiveness, and may also include data-sharing agreements and other medical related or administrative practice sharing vehicles for member organizations. Prominent examples include the [[American Hospital Association]] and the University Healthsystems Consortium.

==History==

Early hospital administrators were called patient directors or superintendents. At the time, many were nurses who had taken on administrative responsibilities. Over half of the members of the [[American Hospital Association]] were graduate nurses in 1916. Other superintendents were medical doctors, laymen and members of the clergy. 
In the United States, the first degree granting program in the United States was established at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. By 1927, the first two students received their degrees. The original idea is credited to Father Moulinier, associated with the Catholic Hospital Association.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, Cynthia Carter [http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf "A Brief History of Healthcare Management"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050920/http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern health systems management program was established in 1934 at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|title=University of Chicago - Graduate Program in Health Administration and Policy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620062442/http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, programs were completed in two years – one year of formal graduate study and one year of practicing internship.  In 1958, the Sloan program at [[Cornell University]] began offering a special program requiring two years of formal study,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, R. (1999). "In sickness and in wealth: American hospitals in the twentieth century."  Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the dominant structure in the United States and Canada today (see also "Academic Preparation").

Health systems management has been described as a "hidden" health profession&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, C. C., &amp; McLean, R. D. (2002). "Careers in Healthcare Management: How to Find your Path and Follow It."  Chicago: Health Administration Press.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the relatively low-profile role managers take in health systems, in comparison to direct-care professions such as nursing and medicine.  However the visibility of the management profession within healthcare has been rising in recent years, due largely to the widespread problems developed countries are having in balancing cost, access, and quality in their hospitals and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2006).

The '''health effects of salt''' are the conditions associated with the consumption of either too much or too little [[salt]]. Salt is a [[mineral]] composed primarily of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) and is used in food for both [[food preservation|preservation]] and [[flavor]]. [[Sodium]] ions are [[sodium in biology|needed in small quantities by most living things]], as are [[chloride]] ions. Salt is involved in regulating the [[water]] content ([[fluid balance]]) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.090034797|title=Sodium channel Nav1.6 is localized at nodes of Ranvier, dendrites, and synapses|year=2000|last1=Caldwell|first1=J.

[[Hyponatremia]], or blood sodium levels below 135 mEq/L, causes brain cells to swell; the symptoms can be subtle and may include altered personality, lethargy, and confusion.

==Long-term effects==
{{See|Salt and cardiovascular disease}}

About 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily. Widespread advice that salt intake be restricted below this range is not supported by evidence from [[randomized controlled trial]]s nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graudal |first1=N |last2=Jürgens |first2=G |title=Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines. |journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases |date=2 May 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2018.04.008 |pmid=29727609}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess sodium consumption can increase blood pressure.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Most studies suggest a "U" shaped association between salt intake and health, with increased mortality associated with both excessively low and excessively high salt intake.&lt;ref name="mente_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graudal_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Asayama K, etal | year = 2014 | title = Systematic Review of Health Outcomes in Relation to Salt Intake Highlights the Widening Divide Between Guidelines and the Evidence | url = http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/9/1138.full?sid=e5a0d581-b7cd-4649-a5aa-d52dba98246c | journal = American Journal of Hypertension | volume = 27 | issue = 9| pages = 1138–1142 | doi = 10.1093/ajh/hpu126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report stated that people excreting less salt (thus, presumably ingesting less) were at increased risk of dying from heart disease. However, a recent [[meta-analysis]] conducted by the Cochrane Hypertension group found this article was subject to methodological flaws, and urges great caution when interpreting their results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He FJ, Li J, MacGregor GA | year = 2013| title = Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2013 | issue = 4| page = CD004937 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004937.pub2 | pmid=23633321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-analysis investigated the association between sodium intake and health outcomes, including all-cause mortality and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) events.&lt;ref name="graudal_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/03/26/ajh.hpu028.1.full.pdf | title=Compared With Usual Sodium Intake, Low- and Excessive-Sodium Diets Are Associated With Increased Mortality: A Meta-Analysis | publisher=American Journal of Hypertension | date=1 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014 | last1=Graudal|first1=Niels|last2=Jürgens|first2=Gesche|last3=Baslund|first3=Bo|last4=Alderman|first4=Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium intake level was a [[mean]] of &lt;115&amp;nbsp;mmol (2645&amp;nbsp;mg), usual sodium intake was 115-215&amp;nbsp;mmol (2645–4945&amp;nbsp;mg), and a high sodium intake was &gt;215&amp;nbsp;mmol (4945&amp;nbsp;mg), concluding: "Both low sodium intakes and high sodium intakes are associated with increased mortality, consistent with a U-shaped association between sodium intake and health outcomes".

===Possible effects of microplastic contamination===
Studies have found some [[microplastic]] contamination in sea salt from the US, Europe and China. The health effects of this contamination are unknown because, as of 2017, no studies on the question had been performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
Recommended intakes of salt are usually expressed in terms of sodium intake as an [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) and a [[Tolerable upper intake level]] (Upper Limit or UL). Salt (as sodium chloride) contains 39.3&amp;nbsp;percent of sodium by weight.

As of 2009 the average sodium consumption in 33 countries was in the range of 2,700 to 4,900&amp;nbsp;mg/day. This ranged across many cultures, and together with animal studies, this suggests that sodium intake is tightly controlled by feedback loops in the body. This makes recommendations to reduce sodium consumption below 2,700&amp;nbsp;mg/day potentially futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2215/CJN.04660709|title=Can Dietary Sodium Intake Be Modified by Public Policy?|year=2009|last1=McCarron|first1=D.

==Labeling==
UK: The [[Food Standards Agency]] defines the level of salt in foods as follows: "High is more than 1.5 g salt per 100 g (or 0.6 g sodium). Low is 0.3 g salt or less per 100 g (or 0.1 g sodium). If the amount of salt per 100 g is in between these figures, then that is a medium level of salt." In the UK, foods produced by some supermarkets and manufacturers have 'traffic light' colors on the front of the packet: red (high), amber (medium), or green (low).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salt.gov.uk/understanding_labels.html Understanding labels]. Salt.gov.uk (6 November 2009). Retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

USA: The FDA ''Food Labeling Guide'' stipulates whether a food can be labeled as "free" "low," or "reduced/less" in respect of sodium. When other health claims are made about a food (e.g., low in fat, calories, etc.), a disclosure statement is required if the food exceeds 480&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium per 'serving'.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Drug Administration [https://web.archive.org/web/20060321031336/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-6a.html A Food Labeling Guide—Appendix A]&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaign" aimed to reduce the consumption of salt by Australians to 6g per day over the course of five years ending in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltmatters.org/ |title=Drop the Salt! Campaign |publisher=Australian Division on World Action on Salt &amp; Health |accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, New York City launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI).&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt; It is the only coordinated, voluntary effort to reduce sodium in the United States, an effort supported by the Institute of Medicine as an interim goal in advance of federal action on sodium reduction.

As of 2013, over 90 state and local health authorities and health organizations have signed on as partners of the NSRI. Together, the NSRI partnership encourages food manufacturers and chain restaurants to voluntarily commit to NSRI sodium reduction targets for 2012 and 2014. The NSRI aims to reduce sodium in the food supply by 25 percent in five years and reduce population sodium intake by 20 percent in the same time, thereby reducing risk for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;ref name="nsri"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/national-salt-reduction-initiative.page|title=Sodium initiatives|publisher=National Salt Reduction Initiative, City of New York|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one companies met their 2012 NSRI commitment. Notable reductions include: 15 percent reduction of sodium in Heinz ketchup; 32 percent reduction of sodium in the Subway’s Subway Club sandwich; 33 percent reduction of sodium in Nabisco’s Honey Teddy Grahams; 18 percent reduction of sodium in Kraft Single American Slices; and 20 percent reduction of Ragu Old World Style Traditional Tomato Sauce.&lt;ref name=nsri/&gt;

Separate from the NSRI, a number of major food producers have pledged to reduce the sodium content of their food. [[Pepsi]] is developing a "designer salt" that's slightly more powdery than the salt it regularly uses. The company hopes this new form of salt will cut sodium levels by 25&amp;nbsp;percent in its Lay's potato chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = McKay, Betsy | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 | title = PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 22 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nestlé|Nestlé's]] prepared foods company, which produces frozen meals, announced that it will reduce sodium in its foods by 10&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101023180822/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nestle-prepared-foods-company-to-decrease-sodium-by-another-10-by-2015-105520828.html Nestle Prepared Foods Company to Decrease Sodium by Another 10% by 2015"], Prnewswire&lt;/ref&gt;
[[General Mills]] announced that it will reduce the sodium content of 40&amp;nbsp;percent of its foods by about 20&amp;nbsp;percent by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Thomas, Caroline, [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Financial-Industry/General-Mills-announces-sodium-reduction-strategy/ "General Mills announces sodium reduction strategy,"] Food Navigator, 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of chain restaurants have made pledges to lower sodium over time. MenuStat, a free online database of past and current nutrition data from chain restaurants developed by the NYC Health Department, is available to monitor and evaluate these pledges.

In the United States, taxation of sodium has been proposed as a method of decreasing sodium intake and thereby improving health in countries where typical salt consumption is high.&lt;ref name="pmid15485985"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = N | title = Salt tax could reduce population's salt intake | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 329 | issue = 7471 | pages = 918 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15485985 | pmc = 523164 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7471.918-c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incirculation.net/hypertension/NewsItem/Salt-tax-could-massively-reduce-US-mortality-rates.aspx |title=Salt tax could massively reduce US mortality rates, healthcare costs|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an alternative view, the Salt Institute, a salt industry body based in North America, is active in promoting the use of salt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/About-Us|title=About the Salt Institute|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questioning or opposing the recommended restrictions on salt intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltinstitute.org/Issues-in-focus/Food-salt-health|title=Food salt &amp; health|year=2009 |publisher=Salt Institute |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary reduction==

A [[low sodium diet]] reduces the intake of sodium by the careful selection of food. The use of a [[salt substitute]] can provide a taste offsetting the perceived blandness of low-salt food; [[potassium chloride]] is widely used for this purpose. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends daily potassium intake of not less than 3,510&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name=who2013/&gt; Excessive potassium intake may be detrimental to health, and it is advised that potassium chloride not be used by those taking certain prescription drugs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The use of [[seaweed]] granules in the manufacture of processed foods is being researched as an alternative to salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seaweed granules may replace salt in foods |author=Daniells, Stephen |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Seaweed-granules-may-replace-salt-in-foods |newspaper=FoodNavigator.com |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials reported that lowered dietary salt intake lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension by about 3.5%, indicating that it might be a useful supplementary treatment for hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graudal|first1=NA|last2=Hubeck-Graudal|first2=T|last3=Jurgens|first3=G|title=Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglyceride.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD004022|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub4|pmid=28391629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people with normal blood pressure, the decrease after lowering dietary salt intake was less than 1%. The effects in Asians and blacks with hypertension were greater than in whites, but more studies are needed to confirm conclusions. Effects of lowered salt intake on hormones and lipids were similar in normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

Studies found that excessively low sodium intake, below about three grams of salt per day, is associated with increased mortality and higher risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="mente_2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graudal_2014" /&gt;

The [[English-language Wikipedia]] was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics.&lt;ref name="around half"&gt;{{cite web |title=Around half of Wikipedia's medical editors are experts |url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/12/05/around-half-of-wikipedias-medical-editors-are-experts/ |work=Wikimedia Blog |first=Nusa |last=Faric |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=James M|last2=West|first2=Andrew G|title=Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=17|issue=3|year=2015|pages=e62|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.4069|pmid=25739399|pmc=4376174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Amount of health content==
As of the end of 2013, the English Wikipedia had 29,072 medical articles, while across all language versions of Wikipedia, there were 155,805 medical articles.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt; As of March 2017, the English Wikipedia had 30,000 medical articles, while there were 164,000 medical articles in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shafee |first1=Thomas |last2=Masukume |first2=Gwinyai |last3=Kipersztok |first3=Lisa |last4=Das |first4=Diptanshu |last5=Häggström |first5=Mikael |last6=Heilman |first6=James |date=November 2017 |title=Evolution of Wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future |url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1122 |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=1122–1129 |doi=10.1136/jech-2016-208601|pmid=28847845 |pmc=5847101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were about 6,000 anatomy articles on the English Wikipedia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ledger |first1=Thomas Stephen |date=September 2017 |title=Introduction to anatomy on Wikipedia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=231 |issue=3 |pages=430–432 |doi=10.1111/joa.12640|pmid=28703298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these are not classified as "medical articles" in Wikipedia's categorization scheme and thus are not included in the 30,000 figure above.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Academic studies==

===Accuracy and usefulness===
A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had "a remarkably high level of internal validity".&lt;ref name=jacs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devgan|first1=Lara|last2=Powe|first2=Neil|last3=Blakey|first3=Brittony|last4=Makary|first4=Martin|title=Wiki-Surgery?

A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia "has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database [[Medscape Drug Reference]].&lt;ref name="clauson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clauson|first1=K.

A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haigh|first1=CA|title=Wikipedia as an evidence source for nursing and healthcare students.|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=February 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=135–9|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2010.05.004|pmid=20646799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five [[statin]]s, and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kupferberg|first1=N|last2=Protus|first2=BM|title=Accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia: an assessment.|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date=October 2011|volume=99|issue=4|pages=310–3|pmid=22022226|doi=10.3163/1536-5050.99.4.010|pmc=3193353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that "Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavsa|first1=Stacey M.|last2=Corman|first2=Shelby L.|last3=Culley|first3=Colleen M.|last4=Pummer|first4=Tara L.|title=Reliability of Wikipedia as a medication information source for pharmacy students|journal=Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning|date=April 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.cptl.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of Wikipedia articles in 2012 on [[dietary supplements]] found that Wikipedia articles were "frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products."&lt;ref name="PhillipsLam2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lam|first2=Connie|last3=Palmisano|first3=Lisa|title=Analysis of the accuracy and readability of herbal supplement information on Wikipedia|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|volume=54|issue=4|year=2014|pages=406–14|issn=1544-3191|doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13181|pmid=25063262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 scoping review published in the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wikis and Collaborative Writing Applications in Health Care: A Scoping Review|url = http://www.jmir.org/2013/10/e210/|journal = [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|date = 8 October 2013|pmc = 3929050|pmid = 24103318|volume = 15|issue = 10|doi = 10.2196/jmir.2787|first = Patrick M|last = Archambault|first2 = Tom H van de|last2 = Belt|first3 = Francisco J Grajales|last3 = III|first4 = Marjan J|last4 = Faber|first5 = Craig E|last5 = Kuziemsky|first6 = Susie|last6 = Gagnon|first7 = Andrea|last7 = Bilodeau|first8 = Simon|last8 = Rioux|first9 = Willianne LDM|last9 = Nelen|page = e210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study that examined 97 Wikipedia articles about [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM) found that 4% of them had attained "Good article" status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koo|first1=Malcolm|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine on Wikipedia: Opportunities for Improvement|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=1–4|doi=10.1155/2014/105186|pmid=24864148|pmc=4016830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In May 2014, ''[[The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]]'' published an article which concluded that "Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Hasty|first1 = Robert|last2 = Garvalosa|first2 = Ryan|last3 = Barbato|first3 = Vincenzo|last4 = Valdes|first4 = Pedro|last5 = Powers|first5 = David|last6 = Hernandez|first6 = Emmanuel|last7 = John|first7 = Jones|last8 = Suciu|first8 = Gabriel|last9 = Qureshi|first9 = Farheen|last10 = Popa-Radu|first10 = Matei|last11 = San Jose|first11 = Sergio|last12 = Drexler|first12 = Nathaniel|last13 = Patankar|first13 = Rohan|last14 = Paz|first14 = Jose|last15 = King|first15 = Christopher|last16 = Gerber|first16 = Hilary|last17 = Valladares|first17 = Michael|last18 = Somji|first18 = Alyaz|title = Wikipedia vs Peer-Reviewed Medical Literature for Information About the 10 Most Costly Medical Conditions|journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume = 114|issue = 5|year = 2014|pages = 368–373|issn = 0098-6151|doi = 10.7556/jaoa.2014.035|pmid = 24778001}}

A 2014 study found that when the FDA issues new safety warnings about drugs, in 41% of cases reviewed Wikipedia articles about those drugs were updated to give the new safety information within two weeks.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Bourgeois|first2=Florence T.|last3=Seeger|first3=John D.|title=Drug Safety in the Digital Age|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=26|year=2014|pages=2460–2462|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1401767|pmid=24963564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 23% of Wikipedia drug articles were updated to give this information within an average of about 40 days, but 36% of articles are not updated with this information within a year.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"/&gt;

A 2014 comparison between selected drug information from pharmacology textbooks and comparable information on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language]] and [[German Wikipedia|German-language]] Wikipedias found that the drug information in Wikipedia covers most of what is essential for undergraduate pharmacology studies and that it is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Accuracy and Completeness of Drug Information in Wikipedia: A Comparison with Standard Textbooks of Pharmacology|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 24 September 2014|pmc = 4174509|pmid = 25250889|pages = e106930|volume = 9|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0106930|first = Jona|last = Kräenbring|first2 = Tika|last2 = Monzon Penza|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Gutmann|first4 = Susanne|last4 = Muehlich|first5 = Oliver|last5 = Zolk|first6 = Leszek|last6 = Wojnowski|first7 = Renke|last7 = Maas|first8 = Stefan|last8 = Engelhardt|first9 = Antonio|last9 = Sarikas|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j6930K}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study comparing the coverage of the [[MMR vaccine controversy|autism-vaccine controversy]] on several websites found that Wikipedia's articles were broadly pro-vaccine. The study attributed this pro-vaccine stance to "this highly controversial topic attracting committed editors who strictly enforce the requirements for academic references."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venkatraman |first1=Anand |last2=Garg |first2=Neetika |date=2015 |title=Greater freedom of speech on Web 2.0 correlates with dominance of views linking vaccines to autism |journal=Vaccines |volume=17 |issue=33 |pages=1422–1425 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.01.078|pmid=25665960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readability===

A 2013 review of [[nephrology]] content on Wikipedia found it to be "a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = G.

A 2014 study found that Wikipedia's article on [[Parkinson's disease]] had a [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests#Flesch reading ease|Flesch reading ease]] score of 30.31, meaning that it was difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Erro|first2=R|title=The readability of the English Wikipedia article on Parkinson's disease|journal=Neurological Sciences|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1045–6|date=18 January 2015|pmid=25596713|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study evaluating 134 Wikipedia articles on [[autoimmune disease]]s found that they were very difficult to read and required at least a university graduate reading level.

===Alternative medicine===

People who promote [[alternative medicine]] have complained that Wikipedia negatively portrays [[holistic health]] treatments including [[energy medicine]], [[Emotional Freedom Techniques]], [[Thought Field Therapy]] and [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]].&lt;ref name="Time March 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/36938/wikipedia-founder-sticks-it-to-lunatic-holistic-healers/ |title=Wikipedia Founder Sticks It To 'Lunatic' Holistic Healers |first=Alexandra |last=Sifferlin |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Wales has stated, "If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals – that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately."&lt;ref name="Time March 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay Newman, Lily (27 March 2014) [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/27/jimmy_wales_denies_petition_from_advocates_of_holistic_healing_about_wikipedia.html Jimmy Wales Gets Real, and Sassy, About Wikipedia's Holistic Healing Coverage], [[Slate (magazine)]] Retrieved 23 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energypsych.org/?wikipediastatement ACEP's Position Statement on Wikipedia] energypsych.org Retrieved 23 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been raised regarding its coverage of [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/dysfunction-at-wikipedia-_b_5924226.html|title = Dysfunction at Wikipedia on Homeopathic Medicine|last = Ullman|first = Dana|date = 10 October 2014|work = [[The Huffington Post]]|access-date = 23 November 2014|via = |author-link = Dana Ullman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia policy for articles that "could reasonably be perceived as relating to human health" comes under the policy for [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources (medicine-related articles)|medicine-related articles]] which is [[science]]-based.

===General public===

A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received. For example, Wikipedia's article on [[multiple sclerosis]] was far more popular than its articles on more common disorders like [[migraine]], [[epilepsy]], or [[stroke]]. The authors theorized that this might be due to the increasing prevalence of [[MRI scans]], which has led to an increase in incidental findings of [[white matter lesion]]s. Although most of these lesions have nothing to do with multiple sclerosis, they may lead patients, relatives, and even physicians to perform Internet searches on "multiple sclerosis", which may lead them to the Wikipedia article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brigo |first1=Francesco  |last2=Igwe |first2=Stanley C. |last3=Nardone |first3=Raffaele |last4=Lochner |first4=Piergiorgio |last5=Tezzon |first5=Freudiano |last6=Otte |first6=Willem M. |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia and neurological disorders |url=https://www.jocn-journal.com/article/S0967-5868(15)00099-5/fulltext |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1170–1172 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2015.02.006|pmid=25890773  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical students===
Wikipedia's health information has been described as "transforming how our next doctors learn medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2013/11/18/wikipedia-role-medical-education-brings-awesome-promise-and-few-risks/iasrC5cWfCPhWkF9R0mZ4L/story.html |title=Wikipedia's role in medical education brings awesome promise — and a few risks |first=Nathaniel P. |last=Morris |work=bostonglobe.com |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators in health education have said that Wikipedia is popular among medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teunis|first1=Teun|title=The Wikipedia Guide to Medicine Could the Online Encyclopaedia Provide the Basis for a New Medical School Curriculum?|journal=Student BMJ|date=March 2013|volume=21|pages=16–17|doi=10.1136/sbmj.f1091|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.f1091|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study done at a single medical school showed that 97% of students used Wikipedia to study medicine, with the most common reasons being ease of access and ease of understanding. There was no relationship between a student's year in medical school and his or her use of Wikipedia, but students further along in medical school were less likely to use Wikipedia as their first resource, only resource, or most common resource; they were also more likely to perceive Wikipedia as unreliable.&lt;ref name="AllahwalaNadkarni2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allahwala|first1=Usaid K.|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Aniket|last3=Sebaratnam|first3=Deshan F.|title=Wikipedia use amongst medical students – New insights into the digital revolution|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=35|issue=4|year=2013|pages=337|issn=0142-159X|doi=10.3109/0142159X.2012.737064|pmid=23137251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[UCSF School of Medicine]] began to offer fourth-year medical students a month-long elective centered around improving Wikipedia's health-related articles. Between 2013 and 2015, 43 students took part in the course and chose a single health-related article to work on. A study of their contributions by UCSF faculty found that the students expanded their articles, added higher-quality sources, removed lower-quality sources, and improved readability. The study's authors argued that medical schools should encourage students to contribute to Wikipedia, both to improve the quality of its content and to enable students to become better health care educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azzam |first1=A |last2=Bresler |first2=D |last3=Leon |first3=A |last4=Maggio |first4=L |last5=Whitaker |first5=E |last6=Heilman |first6=J |last7=Orlowitz |first7=J |last8=Swisher |first8=V |last9=Rasberry |first9=L |last10=Otoide |first10=K |last11=Trotter |first11=F |last12=Ross |first12=W |last13=McCue |first13=JD |title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School. |journal=Academic Medicine |date=February 2017 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=194–200 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381 |pmid=27627633 |pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study of five European medical schools found that students who used Wikipedia for general information were more likely to use it to look up medical information. 16% of students used Wikipedia often for general information, 60% sometimes, and 24% rarely. 12% of students used Wikipedia often for medical information, 55% sometimes, and 33% rarely. Almost all of the students (97%) found inaccurate information on Wikipedia at least once, but less than 20% of them corrected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=Verena G. |last2=Frings |first2=Andreas |last3=Rehatschek |first3=Herwig |last4=Richard |first4=Gilbert |last5=Leithner |first5=Andreas |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia – challenges and new horizons in enhancing medical education |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=15 |issue=32 |pages= 32|doi=10.1186/s12909-015-0309-2|pmid=25879421 |pmc=4384304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study of online resource use by first-year medical students at [[Melbourne Medical School]] found that they used the school's online learning platform most often (daily) and used Google and Wikipedia slightly less often (approximately daily). The students considered the learning platform to be most useful, followed by Google and Wikipedia, which they considered slightly less useful than the learning platform but significantly more useful than Facebook or [[Google Scholar]]. They also considered the learning platform to be the most reliable and considered Google and Wikipedia to be significantly less reliable, although they frequently used both websites as a starting point for finding information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judd |first1=Terry |last2=Elliott |first2=Kristine |date=2017 |title=Selection and Use of Online Learning Resources by First-Year Medical Students: Cross-Sectional Study |url=http://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e17/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research I |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e17 |doi=10.2196/mededu.7382|pmid=28970187 |pmc=5643842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study of resources used by medical students during their general surgery [[Clinical clerkship|clerkship]] at the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] found that review books were the most commonly used type of study resource, followed by the Internet. Wikipedia was the third-most commonly used resource and the most commonly used Internet resource. The study found no correlation between the type of resource used and students' performance on the NBME surgery subject exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Janice A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Christiana M. |last3=Tan |first3=Sanda A. |last4=Falcone |first4=John L. |date=2017 |title=Are the kids alright?

===Residents===
A 2009 study of Internet use by 35 [[junior doctors]] in the United Kingdom found that 80% of them used Google and 70% of them used Wikipedia to look up medical information at least once a week, while only 30% used [[PubMed]]. Google and Wikipedia were primarily used for background reading, while PubMed and other "best evidence" websites were used to answer specific questions for clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Benjamin |last2=Joshi |first2=Indra |last3=Lemonde |first3=Hugh |last4=Wareham |first4=Jonathan |date=October 2009 |title=Junior physician's use of Web 2.0 for information seeking and medical education: A qualitative study |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505609000756?via%3Dihub |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=645–655 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.04.008|pmid=19501017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of psychiatry residents at [[Harvard Medical School]] found that they used online resources twice as often as they used printed resources. The three most commonly used resources were UpToDate, [[PubMed]], and Wikipedia. UpToDate was the most used resource and was considered to be the most trustworthy, while PubMed was the second most used resource and was highly rated as a source of personal learning. Wikipedia was the third most used resource and received the highest ranking for ease of use; however, it was considered the least trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torous |first1=John |last2=Franzen |first2=Jamie |last3=O’Connor |first3=Ryan |last4=Mathew |first4=Ian |last5=Keshavan |first5=Matcher |last6=Kitts |first6=Robert |last7=Boland |first7=Robert |date=2015 |title=Psychiatry Residents' Use of Educational Websites: A Pilot Survey Study |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=630–633 |doi=10.1007/s40596-015-0335-8|pmid=26077007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicians and other health professionals===
A 2014 study of 259 health professionals in Spain found that while 53% of them used the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] to look up medical information during work, only 3% of them considered it reliable and only 16% recommended it to their patients. Only 16% had ever edited a Wikipedia article; the most common reasons for not doing were that they did not consider themselves an expert (51%), they preferred to blog or publish peer-reviewed articles (21%), and they were concerned that someone would undo any contributions they made (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santillán |first1=Azucena |last2=Máñez |first2=Miguel Ángel |last3=Meijome |first3=Xose Manuel |date=2014 |title=Uso de Wikipedia por los profesionales de la salud |trans-title=Use of Wikipedia by health professionals |url=http://www.gacetasanitaria.org/es/uso-wikipedia-por-los-profesionales/articulo/S0213911114001964/ |language=Spanish |journal=Gaceta Sanitaria |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=522 |doi=10.1016/j.gaceta.2014.04.014|pmid=25087118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of contributors==
A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students.&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; An author of this study wrote that this provides "reassurance about the reliability of the website".&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; The study also found that the "core editor community", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farič|first1=Nuša|last2=Potts|first2=Henry WW|title=Motivations for Contributing to Health-Related Articles on Wikipedia: An Interview Study|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=16|issue=12|year=2014|pages=e260|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.3569|pmid=25498308|pmc=4275502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that Wikipedia editors who contributed to articles on [[designer drug]]s were most likely to also contribute to articles on illegal drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, implying that they have a background in pharmacology. They were also more likely to contribute to articles on neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, other diseases, and cell biology; they were least likely to edit articles about popular culture topics or history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Louis J. |last2=Krieg |first2=Lisa J. |date=2016 |title=From MDMA to Lady Gaga: Expertise and contribution behavior of editing communities on Wikipedia |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916326801 |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=1 |pages=96–106 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.11.013|bibcode=2010ProCS...1.1119G |arxiv=1005.5384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthism''', sometimes called '''public-healthism''', is a [[neologism]] to describe a variety of [[ideology|ideological]] constructs concerning health and medicine. The term "healthism" was most likely first used by the political economist [[Robert Crawford (political economist)|Robert Crawford]], whose article "Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert Crawford, ''Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life''. (Health:, Vol. 10, No. 4, 401-420 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, "[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual." The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book ''The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism'' by [[Petr Skrabanek]]. Skrabanek's use of "healthism", and most subsequent uses, are [[pejorative]] in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first documented case of a psychiatrist addressing the issue of homelessness and mental health was in 1906 by [[Karl Wilmanns]].{{sfnp|Bhugra|2007|p=19}}

==Historical context==

===United States===
In the United States, there are broad patterns of reform within the history of psychiatric care for persons with mental illness.&lt;ref name="Gittelman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gittelman|first=Martin|title=The Neglected Disaster|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|year=2005|volume=34|issue=2|jstor=41345126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} These patterns are currently categorized into three major cycles of reform. The first recognized cycle was the emergence of moral treatment and asylums, the second consists of the mental hygiene movement and the psychopathic (state) hospital, and most recent cycle includes [[deinstitutionalization]] and community mental health.&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"/&gt;{{rp|727}}  In an article addressing the historical developments and reforms of treatment for the mentally ill, Joseph Morrissey and Howard Goldman acknowledge the current regression of public social welfare for mentally ill populations. They specifically state that the "historical forces that led to the transinstitutionalization of the mentally ill from almshouses to the state mental hospitals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have now been reversed in the aftermath of recent deinstitutionalization policies".&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrissey|first=Joseph|author2=Howard Goldman|title=Care and Treatment of the Mentally Ill in the United States: Historical Developments and Reforms|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1986|volume=484|issue=12|doi=10.1177/0002716286484001002|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/484/1/12|pages=12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} Ultimately, Morrissey and Goldman argue that while each transition expanded the American mental health system into today's "pluralistic patchwork of public and private" structural efforts, each failed to make lasting effects on the societally debilitating nature of chronic mental illness, including the linked effects of poverty and homelessness.

====Asylums====
{{See|Greyhound therapy}}

Within the context of transforming schemas of moral treatment during the early nineteenth century, the humanitarian focus of public intervention was linked with the establishment of asylums or snake pits&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGY6DqB1HX8&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment of the mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Howard|author2=Joseph Morrissey|title=The Alchemy of Mental Health Policy: Homelessness and the Fourth Cycle of Reform|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1985|volume=75|issue=7|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.75.7.727|doi=10.2105/AJPH.75.7.727|pages=727–731|pmid=4003648|pmc=1646312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|727}} The ideology that emerged in Europe disseminated to America, in the form of a social reformation based on the belief that new cases of insanity could be treated by isolating the ill into "small, pastoral asylums" for humane treatment. These asylums were meant to combine medical attention, occupational therapy, socialization activities and religious support, all in a warm environment.

In America, Friends Asylum (1817) and the Hartford Retreat (1824) were among the first asylums within the private sector, yet public asylums were soon encouraged, with Dorothea Dix as one of its key lobbyists. The effectiveness of asylums was dependent on a collection of structural and external conditions, conditions that proponents began to recognize were unfeasible to maintain around the mid-nineteenth century. For example, with the proliferation of immigrants throughout industrialization, the original purpose of asylums as small facilities transformed into their actualized use as "large, custodial institutions" throughout the late 1840s.&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Overcrowding severely inhibited the therapeutic capacity, inciting a political reassessment period about alternatives to asylums around the 1870s. The legislative purpose of state asylums soon met the role society had funneled them toward; they primarily became institutions for community protection, with treatment secondary.

====State mental hospitals====
As debates regarding the deteriorating role of American asylums and psychiatry amplified around the turn of the century, new reformation arose. With the founding of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, acute treatment centers like psychopathic hospitals, psychiatric dispensaries and child guidance clinics were created. Beginning with the State Care Act in New York, states began assuming full financial control for the mentally ill, in an effort to compensate for the deprivations of asylums. Between 1903 and 1950, the number of patients in state mental hospitals went from 150,000 to 512,000. Morrissey recognizes that despite persistent problem of chronic mental illness, these state mental hospitals were able to provide a minimal level of care.&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

====Deinstitutionalization====
Toward the end of World War II, the influx of soldiers diagnosed with "war neurosis" incited a new public interest in community care. In addition to this, the view that asylums and state hospitals exacerbated symptoms of mental illness by being "inherently dehumanizing and antitherapeutic" spread through the public consciousness.  When psychiatric drugs like neuroleptics stabilized behavior and [[milieu therapy]] proved effective, state hospitals began discharging patients, with hope that federal programs and community support would counterbalance the effects of institutionalization. Furthermore, economic responsibility for the disabled began to shift, as religious and non-profit organization assumed the role of supplying basic needs.&lt;ref name="Gittelman 2005"/&gt;{{rp|10}} The modern results of deinstitutionalization show the dissonance between policy expectations and the actualized reality.&lt;ref name="Williams 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Donald|title=Deinstitutionalization and Social Policy: Historical Perspectives and Present Dilemmas|journal=American Orthopsychiatric Association|year=1980|volume=50|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60–61}}

====Community mental health centers====
In response to the flaws of deinstitutionalization, a reform movement reframed the context of the chronically mentally ill within the lens of public health and social welfare problems. Policy makers intentionally circumvented state mental hospitals by allocating federal funds directly to local agencies. For example, the Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) Act of 1963 became law, "which funded the construction and staffing of hundreds of federal centers to provide a range of services including partial hospitalization, emergency care, consultation, and treatment." Despite efforts, newly founded community centers "failed to meet the needs of acute and chronic patients discharged in increasing numbers from public hospitals". With decreased state collaboration and federal funding for social welfare, community centers essentially proved unable "to provide many essential programs and benefits", resulting in a growth of homelessness and indigency, or lack of access to basic necessities. It is argued that an over reliance on community health has "left thousands of former patients homeless or living in substandard housing, often without treatment, supervision or social support."&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"/&gt;{{rp|727–728}}

==Personal factors==

===Neurobiological determinants===
The mental health of homeless populations is significantly worse than the general population, with the prevalence of mental disorders up to four times higher in the former.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Katherine|author2=[[Pamela J. Taylor]] |author3=Adrian Bonner |author4=Marianne van den Bree |title=Risk Factors for Homelessness: Evidence from Population-Based Study|journal=Psychiatric Services|year=2009|volume=60|issue=4|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.60.4.465|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=100325}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}} It is also found that psychopathology and substance abuse often exist before the onset of homelessness, supporting the finding that mental disorders are a strong risk factor for homelessness.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|470}} Ongoing issues with mental disorders such as affective and anxiety disorders, substance abuse and schizophrenia are elevated for the homeless.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}}&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martens|first=Willem|title=Homelessness and Mental Disorders: A Comparative Review of Populations in Various Countries|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|year=2002|volume=30|issue=4|jstor=41344992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} One explanation for homelessness states that "mental illness or alcohol and drug abuse render individuals unable to maintain permanent housing."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Marta|author2=Lauren J. Krivo|title=Structural Determinants of Homelessness in the United States|journal=Social Problems|year=1991|volume=38|issue=1|doi=10.2307/800641|jstor=800641|pages=113–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} One study further states that 10-20 percent of homeless populations have a dual diagnoses, or the co-existence of substance abuse and of another severe mental disorder. For example, in Germany there is a link between alcohol dependence and schizophrenia with homeless populations.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

===Trauma===
There are patterns of biographical experience that are linked with subsequent mental health problems and pathways into homelessness.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}} Martens states that reported childhood experiences, described as "feeling unloved in childhood, adverse childhood experiences, and general unhappiness in childhood" seem to become "powerful risk factors" for adult homelessness. For example, Martens emphasizes the salient dimension of familial and residential instability, as he describes the prevalence of foster-care or group home placement for homeless adolescents. He notes that "58 percent of homeless adolescents had experienced some kind of out-of-home placement, running away, or early departure from home."&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Moreover, up to 50 percent of homeless adolescents report experience with physical abuse, and almost one-third report sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}} In addition to family conflict and abuse, early exposure to factors like poverty, housing instability, and alcohol and drug use all increase one's vulnerability to homelessness.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Barrett|author2=Kimberly Tyler|title=The New Homelessness Revisited|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2010|volume=36|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115940|jstor=25735089|pages=501–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once impoverished, the social dimension of homelessness manifests from "long exposure to demoralizing relationships and unequal opportunities."&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|81}}


===Trauma and Homeless Youth===

Youth experiencing homelessness are more susceptible of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Common psychological traumas experienced by homeless youth include, sexual victimization, neglect, experiences of violence, and abuse. &lt;ref name="Crosby 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Shantel|author2=Hsun-Ta Hsu|title=Factors that contribute to help-seeking among homeless, trauma-exposed youth: A social-ecological perspective|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|date=2018|volume=93|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.07.015|pages=126-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal factors==
Draine et al. emphasize the role of social disadvantage with manifestations of mental illness. He states that "research on mental illness in relation to social problems such as crime, unemployment, and homelessness often ignores the broader social context in which mental illness is embedded."&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draine|first=Jeffrey|title=Role of Social Disadvantage in Crime, Joblessness, and Homelessness Among Persons With Serious Mental Illness|journal=Psychiatric Services|year=2002|volume=53|issue=5|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.5.565|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/PSS/4347/565.pdf|pages=565–573}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|566}}

===Social barriers===
{{main|Discrimination against the homeless}}

====Stigma====
Lee argues that societal conceptualizations of homelessness and poverty can be juxtaposed, leading to different manifestations of public stigma. In his work through national and local surveys, respondents tended to deemphasize individual deficits over "structural forces and bad luck" for homeless individuals. In contrast, the respondents tended to associate personal failures more to the impoverished than homeless individuals.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|511}}

Nonetheless, homeless individuals are "well aware of the negative traits imputed to them -- lazy, filthy, irresponsible dangerous -- based on the homeless label." In an effort to cope with the emotional threat of stigma, homeless individuals may rely on one another for "non-judgmental socializing." However, his work continues to emphasize that the mentally ill homeless are often deprived of social networks like this.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|508}}

==== Social Isolation ====
People who are homeless tend to be socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polgar|first=Michael|last2=Watson|first2=Stephanie|year=2012|title=Homelessness|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Mental Health|edition=3rd.|volume= 1|pages=766–770|via=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have correlated that those who are homeless and have a strong support group tend to be more physically and mentally healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Stephen W.|last2=Kirst|first2=Maritt J.|last3=Chiu|first3=Shirley|last4=Tolomiczenko|first4=George|last5=Kiss|first5=Alex|last6=Cowan|first6=Laura|last7=Levinson|first7=Wendy|date=2017-01-26|year=|title=Multidimensional Social Support and the Health of Homeless Individuals|journal=Journal of Urban Health|volume=86|issue=5|pages=791–803|doi=10.1007/s11524-009-9388-x|issn=1099-3460|pmc=2729873|pmid=19629703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/LonelinessReport_FINAL.pdf|title=Loneliness and isolation|last=Sanders|first=Ben|date=December 2015|website=Crisis|publisher=Crisis|access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Racial inequality====
One dimension of the [[Homelessness in the United States|American homeless]] is the skewed proportion of minorities. In a sample taken from Los Angeles, 67.5 percent of the homeless men were African American. In contrast, the Netherlands sample had 42 percent Dutch, with 58 percent of the homeless population from other nationalities.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|89}} Furthermore, Lee notes that minorities have a heightened risk of the "repeated exit-and-entry pattern"&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|511}}

===Institutional barriers===
Shinn and Gillespie (1994) argued that although substance abuse and mental illness is a contributing factor to homelessness, the primary cause is the lack of [[low-income housing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/homelessness-health.aspx|title=Health &amp; Homelessness|publisher=APA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot and Krivo emphasize the structural conditions that increase vulnerability to homelessness. Within their study, these factors are specifically categorized into "unavailable low-cost housing, high poverty, poor economic conditions, and insufficient community and institutional support for the mentally ill."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|116}} Through their correlational analysis, they reinforce the finding that areas with more spending on mental health care have "notably lower levels of homelessness."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|122}} Furthermore, their findings emphasize that among the analyzed correlates, "per capita expenditures on mental health care, and the supply of low-rent housing are by far the strongest predictors of homelessness rates."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|127}} Along with economic hardship, patterns of academic underachievement also undermine an individual's opportunity for reintegration into general society, which heightens their risk for homelessness.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|470}}

On a psychological level, Lee notes that the "stressful nature of hard times (high unemployment, a tight housing market, etc.) helps generate personal vulnerabilities and magnifies their consequences."&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt; For example, poverty is a key determinant of the relationship between debilitating mental illness and social maladjustment; it is associated with decreased self-efficacy and coping. Moreover, poverty is an important predictor of life outcomes, such as "quality of life, social and occupational functioning, general health and psychiatric symptoms", all relevant aspects of societal stability.&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"/&gt;{{rp|566}} Thus, systemic factors tend to compound mental instability for the homeless. Tackling homelessness involves focusing on the risk factors that contribute to homelessness as well as advocating for structural change.

==Consequences==

===Incarceration===
It is argued that persons with mental illness are more likely to be arrested, simply from a higher risk of other associated factors with incarceration, such as substance abuse, unemployment, and lack of formal education. Furthermore, when correctional facilities lack adequate coordination with community resources upon release, the chances of recidivism increase for persons who are both homeless and suffering from a mental illness.  Every state in the United States [[Mentally ill prisoners in the United States|incarcerates more individuals with severe mental illness than it hospitalizes]]. Incarcerations are due to lack of treatments such as psychiatric hospital beds.&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"/&gt;{{rp|566}} Overall, according to Raphael and Stoll, over 60 percent of United States jail inmates report mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Steven|author2=Michael Stoll|title=Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=2013|volume=42|issue=1|url=: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/667773}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189}} Estimates from the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (2004) and the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (2002) report that the prevalence for severe mental illness (the psychoses and bipolar/manic-depressive disorders) is 3.1-6.5 times the rate observed for the general population.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|192}} In relation to homelessness, it is found that 17.3 percent of inmates with severe mental illness experienced a homeless state before their incarceration, compared to 6.5 percent of undiagnosed inmates.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|197}} The authors argue that a significant portion of deinstitutionalized mentally ill were transitioned into correctional facilities, by specifically stating that "transinstitutional effect estimates suggest that deinstitutionalization has played a relatively minor role in explaining the phenomenal growth in U.S. incarceration levels."&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|190}}

==Evidence based remediation practices==
*Integrated service system, between and within agencies in policy making, funding, governance and service delivery.
*Low barrier housing with support services.
*Building Assertive Community Teams (ACT) and Forensic Assertive Community Teams (FACT). 
*Assisted Community Treatment (ACT) 
*Outreach services that identify and connect homeless to the social service system and help navigate the complex, fragmented web of services.
*A community based project funding with collaborations between individuals and organizations.

==Modern responses==
Through longitudinal comparisons of sheltered homeless families and impoverished domiciled families, there are a collection of social buffers that slow one's trajectory toward homelessness. A number of these factors include "entitlement income, a housing subsidy, and contact with a social worker."&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|513}}

Modern efforts to reduce homelessness include "housing-first models", where individuals and families are placed in permanent homes with optional wrap-around services.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|514}} Furthermore, this effort is less expensive than the cost of institutions that serve tangled needs of the homeless, such as emergency shelters, mental hospitals and jails. Overall, this alternative approach has shown positive outcomes. For example, one study reports an 88 percent housing retention rate for those in Housing First, compared to 47 percent using traditional programs.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

Additionally, a review of permanent supportive housing and case management on health found that interventions using “housing-first models” can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from substance use disorders and severe mental illness. Improvements include positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. These models can also help reduce hospital admissions, length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units, and emergency room visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapid Evidence Review: What Housing-related Services and Supports Improve Health Outcomes among Chronically Homeless Individuals?|url=http://www.academyhealth.org/Programs/content.cfm?ItemNumber=19350|website=AcademyHealth: Advancing Research, Policy and Practice|publisher=AcademyHealth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919022156/http://www.academyhealth.org/Programs/content.cfm?ItemNumber=19350|archivedate=2016-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strides have also been made to dress the issue of social isolation within the homeless community.

At last count 3,000 of the 500,000 residents in Sonoma County were homeless.  Of those 3,000 roughly 35% reported suffering from mental illness, and each year these numbers continue to rise.  Massive cuts to funding and facility closures throughout the area have forced these individuals to find treatment at local emergency rooms and even the county jail.  This proves to be very costly for the county, and a very temporary fix for those in the throes of a mental health crises.  Mental illness is never cured after one hospital visit, but rather requires continual treatment and care far beyond a crisis.  Studies have shown that long-term treatment can improve the quality of life for many individuals and can reduce the number of homeless in the community.  Uninterrupted assistance greatly increases the chances of living independently and greatly reduces the chances of homelessness and incarceration &lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Bruckner, &amp; Brown, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.
Fear surrounds the introduction of mentally ill homeless housing and treatment centers into neighborhoods, as they are often associated with increased drug use and criminal activity.  Studies show that this is not necessarily the case.  One such study was conducted to evaluate the benefits of the Housing First model, which focuses on rapid rehousing in permanent accommodations without sobriety or treatment requirements but facilitates access to treatment resources in order to help individuals attain their mental health/sobriety goals after being housed.  Mentally ill homeless individuals with criminal records were studied over a 2-year period, and after being placed in the Housing First program only 30% re-offended. Overall results of the study showed a large reduction in re-conviction, increased public safety, and a reduction in crime rates &lt;ref&gt;Somers, Rezansoff, Moniruzzaman, Palepu, &amp; Patterson, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. A significant decline in drug use was also seen with the implementation of the Housing First model.  A study was conducted that showed a 50% increase in housing retention and a 30% increase in methadone treatment retention in program participants &lt;ref&gt;Palepu, Patterson, Moniruzzaman, Frankish, &amp; Somers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The mentally ill make up a significant portion of the homeless population in Sonoma County, and without long term treatment options they are forced into a cycle of living that puts both themselves and the community at risk.  Greatly improving their long-term treatment options can lead to permanent and stable living environments which can reduce the homeless population, improve crime rates, and increase overall public safety.

==Conclusion==
For some individuals, the pathways into homelessness may be upstream. E.g. issues such as housing, income level, or employment status. For others, the pathways may be more personal or individual. E.g. issues such as compromised mental health and well ‐ being, mental illness, and substance abuse. Many of these personal and upstream issues are interconnected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70561">The following is a summary of notable incidents at any of the [[amusement park]]s and [[water park]]s operated by [[Six Flags|Six Flags Entertainment Corporation]].  In some cases, these incidents occurred while the park was under different management or ownership.

This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park operations, or are otherwise significantly noteworthy. The term ''incidents'' refers to major accidents, injuries, or deaths that occur at a park.  While these incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred, they usually fall into one of the following categories:
# Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to violate park rules.
# The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.
# Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance safety instructions, or deliberate intent to violate park rules.
# [[Act of God]] or a generic accident (''e.g.'', lightning strike, slipping and falling), that is not a direct result of an action on anybody's part.

===Sky Ride===
* On June 24th, 2017, a 14-year-old girl from [[Greenwood, Delaware]] fell approximately {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} from her gondola, striking a tree before falling to the ground. The girl had slipped under the chair's safety bar while the ride was in motion. The ride was stopped when park visitors alerted the operators to the incident, while other visitors gathered underneath the girl to prepare to catch her. She ultimately fell into the group of visitors below her, with an unidentified 47-year-old man receiving a back injury from the attempt. The passenger received no serious injuries, and was taken to a local hospital. Park officials stated there did not appear to be a malfunction of the ride, but closed the ride pending review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{main|Le Vampire}}
*On July 6, 2012, a 67-year-old employee of the park was killed at ''Le Vampire''. The employee was reportedly found underneath the attraction in a restricted area, appearing to have suffered head trauma.  Park officials stated that the employee had been struck by the roller coaster. The employee was pronounced dead at the scene; another individual was taken to a hospital to be treated for shock. Officials with the park did not know why the employee entered the restricted area of the ride while it was operational, but they did state that the ride was operating normally and that procedures for entering restricted ride areas, including notification of ride staff, had not been followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Worker+dies+Ronde+accident+Montreal/6895065/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708203304/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Worker+dies+Ronde+accident+Montreal/6895065/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title=Worker dies in La Ronde accident in Montreal |work=MontrealGazette.com |publisher=Postmedia Network |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Joker's Jinx===
{{main|The Joker's Jinx}}
*On August 10, 2014, at about 3pm, 24 people were trapped on the roller coaster when the train stalled along the course. The train was upright on a curve near one of the highest points on the ride. The local fire department used an [[Fire_engine#Aerial_apparatus|aerial fire apparatus]] to bring down riders one at a time. By 7:30pm local time, all riders had been removed from the ride, which was immediately closed for investigation. Investigators claim that the stalled train was caused by debris on the track. No riders were injured, and all were evaluated by emergency personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Park Bomb Scare===
* On July 13, 2016, a bomb threat was called in right before the park opened. The Prince George's County Fire Department bomb squad and security personnel were deployed around the park and found two unattended backpacks that were determined not to be explosive. The all-clear was announced after a search of the park around 2:45 p.m. Six Flags announced that the park would be open until 8 p.m. that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/bomb-threat-at-amusement-park-in-prince-georges-county/2016/07/13/2ef2539e-490c-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html|title=Six Flags America reopens after bomb threat|author1 =Dana Hedgpeth|author2 =Justin Wm.

* On July 8, 2011, a 29-year-old guest was killed when he was ejected from the ''Ride of Steel'' roller coaster. The rider, an Iraq War veteran whose legs had been amputated, was on the front row of the roller coaster when he was thrown from the train during the course of the ride. Park officials stated that the ride was in proper mechanical order and that the various safety restraints were also working normally at the time of the incident, but that the attraction would remain closed pending an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9wsyr.com/news/local/story/Iraq-War-vet-dies-on-Darien-Lake-Rollercoaster/jM-zd3jWt0yhuwkx4Y1i4A.cspx|title=Iraq War vet dies on Darien Lake Rollercoaster|work=9WSYR.com|date=2011-07-08|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal attacks===
* On January 5, 1996, two trainers were attacked by [[cougar]]s during an exercise session.  One trainer was in the cougar enclosure to take one of the animals for a walk.  The cougars, Zuni and Tonto, had been playing among themselves and began aggressively playing with him, causing severe cuts on his face and upper torso.  The backup trainer suffered minor cuts and bruises in his attempt to free the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

*On August 25, 1999, 28 passengers were stranded on the [[Boomerang: Coast to Coaster|Boomerang]] ride for several hours.  The shuttle that pulled the train up an incline failed to release the train.  Employees were eventually able to fix the problem and started the coaster.  It successfully went around both loops on its first run, but stalled upside down at the peak of one of the loops on its way back and idled there for many hours.  Riders, suffered from cases of severe dehydration and sunburn, were rescued by firefighters in an aerial fire apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Haunted Castle===
*On May 11, 1984, eight teenage visitors were trapped in the [[Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Haunted Castle]] attraction, and died when it was destroyed by fire.  Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company [[Six Flags]] were subsequently indicted for [[Aggravation (law)|aggravated]] [[manslaughter]], accused of [[Recklessness (psychology)|recklessly]] causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire.  In the subsequent trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored.  The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was [[arson]] and that no precautions would have saved lives.  The trial jury found the defendants not guilty.&lt;ref name="COSTAL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hauntedattraction.com/33/industry.html#ind2 |title=Fire at the Haunted Castle (excerpted from ''Amusement Park Crisis Management'') |publisher=Haunted Attraction Magazine |accessdate=2008-09-21 |author=Joe Costal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018013158/http://www.hauntedattraction.com/33/industry.html#ind2 |archivedate=October 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A light bulb had burned out in one of the rooms of the attraction, and a 14-year-old boy lit a cigarette lighter to find his way through the darkness. The flame ignited some foam rubber padding which was used to protect people from bumping into a wall. A fire resulted, which quickly spread throughout the 17-trailer structure with the help of extremely flammable building materials. The fire eventually engulfed and totally destroyed the attraction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rideaccidents.com/rides.html|title=Amusement Ride Fatalities (1972–1997)|website=www.rideaccidents.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department's Office of Safety Compliance further concluded that the accident would not have occurred if proper procedures had been followed.  The park was found to be in violation of the Carnival/Amusement Ride Safety Act and was subsequently charged with the maximum state fine of $1,000.

===Rolling Thunder===
*On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from [[Middletown Township, New Jersey]] fell to his death from the Rolling Thunder roller coaster during a routine test run.  An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that the man may not have secured himself with the safety bar.  A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee "may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints."  The ride was inspected, and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was "operationally and mechanically sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Wheelie===
*In May 2009, four children became ill when the attraction failed to stop at the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a [[limit switch]] failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*On July 7, 1984, a 46-year-old woman from [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] was riding the [[River King Mine Train|Rail Blazer]] roller coaster when she was flung from the ride and fell {{convert|20|ft|m}} to her death.  Park officials claimed that the woman fainted and fell out of the car, but her husband, who had been beside her, said that she had not fainted but had simply been tossed from the ride when it whipped around a curve.  At the time, the ride was only the third stand-up roller coaster in the world, but following this incident it was converted back to a sit-down coaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Hurricane Harbor===
*In March 2016, two individuals broke into the park, went past three fences, and skateboarded down the Tornado water slide as a half pipe. They were arrested on felony charges of criminal damage to property, causing an estimated $20,000 in damages to the fiberglass coat covering the slide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/police-skateboarders-damage-water-slide/article_beb8bcbb-e0cf-5ad7-9de2-bdc165c7ef00.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance building===
*On July 11, 2010, a fire broke out in a maintenance building during operating hours, forcing the evacuation and closure of the park. The fire was contained to a single building, located adjacent to the park's wave pool and used principally for storage. Spokespeople for the water park and for the [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] fire department noted that everyone was evacuated safely and that there were no reported injuries. The park re-opened two days later on July 13 after crews had sealed off the damaged area caused by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/after-fire-white-water-568510.html|title=After fire, White Water to reopen Tuesday|author=Alexis Stevens|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2010-07-12|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infodemiology''' (and the closely related term [[infoveillance]]) is a term coined by [[Canada|Canadian]] researcher [[Gunther Eysenbach]]. Eysenbach defines "infodemiology" (or information epidemiology) as a "new research discipline and methodology [which deals with] the study of the determinants and distribution of health information [on the Internet]", with the ultimate goal to improve [[public health]]&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eysenbach | first1 = Gunther | date = Dec 2002 | title = Infodemiology: The epidemiology of (mis)information | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 113 | issue = 9| pages = 763–5 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(02)01473-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Infodemiology: tracking flu-related searches on the web for syndromic surveillance.|journal=AMIA ...

Eysenbach first used the term in the context of measuring and predicting the quality of health information on the web (i.e., measuring the "supply" side of information).&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002/&gt; 
He later included into his definition methods and techniques which are designed to automatically measure and track health information "demand" (e.g., by analyzing search queries) as well as "supply" (e.g., by analyzing postings on webpages, in blogs, and news articles, for example through [[Global Public Health Intelligence Network|GPHIN]]) on the Internet with the overarching goal to inform public health policy and practice. In 2013, the Infovigil Project was launched in an effort bring the research community together to help realize this goal, and is funded by the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infodemiology.org|title=The Infovigil Project|last=Eysenbach|first=Gunther|website=www.infodemiology.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenbach demonstrated his point by showing a correlation between flu-related searches on [[Google]] (demand data) and flu-[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] data.&lt;ref name=e2006/&gt; The method is shown to be better and more timely (i.e., can predict public health events earlier) than traditional [[syndromic surveillance]] methods such as reports by sentinel physicians.

A '''list of antibiotic resistant bacteria''' is provided below. These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or [[antimicrobial resistance]]).

== Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) ==
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1}}
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. In Indian hospitals [[hospital-acquired infection]]s are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, this can make them dangerous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Timothy R|last2=Weeks|first2=Janis|last3=Livermore|first3=David M|last4=Toleman|first4=Mark A|title=Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309911700597|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=11|issue=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(11)70059-7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were NDM-1-positive indicates widespread infection in New Delhi already back in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NDM-1 was first detected in a ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' isolate from a [[Sweden|Swedish]] patient of [[India]]n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/13/new_drug_resistant_superbugs_found_in_3_states/ |title=New drug-resistant superbugs found in 3 states|author=Marilynn Marchione|date=13 September 2010|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/about/healthzone.html|title=Superbug detected in GTA|author=Madeleine White|date=21 August 2010|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/08/japan_confirms_first_case_of_superbug_gene/|title=Japan confirms first case of superbug gene|last=Yuasa|first=Shino|date=8 September 2010|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. ''C. difficile'' infections commonly occur during hospitalization.&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats – Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance – CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that ''C. difficile'' infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html|title=CDC Press Releases|website=CDC|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. difficile'' colitis is most strongly associated with [[fluoroquinolones]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[carbapenem]]s, and [[clindamycin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baxter R, Ray GT, Fireman BH|date=January 2008|title=Case-control study of antibiotic use and subsequent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=44–50|doi=10.1086/524320|pmid=18171186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17072575"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gifford AH, Kirkland KB|date=December 2006|title=Risk factors for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea on an adult hematology-oncology ward|journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases|volume=25|issue=12|pages=751–5|doi=10.1007/s10096-006-0220-1|pmid=17072575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16156323"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Palmore TN, Sohn S, Malak SF, Eagan J, Sepkowitz KA|date=August 2005|title=Risk factors for acquisition of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea among outpatients at a cancer hospital|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=8|pages=680–4|doi=10.1086/502602|pmc=5612438|pmid=16156323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''===
{{Main|Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis}}
[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (multidrug-resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=LoBue P|year=2009|title=Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–73|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283229fab|pmid=19283912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Co-evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens, Brites, D., &amp; Gagneux, S. (2015).|date=2013-04-17|pmc=4339235 | pmid=25703549|doi=10.1111/imr.12264|volume=264|journal=Immunol Rev|pages=6–24 | last1 = Brites | first1 = D | last2 = Gagneux | first2 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis must cause a pulmonary disease in order to be successfully transmitted from one person to another. Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively drug-resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Qian|last2=Li|first2=Xia|year=2010|title=Transmission of MDR tuberculosis|journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms|volume=7|pages=e61|doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to ''parC'' [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]].&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2012/12/20/MycoplasmaGenitaliumTreatmentChoices.aspx|title=Mycoplasma Genitalium Treatment Choices|website=www.theonlineclinic.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tetracyclines]], including [[doxycycline]], have a low clinical eradication rate for ''M. genitalium'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=J.S.|last2=Cusini|first2=M.|last3=Gomberg|first3=M.|last4=Moi|first4=M.|date=9 August 2016|title=2016 European guideline on ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1650–1656|doi=10.1111/jdv.13849|pmid=27505296|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but [[pristinamycin]] was still able to eradicate the infection.&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg. Infect. Dis.|volume=10|issue=3|pages=514–7|doi=10.3201/eid1003.030252|pmc=3322805|pmid=15109426|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

== Gram negative ==

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'']] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=== Gamma proteobacteria ===

==== Enterobacteriaceae ====
As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of [[Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae|carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae]] (CRE), also known as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=====''Klebsiella pneumoniae''=====
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|KPC]])-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Corey|last2=Bent|first2=Zachary|last3=Meagher|first3=Robert|last4=Williams|first4=Kelly|date=June 7, 2014|title=Resistance Determinants and Mobile Genetic Elements of an NDM-1-Encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099209|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e99209|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099209|pmc=4048246|pmid=24905728}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbapenem]] antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnold RS, Thom KA, Sharma S, Phillips M, Kristie Johnson J, Morgan DJ|year=2011|title=Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=104|issue=1|pages=40–5|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181fd7d5a|pmc=3075864|pmid=21119555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''=====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]]. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name="Davies2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Davies J, Davies D|year=2010|title=Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|volume=74|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-10|pmc=2937522|pmid=20805405|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adam M, Murali B, Glenn NO, Potter SS|year=2008|title=Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|volume=8|issue=|pages=52|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-52|pmc=2262874|pmid=18282299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study focused on the development of resistance in ''E. coli'' to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

Resistance to [[polymyxins]] first appear in 2011.&lt;ref name="Nature2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reardon|first1=Sara|date=21 December 2015|title=Spread of antibiotic-resistance gene does not spell bacterial apocalypse — yet|url=http://www.nature.com/news/spread-of-antibiotic-resistance-gene-does-not-spell-bacterial-apocalypse-yet-1.19037|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.19037}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easier way for this resistance to spread, a [[plasmid]] known as [[MCR-1]] was discovered in 2015.&lt;ref name="Nature2015" /&gt;

==== Pseudomonadales ====

====''Acinetobacter''====
''[[Acinetobacter]]'' is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. [[Acinetobacter#Treatment|Multidrug-resistant ''Acinetobacter'']] have become very resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

On November 5, 2004, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported an increasing number of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the [[Iraq]]/[[Kuwait]] region during [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] were treated. Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.&lt;ref name="pmid15549020"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC).|year=2004|title=Acinetobacter baumannii infections among patients at military medical facilities treating injured U.S. service members, 2002–2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a1.htm|journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly.

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FDR-Wheelchair-February-1941.jpg|thumb|260px|Rare photograph of Roosevelt in a wheelchair, with Ruthie Bie and [[Fala (dog)|Fala]] (1941)]]

The paralytic illness of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] began in 1921 when the future [[President of the United States]] was 39 years old. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis]] at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. In 1926, his belief in the benefits of [[hydrotherapy]] led him to found [[Warm Springs Historic District|a rehabilitation center]] at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]. He avoided being seen using his wheelchair in public, but his disability was well known and became a major part of his image. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.

In August 1921, 39-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the time a practicing lawyer in New York, joined his family at their vacation home at [[Campobello Island|Campobello]], a Canadian island off the coast of Maine. As former [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], he had spent two weeks in mid-July in Washington, D.C., giving testimony to a Senate committee investigating a Navy scandal.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collier |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Collier (political author) |last2=Horowitz |first2=David |author-link2=David Horowitz |date=1994 |title=The Roosevelts: An American Saga |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster  |isbn=0671652257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247–248}} On August 5, Roosevelt sailed up the New England coast with his friend and new employer, [[Van Lear Black]], on Black's [[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|ocean-going yacht]]. Among those at Campobello when Roosevelt arrived were his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]], their children, his political aide [[Louis Howe]], Howe's wife, and their young son.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tobin |first1=James |title=The Man He Became: How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency |date=2013 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0743265165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–42}}

On August 10, after a day of strenuous activity, Roosevelt came down with an illness characterized by [[fever]], [[paralysis|ascending paralysis]], facial paralysis, prolonged [[bowel]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]] dysfunction, and numbness and [[dysesthesia|hypersensitivity of the skin]].&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|47}} Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down.

Roosevelt came close to death from the illness. He faced many life-threatening medical problems including the possibility of respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, injury to the urethra or bladder, decubitus ulcers, clots in the leg veins, and malnutrition. Eleanor’s nursing care was responsible for Roosevelt’s survival.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|148–151}}

===Timeline===

'''July 28:''' 
Roosevelt visited the Boy Scout Jamboree at [[Bear Mountain State Park]].

'''August 5–8:''' 
Roosevelt traveled to Campobello on board the yacht ''[[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|Sabolo]]''.

'''August 9:'''
Roosevelt fell into the cold waters of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. Later, arrived at Campobello.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|233}}

'''August 10:'''
Roosevelt spent the day physically active. Afterward, he complained of chills, nausea, and pain in his lower back. He skipped dinner and went to bed. Chills lasted through the night.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"/&gt;{{rp|252}} &lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|235}}

'''August 11:'''
In the morning, one of his legs felt weak. Roosevelt had fever.
Dr. Eben H. Bennet, a [[general practitioner]] in the nearby village of [[Lubec]] who had known the Roosevelts for years, visited Roosevelt and diagnosed a bad summer cold. By the evening, one leg was paralyzed, and the other had become weak.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|50–51}} &lt;ref name=Ditunno&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00002060-200208000-00001 |vauthors=Ditunno JF, Herbison GJ |title= Franklin D. Roosevelt: diagnosis, clinical course, and rehabilitation from poliomyelitis |journal= Am J Phys Med Rehabil |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=557–66 |year=2002 |pmid=12172063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''August 12:'''
Both legs were paralyzed. His temperature was 102&amp;nbsp;°F. Pain shot through his legs, feet and back.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51, 54}}
Bennet suggested a consultation with Dr. [[William Williams Keen|William W. Keen]], an eminent retired neurosurgeon vacationing nearby.&lt;ref name="Ditunno"/&gt;
Roosevelt's legs were numb. They then became painfully sensitive to touch. He could not pass urine.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt; By evening, his hands were affected.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

'''August 13:'''
Roosevelt was paralyzed from the chest down. On that day and the following, his hands, arms, and shoulders were weak. He had difficulty moving his bowels and required [[enema]]s.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen made what Eleanor described as "a most careful, thorough examination".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

'''August 14:'''
Roosevelt continued to be unable to pass urine for two weeks, and required [[Urinary catheterization|catheterization]]. His fever continued for a total of six to seven days.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen repeated his examination, a bending and prodding that [[Elliott Roosevelt|Elliott]] later termed "excruciating" for his father.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|58}}
Keen diagnosed a clot of blood to the lower spinal cord, and prescribed massage of the leg muscles.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt;
Eleanor and Howe began massaging Roosevelt's legs as instructed by Keen, bringing on agonizing pain.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 15:'''
Prostrate and mildly sedated, Roosevelt was occasionally delirious.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 19:'''
Frederic Delano, Roosevelt's uncle, had received a letter from Louis Howe requesting to find a doctor to come see Roosevelt. Delano called his son-in-law, a physician, who recommended he speak to another physician, a Dr. Parker. Parker told Delano that the case sounded like infantile paralysis, and that the leading authorities on the disease were at the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission in Boston. Delano caught a train and arrived the next morning.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

'''August 20:'''
Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] was at his office when Delano telephoned Brigham Hospital on Saturday morning. Levine said the senior members of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Peabody, were out of town, but he would try to answer Delano's questions. After reviewing the messages Delano had received from Campobello, Levine thought Roosevelt was suffering from acute poliomyelitis. He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64–65,327}} &lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}}
Delano phoned and wrote Eleanor the same day,&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|239}} advising her to stop massaging Roosevelt's legs, and to disregard Keen's advice: "I think it would be very unwise to trust his diagnosis where the Inf. Paralysis can be determined by test of the spinal fluid."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}
Eleanor communicated with Keen, who "very strenuously" resisted the idea of poliomyelitis. Keen asked Lovett to visit Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}

'''August 22:'''
Lovett met Levine for dinner. Lovett asked how to distinguish whether paralysis was caused by poliomyelitis or by a clot or lesion of the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

'''August 23:'''
Lovett left for Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 24:'''
Lovett saw Roosevelt and performed a "more or less superficial" examination since Roosevelt was highly sensitive to touch. The arms were weak; the bladder was paralyzed; the left thumb indicated atrophy. Roosevelt could not stand or walk, and Lovett documented "scattered weakness, most marked in the hips".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 25:'''
Roosevelt's temperature was 100&amp;nbsp;°F. Both legs were paralyzed. His back muscles were weak. There was also weakness of the face and left hand. Pain in the legs and inability to urinate continued.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}} 
After a brief conference with Keen, Lovett saw Roosevelt. Lovett informed him that the "physical findings" presented a "perfectly clear" diagnosis of poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|69–70}}
Lovett ordered an end to massage, which had no benefit and caused pain, and recommended a trained nurse to care for Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

'''September 1:'''
Roosevelt was still unable to urinate. His leg pain continued.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''September 14:'''
Roosevelt was transported to New York, by boat and train, a long and painful journey.

'''September 15:'''
Roosevelt was admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in New York City for convalescence, under the care of Dr. [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], an expert on poliomyelitis and Roosevelt's personal physician. Lovett continued to consult from Boston.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|76}}
There was pain in the legs, paralysis of the legs, muscle wasting in the lower [[lumbar]] area and the buttocks, weakness of the right triceps, and gross muscle twitching in both forearms.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

'''October 28:'''
Roosevelt was transferred from Presbyterian Hospital to his house on East 65th Street. His chart still read "not improving".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

'''Later:'''
Roosevelt exercised daily. His hamstrings tightened, and his legs were encased in plaster to straighten them by degrees.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|238}}
There was gradual recovery, but he remained paralyzed from the waist down.

=== Diagnosis ===
After falling ill, Roosevelt was seen by four doctors. [[Eben Homer Bennet]], the Roosevelt family doctor, diagnosed a heavy cold. [[William Williams Keen|William Keen]], a retired neurosurgeon, thought Roosevelt had a blood clot. [[Robert Lovett (physician)|Robert Lovett]], an expert on the orthopedic management of children paralyzed from poliomyelitis, diagnosed "infantile paralysis", as did [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], Roosevelt's personal physician.

Roosevelt's physicians never mentioned [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, indicating that they were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|204}} All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|203}} In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

=== Warm Springs ===
[[File:FDR-and-three-polio-patients-Warm-Springs-1925.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt with polio patients in Warm Springs, Georgia (1925)]]
Roosevelt first traveled to [[Warm Springs Historic District|Warm Springs]], Georgia, on October 3, 1924. For many years to come Warm Springs would be where he would retreat in comfort for [[hydrotherapy]]. On April 29, 1926, he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"&gt;{{Cite book |title=FDR’s Splendid Deception |last=Gallagher |first=Hugh |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, Inc |year=1985 |isbn=0918339502 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}} One of Roosevelt's primary goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|222–226}}

=== Governor and President ===
In 1929 Roosevelt was elected Governor of New York and moved into the Governor's Mansion in Albany. Before he moved in, the mansion was made wheelchair-friendly with ramps and an elevator.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|68–87}}

Roosevelt won the Presidential election in 1932 in a landslide victory and became the first, and so far only, disabled person to be President of the United States. Before he moved into the White House, ramps were added to make it wheelchair-friendly. Any pictures of the President were taken at certain angles and at a distance.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|88–105}}

==Efforts to rehabilitate==
[[File:FDR-Pool-Warm-Springs-1929.jpg|right|thumb|Roosevelt at Warm Springs (1929)]]
Roosevelt was totally and permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"/&gt;  For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/from-the-castle-fdrs-stamps-144524734/?no-ist |title=From the Castle - FDR's Stamps |author=G. Wayne Clough |magazine=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him to determine the extent of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another.&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"/&gt; He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood]], he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|241}}

In October 1922, Roosevelt visited his law office at the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]], where a welcome-back luncheon had been arranged. The chauffeur assisting him failed to brace the tip of his left crutch and Roosevelt fell onto the highly polished lobby floor. Laughing, he asked two young men in the crowd of onlookers to help get him back on his feet. After the luncheon, he told friends it was a "grand and glorious occasion". He did not return to his office for two months.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Geoffrey C. |authorlink1=Geoffrey Ward |last2=Burns |first2=Ken |authorlink2=Ken Burns |date=2014 |title=The Roosevelts: An Intimate History |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |isbn=9780307700230}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}}

Roosevelt believed that warmth and exercise would help rebuild his legs. He bought a run-down 71-foot houseboat and, in February 1923, sailed to Florida with friends and a small crew. Eleanor found it dull and left, but Roosevelt sailed for weeks, fishing and spending time with a succession of friends who came to visit. He designed a pulley system that lowered him into the water to swim. In May 1923, Lovett documented no overall improvement over the preceding year, but Roosevelt would not accept his doctors' determination that further progress was unlikely. He tried a range of therapies and made two more voyages on his houseboat, but his efforts had no effect.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|247–249}}

"Between 1925 and 1928, Franklin would spend more than half his time—116 of 208 weeks—away from home, struggling to find a way to regain his feet," wrote biographer [[Geoffrey Ward]]. "Eleanor was with him just 4 of those 116 weeks, and his mother was with him for only 2. His children hardly saw him."&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Roosevelt lost the use of his legs and two inches of height, but the subsequent development of the rest of his body gave him a robust physique, and he enjoyed many years of excellent health. [[Jack Dempsey]] praised his upper-body musculature, and Roosevelt once landed a 237-pound shark after fighting it on his line for two hours.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunther |first=John |authorlink=John Gunther |date=1950 |title=Roosevelt in Retrospect |url=https://archive.org/details/rooseveltinretro00gunt |location=New York |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] |oclc=466356}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241, 266–267}}

With his physiotherapist at Warm Springs, Roosevelt laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso. For this "two-point walk", he would grip the arm of a strong person with his left hand, and brace himself with a cane in his right.

== Social impact ==
Roosevelt was the United States' first disabled president, so there has been discussion concerning how he handled his health. Disability advocate [[Hugh Gallagher (advocate)|Hugh Gallagher]] posited that Roosevelt was desperate to appear able-bodied. When discussing Roosevelt's limited use of a wheelchair in public, Gallagher stated, "This was not by accident. It was a strategy that served to minimize the extent of his handicap, to make it unnoticed when possible and palatable when it was noticed.".&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|xiv}} Historian James Tobin argued that Roosevelt used his disability to his advantage. Tobin stated, "But he could, instead, show himself to be something he had never been seen as before: a fighter and, and better yet, an underdog; not a man to pity, not a man to envy, but a man to cheer."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|273}} Despite any controversy, Roosevelt has become an inspirational figure for disabled people around the world. The [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial|Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] includes a statue of Roosevelt in a wheelchair.

Roosevelt was able to convince many people that he was getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches, Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the podium.

His public appearances were choreographed to avoid the press covering his arrival and departure, which would have shown him getting into or out of a vehicle. When possible, his vehicle was driven into a building's parking garage for his arrivals and departures.  On other occasions, the vehicle would be driven onto a ramp to avoid steps, which Roosevelt was unable to ascend.  When that was not practical, the steps would be covered with a ramp with railings, with Roosevelt using his arms to pull himself upward. When traveling by train, Roosevelt often appeared on the rear platform of the [[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|presidential railroad car]].  When he boarded or disembarked, the private car was sometimes shunted to an area of the railroad yard away from the public for reasons of security and privacy. When Roosevelt's train used a ramp and the president was on a publicly known trip, he insisted on walking on the ramp no matter how difficult.

Journalist [[John Gunther]] reported that in the 1930s he often met people in Europe, including world leaders, who were unaware of Roosevelt's paralysis.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"/&gt;{{rp|239}} [[David Brinkley]], who was a young White House reporter in World War II, stated that the Secret Service actively interfered with photographers who tried to take pictures of Roosevelt in a wheelchair or being moved about by others. The Secret Service commonly destroyed photographs they caught being taken in this manner; however, there were occasional exceptions.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/07/12/the-myth-of-fdrs-secret-disability/|title=The Myth of FDR's Secret Disability |author=Pressman, Matthew |accessdate=Aug 12, 2013 |work=Time|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748188-2,00.html | work=Time | title=THE PRESIDENCY: New Quarters | date=December 17, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT Goldberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Richard T. |date=1981 |title=The Making of Franklin D.

===March of Dimes===
{{main|March of Dimes}}

On January 3, 1938, Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt; [[Basil O'Connor]], an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation and was its president for more than three decades.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baghdady |first=Maddock J. |title=Marching to a Different Mission |journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review |year=2008 |pages=60–65 |url=http://www.ssireview.org/images/articles/2008SP_casestudy_baghdady_maddock.pdf |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's annual fundraising campaign coincided with Roosevelt's birthday on January 30. The organization initially focused on the rehabilitation of victims of paralytic polio and supported the work of [[Jonas Salk]] and others that led to the development of [[polio vaccine]]s. Today, the March of Dimes focuses on preventing premature births, congenital disabilities, and infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt;

Because he founded the March of Dimes, a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] was chosen to honor Roosevelt after his death. The [[Dime (United States coin)#Franklin D.

==Retrospective diagnosis==

===Analysis of symptoms===
A 2003 peer-reviewed study of Roosevelt's paralytic illness, using three diagnostic methods - pattern recognition, reconstructing the pathogenesis, and [[Bayesian analysis]] - favored a diagnosis of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) over poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Goldman AS, Schmalstieg EJ, Freeman DH, Goldman DA, Schmalstieg FC | title=What was the cause of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's paralytic illness? | journal=Journal of Medical Biography | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=232–40 | year=2003 | pmid=14562158 | url=http://www.ehdp.com/out/jmb_2003_v11_p232-240.pdf | doi= | accessdate=2017-07-04 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Bayesian analysis, the best estimate of the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of GBS was 1.3 per 100,000. For paralytic polio in Roosevelt's age group, an annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1.0 per 100,000 was used. The paralytic polio rate was derived from the exceptionally severe polio epidemic that struck New York City in 1916, to tilt the odds in favor of polio. The prior probability of paralytic polio in Roosevelt’s age group in the United States in 1921 was likely much lower because paralytic polio was at one of its lowest ebbs in the Northeastern region of the country at that time.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|123}} &lt;ref name="History of Vaccines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/polio |title=History of Polio |date= |website=The History of Vaccines |publisher=[[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|26}} In July 1921, three cases were reported in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 26, 1921 |title=Find Infantile Paralysis; Three Cases Develop in Paterson  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/07/26/archives/find-infantile-paralysis-three-cases-develop-in-paterson-health.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By late August some 100 cases were reported in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 23, 1921 |title=Infantile Paralysis is Spreading Up State  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/08/23/archives/infantile-paralysis-is-spreading-up-state-about-100-cases-are.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rates for GBS and paralytic polio, and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, Roosevelt's symptoms were analyzed by Bayesian analysis to obtain posterior probabilities, as listed below.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Six of eight symptoms favored GBS, with the [[posterior probability]] of GBS shown for each:
* 98% - Roosevelt’s paralysis was symmetric and ascending, and progressed more than four days, whereas the paralysis in poliomyelitis is typically asymmetric, variable in its ascent or descent, and usually progresses for only two to four days. A review of the medical research literature revealed only one report of paralytic polio with a symmetric, ascending paralysis.
* 98% - Roosevelt's numbness and [[hyperesthesia]] rarely if ever occur in paralytic polio (motor neurons affected), but are common in GBS (sensory neurons also affected).
* 98% - A consistent descending pattern of recovery from paralysis is absent in paralytic polio, but common in GBS.
* 97% - Facial paralysis, as Roosevelt had, in the absence of other cranial nerve abnormalities, is not consistent with a polio diagnosis, but is common in GBS.
* 93% - Roosevelt's prolonged bladder and bowel dysfunction are rare in paralytic polio, since polioviruses do not attack autonomic nerves, but are common in GBS.
* 93% - [[Meningismus]] (neck stiffness), a characteristic feature of paralytic polio, was absent in Roosevelt’s case.

Two of eight symptoms favored polio, with the [[posterior probability]] of polio shown for each:
* 99% - Roosevelt had fever up to 102&amp;nbsp;°F (38.9&amp;nbsp;°C), which is rare in GBS, although the pattern of the fever that Roosevelt experienced was atypical of paralytic polio.
* 72% - Roosevelt had permanent paralysis, which occurs in about 50% of paralytic polio survivors, and only about 15% of cases of GBS.

Using all eight symptoms in a Bayesian analysis, based on disease incidence rates and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, the overall probability that Roosevelt had GBS is over 99%.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|242–250}}

===When might exposure have occurred?===
It is possible Roosevelt was exposed to an infectious agent at the Boy Scout Jamboree in late July. The two-week interval before the onset of his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis,&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|13–30}} and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183}} There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', a major causative agent of GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

===Was Roosevelt predisposed to polio?===
It has been stated that Roosevelt may have been predisposed to paralytic polio by genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|40}} However, such a genetic predisposition has never been discovered.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|195}} Several authors have stated that Roosevelt was more vulnerable to polio since he was raised on an isolated family estate&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/25/247155522/roosevelts-polio-wasn-t-a-secret-he-used-it-to-his-advantage | title=Roosevelt's Polio Wasn't A Secret: He Used It To His 'Advantage' | date=November 25, 2013 |website=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had little contact with other children until he entered Groton at age 14. However, Roosevelt was not a "boy in a bubble". He had many possible exposures to polioviruses before 1921. Most polio cases are asymptomatic or a mild illness. Yet those asymptomatic individuals can transmit the viral infection.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|109}} When the prior probability of paralytic polio was artificially made 100-fold higher, to 99.4%, overall Bayesian analysis of Roosevelt's symptoms still greatly favored GBS (99.97% posterior probability). Roosevelt’s symptoms are typical of GBS, not of paralytic polio, so they overwhelm the initial prior probability.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Was a lumbar puncture done?===
A 2014 book argued that a lumbar puncture was done, based on excerpts from an "unpublished note" by Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission. The book stated, "Levine's private note indicates that Dr. Lovett did examine the cerebrospinal fluid and knew very well that a high level of white blood cells was consistent with poliomyelitis. . . . If Lovett had discovered a low white blood cell count, he would have doubted that poliomyelitis was the cause of Roosevelt's illness. Yet Lovett wrote George Draper that "I thought [the diagnosis] was perfectly clear as far as the physical findings were concerned.""&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|327–328}}

A 2017 book finally published the note. Based on the full text, the note was not found to support the idea that a spinal tap was performed, because: 
1) The note, written many years after 1921, had many errors. 
2) Levine never saw Roosevelt. 
3) Levine did not mention who did the procedure, or the results. 
4) Lovett had made it clear he would not do the procedure. 
5) None of Roosevelt's physicians at Campobello were equipped to do the procedure. 
6) "Physical findings" means information gained from a physical examination of the patient. Lovett described many "physical findings": hyperesthesia, facial paralysis, etc. But neither he, any of Roosevelt's other physicians at Campobello, Roosevelt, Eleanor, nor any of Roosevelt's associates ever said that a spinal tap was done.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Armond S. | last2=Goldman | first2=Daniel A. | date=2017 | title=Prisoners of Time: The Misdiagnosis of FDR's 1921 Illness | publisher=EHDP Press | isbn=978-1939824035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183–201}}

The 2017 book went on to say: "Given the invasive nature of a spinal tap, and the difficulty that would have occurred doing the procedure on a patient in FDR’s condition, it seems highly unlikely that a direct observer would have failed to mention anything about it. . . . Even if a spinal tap had been performed, it would have been done at the earliest about 15 days after the onset of the neurological illness, around when Lovett first saw Roosevelt. . . . One should keep in mind that the classical distinction between paralytic polio and GBS, the concentrations of leukocytes and total protein in CSF, blurs after the first several days of the onset of paralysis in both diseases."&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|193,198}}

== Could the outcome have been changed? ==
"In any event, there was no cure for either disease in 1921," [[The Defining Moment|wrote]] biographer [[Jonathan Alter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alter |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |date=2007 |title=The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=355 |isbn=9780743246019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Levine mistakenly thought that the main benefit of a spinal tap, if done, would be to improve the outcome by lowering elevated CSF pressure.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}} And even today, some authors mistakenly believe that Roosevelt's paralysis, assuming a polio diagnosis, could have been prevented with early intervention.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|45,49,62,66}} However, there is no objective evidence that a spinal tap lessens the possibility of paralysis in polio. And it is unlikely Roosevelt's physicians would have tried human serum injections into the CSF, or that such injections would have helped. Lovett did not think the injections were useful, and there were alarming meningeal symptoms associated with them, probably secondary to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|199–200}} Concerning GBS, virtually all of the effective measures that are currently standard practice for the medical management of GBS were not developed until many decades after Roosevelt's 1921 illness, so Roosevelt's prognosis would not have improved even if GBS had been diagnosed.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|238}}

'''Perspective''' in [[pharmacoeconomics]] refers to the economic vantage point of a pharmacoeconomic analysis, such as a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or [[cost-utility analysis]]. This affects the types of costs (resource expenditures) and benefits that are relevant to the analysis.

Five general perspectives are often cited in pharmacoeconomics, including institutional, third party, [[patient]], [[government]]al and [[society|societal]]. The author must state the perspective and then ensure that costs and valuations remain consistent with it throughout the study,explaining briefly the applicable nomenclature.  This should allow prospective reader to get a better understanding, and a firmer grasp of the subject matter.

If, for example, a pharmacoeconomic study takes the institutional perspective, medication cost would be relevant to resource expenditures involved in therapy delivery. Since the institution (e.g. [[hospital]]) incurs this expense, it would be included. Other relevant costs include inventory carrying cost, pharmacy time to compound or dispense, nursing time to administer, disposables (e.g. medication cups or intravenous tubing) and allocated hospital overhead costs
Valuation defines the currency reference that represents the resource expenditure associated with a given cost. The actual "dollar amount" to be attributed to the medication needs to be consistent with the perspective as well. Average wholesaler price (AWP) might not be considered an appropriate valuation of medication cost from an institutional perspective, if it does not represent the cost to the institution.  Average acquisition cost would be more relevant.

More complex perspectives may require broader consideration of costs and more sophisticated valuations. For example, in the "societal" perspective, it is necessary for the author to consider costs that would not be relevant to a given institutional perspective. Examples include lost productivity and lost wages due to illness.

'''Population health''' has been defined as "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kindig D, Stoddart G | date = March 2003 | title = What is population health? | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 380–3 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380 |pmid=12604476 | pmc=1447747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the [[health]] of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/Conference_Report.pdf Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health] held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, Knickman JR. 2002.

From a population health perspective, health has been defined not simply as a state free from disease but as "the capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes".&lt;ref&gt;Frankish, CJ et al.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81). The cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy, as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 170 --&gt;  Family planning saves lives and money by reducing [[unintended pregnancy]] and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Tsui /&gt;

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

Retrieved 12 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; PHM is distinguished from [[Disease management (health)|disease management]] by including more [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] conditions and diseases, by use of "a single point of contact and coordination", and by "[[predictive modeling]] across multiple clinical conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Rufus, and Christopher Spence.

*Coordinate effectively between care team and patient
*Track specific outcomes

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

As participation in value-based reimbursement models such as [[accountable care organization]]s (ACOs) increases, these initiatives will help drive population health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DeVore S, Champion RW |title=Driving Population Health Through Accountable Care Organizations|journal=Health Affairs |year=2011|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0935|pmid=21209436|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/1/41.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ACO model, hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks, focus on prevention, and carefully manage patients with chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Care Organizations, Explained|url = http://khn.org/news/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq/|website = Kaiser Health News|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US|date = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies have shown that inpatient admission rates have dropped over the past ten years in communities that were early adopters of the ACO model and implemented population health measures to treat "less sick" patients in the outpatient setting.&lt;ref&gt;Kutscher B.

Hospitals are finding it financially advantageous to focus on population health management and keeping people in the community well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Population Health Management: Hospitals' Changing Employer Role|url = http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce-labor-management/population-health-management-hospitals-changing-employer-role.html|website = www.beckershospitalreview.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of population health management is to improve patient outcomes and increase health capital. Other goals include preventing disease, closing care gaps, and cost savings for providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Population Health Management?|url = http://www.wellcentive.com/what-is-population-health-management/|website = Wellcentive|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, more effort has been directed towards developing telehealth services, community-based clinics in areas with high proportion of residents using the emergency department as primary care, and patient care coordinator roles to coordinate healthcare services across the care continuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The economics of health and health care (Vol. 6): Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as obesity and smoking have negative effects on health capital, while education, wage rate, and age may also impact health capital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When people are healthier through preventative care, they have the potential to live a longer and healthier life, work more and participate in the economy, and produce more based on the work done. These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

'''Postorgasmic illness syndrome''' ('''POIS''')  is a [[syndrome]] in which men have chronic physical and cognitive symptoms immediately following ejaculation in the absence of a local genital reaction.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt; The symptoms last for up to a week.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;  The cause and prevalence are unknown;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015 /&gt; it is considered a [[rare disease]].&lt;ref name=GARD /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The distinguishing characteristics of POIS are:
# the rapid onset of symptoms after ejaculation; 
# the absence of any local genital reaction; and 
# the presence of an overwhelming systemic reaction.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;

POIS symptoms, which are called a "POIS attack",&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt; can include some combination of the following: cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, severe [[myalgia|muscle pain]] throughout the body, severe [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]],  weakness, and flu-like or allergy-like symptoms,&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002 /&gt; such as sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal irritation.&lt;ref name=Balon2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wylie2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiang2015 /&gt; Additional symptoms include headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, sensory and motor problems, intense discomfort, irritability, [[anxiety]], [[gastrointestinal]] disturbances, craving for relief, susceptibility to nervous system stresses (e.g. [[common cold]]), depressed mood, and difficulty communicating, remembering words, reading and retaining information, concentrating, and socializing.&lt;ref name=Balon2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen2018" /&gt; Affected individuals may also experience intense warmth or cold.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002 /&gt;

The symptoms begin shortly after or within a half hour of [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name=Balon2005 /&gt;

The symptoms can last for several days, sometimes up to a week.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002 /&gt;

In some men, the onset of POIS is in puberty, while in others, the onset is in their twenties.{{mcn|date=January 2017}} POIS that is manifest from the first ejaculations in adolescence is called ''primary type''; POIS that starts later in life is called ''secondary type''.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;

Many POIS sufferers report lifelong [[premature ejaculation]], with [[intravaginal ejaculation latency time]] (IELT) of less than one minute.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiang2015 /&gt;

=== Synonyms and related conditions ===
POIS has been called by a number of other names, including "postejaculatory syndrome",&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002 /&gt; "postorgasm illness syndrome",&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt; "post ejaculation sickness",&lt;ref name=Goldstein2011 /&gt; and "post orgasmic sick syndrome".&lt;ref name=GARD /&gt;

[[Dhat syndrome]] is a condition, first described in 1960 in India, with symptoms similar to POIS.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt; Dhat syndrome is thought to be a [[culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound]] [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] condition and is treated with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] along with anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs.

[[Post-coital tristesse]] (PCT) is a feeling of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]] and [[anxiety]] after sexual intercourse that lasts anywhere from five minutes to two hours. PCT,  which affects both men and women, occurs only after sexual intercourse and does not require an orgasm to occur, and in that its effects are primarily emotional rather than physiological. By contrast, POIS affects only men, consists primarily of physiological symptoms that are triggered by ejaculation and that can last, in some people, for up to a week. While PCT and POIS are distinct conditions, some doctors speculate that they could be related.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;

An array of more subtle and lingering symptoms after orgasm, which do not constitute POIS, may contribute to habituation between mates. They may show up as restlessness, irritability, increased sexual frustration, apathy, sluggishness, neediness, dissatisfaction with a mate, or weepiness&lt;ref name=Burri2011 /&gt; over the days or weeks after intense sexual stimulation. Such phenomena may be part of [[mating (human)|human mating physiology]] itself.

== Mechanism ==
The cause of POIS is unknown. Some doctors hypothesize that POIS is caused by an [[autoimmunity|auto-immune reaction]]. Other doctors suspect a [[endocrine disease|hormone imbalance]] as the cause. While other causes have been proposed as well, none of the proposed causes seem to fully explain the disease.

=== Allergy hypothesis ===
According to one hypothesis, "POIS is caused by [[Type I hypersensitivity|Type-I]] and [[Type IV hypersensitivity|Type-IV]] allergy to the males' own semen".&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farley2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters2002 /&gt; Specifically, {{quote |text=Autologous seminal [[peptide]]s or peptides released from the disrupted urethral lining cells, contact the inner mucosal [[epithelium]] of the urethra. During this contact, antigen(s) of semen and / or seminal fluid is recognized and taken up by [[dendritic cell]]s in the epithelium. These cells then wander to the T-cell zones of lymph nodes, where they present the seminal fluid antigen(s) to naïve T-cells and initiate the cascade of events of a hypersensitivity reaction.{{mcn|date=January 2017}}}}

POIS could also be caused by an auto-immune reaction not to semen itself, but to another substance that is released during ejaculation, such as to [[cytokine]]s.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;

The allergy hypothesis has been disputed. According to one study, "[[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]]-mediated semen allergy in men may not be the potential mechanism of POIS".&lt;ref name=Jiang2015 /&gt; A case report considered that the skin test to autologous semen was negative.&lt;ref&gt;Negative allergy study in a case of postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS), Revista Internacional de Andrología, Nathalie Depreux, Maria Basagaña, Mariona Pascal. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.androl.2017.06.002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hormone hypothesis ===
According to another hypothesis, POIS is caused by a hormone imbalance, such as low [[progesterone]],{{mcn|date=January 2017}} low [[cortisol]], low [[testosterone]], elevated [[prolactin]], [[hypothyroidism]], or low [[DHEA]].&lt;ref name=Attia2013 /&gt;

POIS could be caused by a defect in neurosteroid precursor synthesis. In this case, the same treatment may not be effective for different sufferers. Different sufferers may have different missing precursors, ultimately leading to a deficiency of the same particular neurosteroid, causing similar symptoms.{{mcn|date=January 2017}}

=== Other possibilities ===
POIS could also be caused by [[hyperglycemia]]&lt;ref name=Attia2013 /&gt; or by chemical imbalances in the brain.&lt;ref name=Friedman2009 /&gt;

[[Virginity|Sexual activity for the first time]] may set the stage for an associated [[asthma]] attack or may aggravate pre-existing asthma. Intense emotional stimuli during sexual intercourse can lead to autonomic imbalance with parasympathetic over reactivity, thereby causing release of [[mast cell]] mediators that can provoke postcoital asthma and / or [[rhinitis]] in these patients.&lt;ref name=Shah2001 /&gt;

It is also possible that, in different individuals, the causes of POIS are different. POIS could represent "a spectrum of syndromes of differing" causes.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;

None of the currently proposed causes for POIS explain the connection between POIS and lifelong premature ejaculation.{{mcn|date=January 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
There is no generally agreed upon diagnostic criteria for POIS. One group has developed five preliminary criteria for diagnosing POIS. These are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
# one or more of the following symptoms: sensation of a flu-like state, extreme fatigue or exhaustion, weakness of musculature, experiences of feverishness or perspiration, mood disturbances and / or irritability, memory difficulties, concentration problems, incoherent speech, congestion of nose or watery nose, itching eyes;
# all symptoms occur immediately (e.g., seconds), soon (e.g., minutes), or within a few hours after ejaculation that is initiated by coitus, and / or masturbation, and / or spontaneously (e.g., during sleep); 
# symptoms occur always or nearly always, e.g., in more than 90% of ejaculation events; 
# most of these symptoms last for about 2–7 days; and 
# disappear spontaneously.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

POIS is prone to being erroneously ascribed to psychological factors such as [[hypochondriasis]] or [[somatic symptom disorder]].&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002 /&gt;

==Management==
There is no standard method of treating or managing POIS. Patients need to be thoroughly examined in an attempt to find the causes of their POIS symptoms, which are often difficult to determine, and which vary across patients. Once a cause is hypothesized, an appropriate treatment can be attempted. At times, more than one treatment is attempted, until one that works is found.

Affected individuals typically avoid sexual activity,&lt;ref name=Waldinger2002  /&gt; especially ejaculation,&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt; or schedule it for times when they can rest and recover for several days afterwards.&lt;ref name=Balon2005  /&gt; In case [[post-coital tristesse]] (PCT) is suspected, patients could be treated with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman2009 /&gt;

In one patient, the POIS symptoms were so severe, that he decided to undergo removal of the testicles, prostate, and seminal vesicles in order to relieve them. The POIS symptoms were cured by this.&lt;ref name=TLC2011 /&gt;

Another patient, in whom POIS was suspected to be caused by cytokine release, was successfully treated with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) just prior to and for a day or two after ejaculation. The patient took [[diclofenac]] 75&amp;nbsp;mg 1 to 2 hours prior to sexual activity with orgasm, and continued twice daily for 24 to 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;

One POIS patient with [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[premature ejaculation]] had much lower severity of symptoms on those occasions when he was able to maintain penile erection long enough to achieve vaginal penetration and ejaculate inside his partner. The patient took [[tadalafil]] to treat his erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. This increased the number of occasions on which he was able to ejaculate inside his partner, and decreased the number of occasions on which he experienced POIS symptoms. This patient is thought to have [[Dhat syndrome]] rather than true POIS.&lt;ref name=Ashby2010 /&gt;

Two patients, in whom POIS was suspected to be caused by auto-immune reaction to their own semen, were successfully treated by [[allergen immunotherapy]] with their own autologous semen. They were given multiple subcutaneous injections of their own semen for three years.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt; Treatment with autologous semen "might take 3 to 5 years before any clinically relevant symptom reduction would become manifest".&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt; A case report used a technique known as "Intralymphatic Immunotherapy", the treatment has been successful in improving 60-90% of symptoms. The patient received only five injections of the autologous semen using this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Tae Beom|last2=Shim|first2=Young Sup|last3=Lee|first3=Sang Min|last4=Son|first4=Eun Suk|last5=Shim|first5=Jung Woo|last6=Lee|first6=Sang Pyo|display-authors=1|title=Intralymphatic Immunotherapy With Autologous Semen in a Korean Man With Post-Orgasmic Illness Syndrome|journal=Sexual Medicine|date=March 2018|doi=10.1016/j.esxm.2017.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatments are not always successful, especially when the cause of POIS in a particular patient has not been determined. In one patient, all of whose [[medical laboratory|routine laboratory tests]] were normal, the following were attempted, all without success: [[ibuprofen]], 400&amp;nbsp;mg on demand; [[tramadol]] 50&amp;nbsp;mg one hour pre-coitally; and [[escitalopram]] 10&amp;nbsp;mg daily at bedtime for 3 months.&lt;ref name=Attia2013 /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of POIS is unknown.&lt;ref name=Wylie2015 /&gt; POIS is listed as a [[rare disease]] by the American [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;ref name=GARD /&gt; and the European [[Orphanet]].&lt;ref name=orpha /&gt; It is thought to be underdiagnosed and underreported.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2018" /&gt;

===Women===
It is possible that a similar disease exists in women, though, as of 2016, there is only one documented female patient.&lt;ref name=Waldinger2016 /&gt;

A '''postpartum (or postnatal) period''' begins immediately after the [[childbirth|birth of a child]] as the mother's body, including [[hormone]] levels and [[uterus]] size, returns to a non-pregnant state.&lt;ref name="Kansky_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Christine | last = Kansky | name-list-format = vanc | date = July 2016 | title  =Normal and Abnormal Puerperium: Overview, Routine Postpartum Care, Hemorrhage|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/260187-overview |publisher = Medscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms '''puerperium''' or '''puerperal period''', or '''immediate postpartum period''' are commonly used to refer to the first 6 weeks following childbirth.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cacciatore A, Giordano R, La Rosa B | title = Postpartum period: three distinct but continuous phases | journal = Journal of Prenatal Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 22–5 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 22439056 | pmc = 3279173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most maternal and/or newborn deaths occur during the postnatal period.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=WHO | access-date=22 December 2014 | author=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific literature, the term is commonly abbreviated to '''P''x''''', where '''''x''''' is a number; for example, "day P5" should be read as "the fifth day after birth". This is not to be confused with the medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number and outcomes of pregnancy ([[gravidity and parity]]).

A woman giving birth in a hospital may leave as soon as she is medically stable, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for [[spontaneous vaginal delivery|a vaginal birth]] is one to two days. The average [[caesarean section]] postnatal stay is three to four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recovering from a caesarean section|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/Pages/Recovery.aspx|website=NHS Choices|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the mother is monitored for bleeding, bowel and bladder function, and baby care.

The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, 6–12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts 2–6 weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="Glazener_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazener CM, Abdalla M, Stroud P, Naji S, Templeton A, Russell IT | title = Postnatal maternal morbidity: extent, causes, prevention and treatment | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–7 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7612509 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1995.tb09132.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Roberts CL, Currie M, Ellwood DA | title = Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth | journal = Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12051189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borders N | title = After the afterbirth: a critical review of postpartum health relative to method of delivery | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–248 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16814217 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acute phase ==
[[File:Postpartum_baby2.jpg|thumb|Infant placed directly on the chest following childbirth]]
[[File:Front View of Postpartum Uterine Massage.png|thumb|Postpartum uterine massage helps the uterus to contract after the placenta has been expelled in the acute phase.]]
The first 6 to 12 hours after childbirth is the initial or acute phase of the postpartum period.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; During this time the mother is typically monitored by nurses or midwives as complications can arise in this period.

The greatest health risk in the acute phase is [[postpartum bleeding]]. Following delivery the area where the placenta was attached to the uterine wall bleeds, and the uterus must contract to prevent blood loss. After contraction takes place the fundus (top) of the uterus can be palpated as a firm mass at the level of the navel. It is important that the uterus remains firm and the nurse or midwife will make frequent assessments of both the fundus and the amount of bleeding. Uterine massage is commonly used to help the uterus contract.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic" /&gt;

Following delivery if the mother had an [[episiotomy]] or tearing at the opening of the vagina, it is stitched.  At one time an episiotomy was routine, however more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.  A healthcare professional can recommend comfort measures to help to ease [[Perineum|perineal]] pain&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/episiotomy/ART-20047282?p=1 | title=Labor and delivery, postpartum care | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=30 July 2015 | access-date=15 August 2015 | author=Mayo Clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant caring in the acute phase ===
[[File:A few moments more.jpg|thumb|Infant nursing shortly after birth]]
Within about 10 seconds the infant takes its first breath and the caregiver places the baby on the mother's chest.  The infant's condition is evaluated using the [[Apgar scale]].  The 
Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five criteria which are summarized using words chosen to form a [[backronym]] ('''A'''ppearance, '''P'''ulse, '''G'''rimace, '''A'''ctivity, '''R'''espiration). Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact, also called [[kangaroo care]], is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants. Thus, to help establish bonding and successful [[breastfeeding]], the caregiver carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother's chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.  The [[World Health Organization]]  (WHO) also encourages skin-to-skin contact for the first 24 hours after birth to help regulate the baby's temperature.&lt;ref name="Medscape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9|title=Uninterrupted Skin-to-Skin Contact Immediately After Birth| last = Phillips | first = Raylene | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Medscape | access-date = 21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subacute postpartum period ==
The subacute postpartum starts after the acute postpatrum period concludes and can last for 2–6 weeks.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt;

=== Physical recovery in the subacute postpartum period ===
In the first few days following childbirth, the risk of [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]] is relatively high as [[Hypercoagulability in pregnancy|hypercoagulability increases during pregnancy]] and is maximal in the postpartum period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiengo L, Bucci F, Patrizi G, Giannotti D, Redler A | title = Postpartum deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in twin pregnancy: undertaking of clinical symptoms leading to massive complications | journal = Thrombosis Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23433174 | pmc = 3629711 | doi = 10.1186/1477-9560-11-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for women with C-section with reduced mobility. [[Anticoagulant|Anti-coagulants]] may be prescribed or physical methods such as [[Compression stockings|compression]] are commonly indicated to decrease the risk of DVT.

The increased [[vascularity]] and [[edema]] of the woman's vagina gradually resolves in about three weeks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[cervix]] gradually narrows and lengths over a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/Article?contentid=415&amp;language=English|title=Childbirth recovery and postpartum care|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aboutkidshealth.ca|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postpartum infections]] can lead to [[sepsis]] and if untreated, death.&lt;ref name="WHO postnatal care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=World Health Organization | date=2013 | access-date=22 December 2014 | author=WHO | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222172315/http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | archive-date=22 December 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum [[urinary incontinence]] is experienced by about 33% of all women; women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a cesarean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom DH, Rortveit G | title = Prevalence of postpartum urinary incontinence: a systematic review | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 1511–22 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21050146 | doi = 10.3109/00016349.2010.526188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary incontinence in this period increases the risk of long term incontinence.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt;
[[File:Adult diapers in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|Adult diapers may be worn in the subacute postpartum period for lochia, as well as urinary and fecal incontinence.]]
Discharge from the uterus, called [[lochia]], will gradually decrease and turn from bright red, to brownish, to yellow and cease at around five or six weeks. Women are advised in this period to wear [[adult diaper]]s or nappies, [[disposable maternity briefs]], maternity pads or towels, or [[sanitary napkin]]s. The use of [[tampon]]s or [[menstrual cup]]s are contraindicated as they may introduce bacteria and increase the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/2511.aspx?CategoryID=60|title=How soon can I use tampons after giving birth?|last=N.

[[Hemorrhoid]]s and [[constipation]] in this period are common, and [[Laxative|stool softeners]] are routinely given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-hemorrhoids_11708.bc|title=Postpartum Hemmorhoids|last=|first=|date=|website=Baby Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="Glazener_1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson_2002" /&gt;

=== Infant caring in the subacute period ===
At 2–4 days postpartum, a woman's milk will generally come in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/breastfeeding-first-days/|title=Breastfeeding: the first few days|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, women who were not breastfeeding were given drugs to [[Lactation suppression|suppress lactation]], but this is no longer medically indicated. In this period, [[Breastfeeding difficulties|difficulties with breastfeeding]] may arise. Maternal sleep is often disturbed as night waking is normal in the newborn, and newborns need to be fed every two hours, including during the night.&lt;ref name="McGuire_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGuire E | title = Maternal and infant sleep postpartum | journal = Breastfeeding Review | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 38–41 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23957180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lactation consultant]] and [[health visitor]] may be of assistance at this time.

===Psychological disorders===
{{See also|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth}}During the subacute postpartum period, psychological disorders may emerge. Among these are [[postpartum depression]], [[Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder]], and in rare cases, [[puerperal psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobson V, Sales B | year=2000|title=The Science of Infanticide and Mental Illness|url=|journal=Psychology, Public Policy and Law|location=|publisher=|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1098–1112|doi=10.1037/1076-8971.6.4.1098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum mental illness can affect both mothers and fathers, and is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmha.ca/mental_health/postpartum-depression/|title=Postpartum Depression|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Mental Health Association|publisher=|access-date=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early detection and adequate treatment is required. Approximately 25% – 85% of postpartum women will experience the "blues" for a few days. Between 7% and 17% may experience clinical depression, with a higher risk among those women with a history of clinical depression.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8 and 5.6% at 6 weeks postpartum.&lt;ref name="Olde_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olde E, van der Hart O, Kleber R, van Son M | title = Posttraumatic stress following childbirth: a review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16176853 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Delayed postpartum period ==
The delayed postpartum period starts after the subacute postpartum period and lasts up to 6 months.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; During this time, muscles and connective tissue returns to a pre-pregnancy state. Recovery from childbirth complications in this period, such as [[Urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]], [[Dyspareunia|painful intercourse]], and [[Pelvic organ prolapse|pelvic prolapse]], are typically very slow and in some cases may not resolve.&lt;ref name="Romano_2010" /&gt; Symptoms of [[Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] often subside in this period, dropping from 2.8 and 5.6% at 6 weeks postpartum to 1.5% at 6 months postpartum.&lt;ref name="Olde_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alder2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alder J, Stadlmayr W, Tschudin S, Bitzer J | title = Post-traumatic symptoms after childbirth: what should we offer? | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–12 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16808085 | doi = 10.1080/01674820600714632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately three months after giving birth (typically between 2 and 5 months), [[estrogen]] levels drop and large amounts of [[Hair loss#Pregnancy|hair loss]] is common, particularly in the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] area (postpartum alopecia). Hair typically grows back normally and treatment is not indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHIFF|first=BENCEL L.|date=1963-05-01|title=Study of Postpartum Alopecia|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/527997|journal=Archives of Dermatology|language=en|volume=87|issue=5|pages=609|doi=10.1001/archderm.1963.01590170067011|issn=0003-987X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eastham|first=John H|date=February 2001|title=Postpartum Alopecia|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1345/aph.10153|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|volume=35|pages=255–258|doi=10.1345/1542-6270(2001)035&lt;0255:pa&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=1060-0280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions that may arise in this period include [[postpartum thyroiditis]].

During this period, infant sleep during the night gradually increases and maternal sleep generally improves.&lt;ref name="McGuire_2013" /&gt;

Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders_2006" /&gt;

==Cultures==
{{Main|Postpartum confinement}}
[[File:4 Master of Charles of Durazzo (Francesco di Michele) A Birth Scene (Desco da Parte), c. 1410 Harvard Art museum (2).jpg|thumb|A mother in [[Florence]] [[lying-in]], from a painted [[desco da parto]] or birth tray of c. 1410. As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving.]]

Postpartum confinement refers to a system for recovery following childbirth. It begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days,&lt;ref name="Chien_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chien YC, Huang YJ, Hsu CS, Chao JC, Liu JF | title = Maternal lactation characteristics after consumption of an alcoholic soup during the postpartum 'doing-the-month' ritual | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 382–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 18426631 | doi = 10.1017/S1368980008002152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; up to 40 days, two months or 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/a1021145/confinement-practices-an-overview|title=Confinement practices: an overview|website=BabyCenter|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postnatal recuperation can include "traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tung|first1=Wei-Chen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Doing the Month and Asian Cultures: Implications for Health Care|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=22 June 2010|volume=22|issue=5|pages=369–371|doi=10.1177/1084822310367473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice used to be known as "[[lying-in]]", which, as the term suggests, centres around [[bed rest]]. ([[Maternity hospital]]s used to use this phrase, as in the [[General Lying-in Hospital]].) Postpartum confinement customs are well-documented in China, where it is known as "Sitting the month", and similar customs manifest all over the world. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labour and delivery.{{Nonspecific|date=August 2018}}

In other cultures like in South Korea, a great level of importance is placed on postnatal care. [[Sanhujori]] is the term for traditional postnatal care in Korea and is a practice followed by the majority of women for the purpose of proper recovery after giving birth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Eun Kwang|last2=Jung|first2=Eun Sil|date=2016|title=Outlook of sanhujori from Korean women residing in the US|url=http://onlinepresent.org/proceedings/vol128_2016/39.pdf|journal=Advanced Science and Technology Letters|volume=128|pages=203-207|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Deeply rooted in Korean culture, sanhujori has similarly evolved with today’s society from being heavily reliant on the mothers’ family members to include services that encompass its principles, which is apparent with the over 500 sanhujori centers in operation around Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Eun Kwang|last2=Kim|first2=Hye Jin|date=2016|title=Unmarried Single Women’s Awareness of Sanhujori|url=http://onlinepresent.org/proceedings/vol128_2016/35.pdf|journal=Advanced Science and Technology Letters|volume=128|pages=183-187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''psychiatric interview''' refers to the set of tools that a mental health worker (most times a psychiatrist or a psychologist but at times social workers or nurses) uses to complete a [[psychiatric assessment]].

The goals of the psychiatric interview are:
*Build [[rapport]].
*Collect data about the patient's current difficulties, past [[psychiatric history]] and [[medical history]], as well as relevant developmental, interpersonal and social history.
*Diagnose the [[mental health]] issue(s).
*Understand the patient's [[Personality psychology|personality]] structure, use of [[defense mechanisms]] and [[coping strategies]].
*Improve the patient's [[insight]].
*Create a foundation for a [[therapeutic alliance]].
*Foster healing.

The data collected through the psychiatric interview is mostly subjective, based on the patient's report, and many times can not be corroborated by objective measurements. As such, one the interview's goals is to collect data that is both valid and reliable. 

[[Validity (logic)|Validity]] refers to how the data compares to an ideal absolute truth that the interviewer needs to access and uncover. Challenges that might affect the interview validity include can be categorized as patient related factors and interviewer related factors. Patient's related factors include:
*Shame: the patient might feel ashamed to discuss some of his difficulties.
*Fear of being judged: while not ashamed the patient might be reluctant to discuss some of the issues that she thinks that she can be judged for.
*Lack of awareness: patient might have distorted recollection of past events with significant emotional valence.
*Cognitive deficits: the patient might have a memory deficit that might impair his ability to correctly recall past events.
*[[Secondary gain]]: the patient decided to misrepresent fact in order to gain a certain benefit (e.g. disability benefits) or avoid a certain penalty (e.g. [[insanity defense]]).
Interviewer related factors include:
*Powerful feelings of like or dislike that might affect the interviewer objectivity.
*Lack of experience: the interviewer lack the skills and knowledge necessary to explore a specific area of pathology.
*[[Diagnostic bias]]: the interviewer is invested in a specific psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. same patient might be diagnosed with schizophrenia by a schizophrenia researcher or bipolar disorder with psychotic features by a bipolar disorder researcher).

[[Reliability (statistics)|Reliability]] refers to how datasets collected by different interviewers or the same interview at different times compare with one another. Ideal reliability is when a dataset will be stable irrespective of changes in specifics of the data collection. 

Different interview techniques have been shown to result in variations in the validity and reliability of the collected data.  Open-ended question ("Tell me about your sleep.") have been shown to have better validity but less reliability than closed-ended questions("Do you have sleeping difficulties?")

In [[pregnancy]] terms, '''quickening''' is the moment in [[pregnancy]] when the pregnant woman starts to feel or perceive [[fetal movement]]s in the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Quickening Quickening in Farlex dictionary], in turn citing The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. copyright 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical facts==
The first natural sensation of quickening may feel like a light tapping, or the fluttering of a butterfly.  These sensations eventually become stronger and more regular as the pregnancy progresses.  Sometimes, the first movements are mis-attributed to gas or hunger pangs.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, Roger. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060746378&amp;id=s-7d20ulE8UC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;ots=cLn4PQ44f0&amp;dq=%22Mayo+Clinic%22+and+quickening&amp;sig=KJyaqcmu-BeNXCMHhrdzIGkwzWc Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy]'', page 480 (HarperCollins 2004). Retrieved 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman's [[uterus|uterine]] muscles, rather than her [[abdomen|abdominal]] muscles, are first to sense fetal motion.  Therefore, a woman's body weight usually does not have a substantial effect on when movements are initially perceived.  Women who have already given birth have more relaxed uterine muscles that are consequently more sensitive to fetal motion, and for them fetal motion can sometimes be felt as early as 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Ziel, Cornelia &amp; Tourville, Jacqueline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1569243190&amp;id=jciZAfJWoqsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA70&amp;lpg=RA1-PA70&amp;ots=RD_hiLptXz&amp;dq=quickening+and+%22plus-size%22&amp;sig=S9lPp8zEcLGW3cyEnCouefDFZxI Big, Beautiful &amp; Pregnant: Expert Advice And Comforting Wisdom for the Expecting Plus-size Woman]'' (Marlowe 2006).

Usually, quickening occurs naturally at about the middle of a pregnancy. A woman pregnant for the first time (i.e., a [[Glossary of terms associated with gravidity|primigravida]] woman) typically feels fetal movements at about 18–20 weeks, whereas a woman who has been pregnant more than once (i.e., a multipara woman) will typically feel movements around 15–17 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Malcolm et al.

==Legal history==
{{see also|History of abortion law debate}}

The word "quick" [[wiktionary:quick#Adjective|originally meant]] "alive".  Historically, quickening has sometimes been considered to be the beginning of the possession of "individual life" by the fetus.  British legal scholar [[William Blackstone]] explained the subject of quickening in the eighteenth century, relative to [[feticide]] and [[abortion]]:

{{quote|Life... begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb. For if a woman is ''quick'' with child, and by a potion, or otherwise, killeth it in her womb; or if any one beat her, whereby the child dieth in her body, and she is delivered of a dead child; this, though not murder, was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter. But at present it is not looked upon in quite so atrocious a light, though it remains a very heinous misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Blackstone |authorlink=William Blackstone |chapter=Amendment IX, Document 1 |chapterurl=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs1.html |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] |origyear=1765 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |volume=5 |page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, quickening was only one of several standards that were used historically to determine when the [[right to life]] attaches to a fetus.  According to the "ancient law" mentioned by Blackstone, another standard was [[formation of the fetus]], which occurs weeks before quickening.  [[Henry de Bracton]] explained the ancient law, about five hundred years before Blackstone:

{{quote|If one strikes a pregnant woman or gives her poison in order to procure an abortion, if the fetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened, he commits homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Henry de Bracton]] |chapter=The crime of homicide and the divisions into which it falls |editor=George E. Woodbine ed.; Samuel Edmund Thorne trans. |title=On the Laws and Customs of England |origyear=c. 1250 |year=1968 |volume=2 |page=[http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/bracton/Unframed/English/v2/341.htm 341] |oclc=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a woman convicted of a capital crime could claim a delay in her execution if she were pregnant; a woman who did so was said to "[[plead the belly]]". In Ireland on 16 March 1831 Baron Pennefather in Limerick stated that pregnancy was not alone sufficient for a delay but there had to be quickening.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Evening Post'' and ''Clare Sentinel'', 18 March 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Race}}

'''Race and health''' refers to the relationship between individual [[health]] and one's [[race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Differences in health status, health outcomes, [[life expectancy]], and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups are well documented, and referred to as racial [[health disparities]]. Some individuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less access to resources, and live shorter lives in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Race is a complex concept, and the two major competing theories of race use biological definitions and social construction to define racial difference. A "race" is also viewed as physically distinguishable populations that share a common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalter-Roth |first1=Roberta |title=Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans |website=asanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include but are not limited to ancestry, social [[Identity (social science)|identity]], visible [[phenotype]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=171|author=National Human Genome Research Institute|title=Race|work=Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;[[World Health Organization]]. [http://www.who.int/hia/evidence/doh/en/ ''The determinants of health'']. Geneva. Accessed 12 May 2011 (which are inter-related with all three, but mostly social factors).&lt;/ref&gt; Race and medicine are related additionally by how environmental factors and physiological factors respond to each other. Additionally, how genetic needs coerce with environmental standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1047-2797(97)00051-3 |pmid=9250627 |title=Race and health: Basic questions, emerging directions |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=322–33 |year=1997 |last1=Williams |first1=David R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health disparities ==
Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and [[health care]] across racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley |date=November 2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010615/http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Collins |first=Francis S. |title=What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=36 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S13–S15 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15507997 |doi=10.1038/ng1436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How researchers view race is often linked to how we address racial disparities because the national administrator of health uses these research findings to implement policies.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/reserves/pdffiles/34469_Whitmarsh_Vernaculars.pdf|title=Brown University Authentication for Web-Based Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining race ==
{{main|Race (human categorization)}}

There are various paradigms used to discuss race, including biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.&lt;ref name="library.brown.edu"/&gt; The terms race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race.

Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, aka use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences".&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference|chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race|author=Ann Morning|p=114|year=2011|publisher= University of California Press |doi=10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social definitions are commonly constructionist. Racial groups are "constructed" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.&lt;ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"/&gt;

Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social interpretations of race]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&amp;%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.

==Race and disease==
There are a myriad of factors that affect health disparities between racial groups. Among these factors are genetic differences within racial populations, cultural [[mores]], and social and environmental factors. For instance, in some populations where perceptions of race are linked with socioeconomic disparities and differences, the access to care can be considerably lesser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=D R|last2=Lavizzo-Mourey|first2=R|last3=Warren|first3=R C|date=1994-01-01|title=The concept of race and health status in America.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=109|issue=1|pages=26–41|issn=0033-3549|pmc=1402239|pmid=8303011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dually, bias in healthcare systems themselves can perpetuate non-biologically founded higher instances of disease. A study conducted by the [[National Health Service]] checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that "the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Ruth|last2=Coghill|first2=Nikki|last3=Montgomery|first3=Alan|last4=Feder|first4=Gene|last5=Horwood|first5=Jeremy|date=2015-12-10|title=The provision of NHS health checks in a community setting: an ethnographic account|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=15|pages=546|doi=10.1186/s12913-015-1209-1|issn=1472-6963|pmc=4676171|pmid=26651487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses. These linkages should be more closely evaluated than by ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=Carol R.|last2=Davis|first2=Margaret H.|last3=Palermo|first3=Ann-Gel S.|last4=Vladeck|first4=Bruce C.|date=2000-01-01|title=Approaches to Eliminating Sociocultural Disparities in Health|journal=Health Care Financing Review|volume=21|issue=4|pages=57–74|issn=0195-8631|pmc=4194638|pmid=11481745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, health disparities, which include variations in life expectancy and prevalence of disease, due to the differences in health conditions across various ethnic populations that can be attributed to inequalities in living environment and access to healthcare may also play a role.

===Single-gene disorders===
{{See also|Genetic disorder}}
There are many single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region, though many assume it to be solely based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Goldstein|first2=DB|last3=Angrist|first3=M|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G|title=Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581|pmid=25059740|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581|pmc=4143101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Cystic fibrosis]], the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of Northern European heritage
*[[Sickle-cell anemia]], most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin-American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/posters/chromosome/sca.shtml|title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Miriam. ''Understanding Sickle Cell Disease.'' University Press of Mississippi, 1995. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thalassemia]], most prevalent in populations having Mediterranean ancestry, to the point that the disease's name is derived from Greek ''thalasson'', "sea"
*[[Tay–Sachs disease]], an autosomal recessive disorder more frequent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] than among other Jewish groups and non-Jewish populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5945951 | last1 = Myrianthopoulos  |name-list-format=vanc| first1 = NC | last2 = Aronson | first2 = SM | title = Population dynamics of Tay-Sachs disease.

*[[Hereditary hemochromatosis]], most common among persons having Northern European ancestry, in particular those people of Celtic descent
*[[Lactose intolerance]] affects (over their lifetime) as many as 25% of Europeans but up to 50-80% of Hispanics, along with Ashkenazi Jews, but nearly 100% of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Shinjini | last1=Bhatnagar | first2=Rakesh | last2=Aggarwal  | journal=British Medical Journal| year=2007 | pages=1331–1332 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39252.524375.80 | volume=334 | issue=7608 | title=Lactose intolerance | pmid=17599979 | pmc=1906652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. "Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|title=Definitions of Risk|journal=Journal of Dental Education|date=October 1, 2001|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1007–8 |author=Brian A. Burt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003820/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf|archivedate=October 31, 2004|pmid=11699970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index3.html|title=WHO - Genes and human disease|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations are considered "high-risk" or "low-risk" groups for various diseases due to the probability of that particular population being more exposed to certain risk factors. Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases.

===Disease progression===
Groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Black men who were diagnosed with HIV generally fared worse than their white and Hispanic counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=2007|title=Racial/ethnic and age disparities in HIV prevalence and disease progression among men who have sex with men in the United States|url=|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1060–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.087551|pmc=1874211|pmid=17463370|author1=Hall HI|author2=Byers RH|author3=Ling Q|author4=Espinoza L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of men studied with very low CD4+ T-cell count, defined as fewer than 50 cells per microliter, at AIDS diagnosis was 24.1% for white men, 27.8% for Hispanic men, and 34.4% for Black men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black men were also significantly less likely to be alive three years after diagnosis (80.6%) than Hispanic or white men, who had 85.2% and 84.5% survival rates, respectively. However, the reasons for these differences are not clear, and should not be understood as an essential difference between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Prevention===
Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=Lyla M.|last2=Blazer|first2=Dan G.|last3=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assessing Interactions Among Social|first3=Behavioral|date=2006-01-01|title=Genetics and Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19932/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geneticists have been able to determine that "[[human genetic variation]] is geographically structured".  The different geographic regions correlate with different races,&lt;ref name=pmid15508000&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorde|first=Lynn B.|last2=Wooding|first2=Stephen P.|date=2004-10-26|title=Genetic variation, classification and 'race' |journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=36|issue=11 Suppl|pages=S28–S33|doi=10.1038/ng1435|pmid=15508000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is logical when looking at the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|"Out of Africa" theory]] and understanding how changes in genetics of a population acquire over time.

Examples of diseases which are more common in certain racial groups are [[sickle-cell disease]] in African and Mediterranean populations, and [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] in northern European populations.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;  This information can be made available to people by their physicians, and is useful in prevention or early detection of these diseases.  For instance, a baby with sickle cell disease should be more closely monitored throughout their life than a baby without it.

While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental factors and lifestyle play a large role as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman B.|last2=Bulatao|first2=Rodolfo A.|last3=Cohen|first3=Barney|last4=National Research Council (US) Panel on Race|first4=Ethnicity|date=2004-01-01|title=Genetic Factors in Ethnic Disparities in Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it's clear that a mixture of all 3 factors are at play.  Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories.

===Race-based treatment===
{{See also|Pharmacogenomics}}
The science of 'ethnic health', or research into ethnicity and health, and the development of services which are [[Cultural competence|culturally competent]] to meet the specific health care needs of minority ethnic groups, is still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Mark | last=Johnson | contribution=Ethnicity | title=Public Health Evidence: Tackling health inequalities | editor1-first=Amanda | editor1-last=Killoran | editor2-first=Catherine| editor2-last=Swann|editor3-first=Michael P.|editor3-last=Kelly|year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198520832.do}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091021011210/http://www.omhrc.gov/ Office of Minority Health] provides useful links and supports research and development relating to the needs of America's ethnic minorities. In the United Kingdom, the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] established a specialist collection on Ethnicity &amp; Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Evidence - ethnicity and health|url=http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324235329/http://www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity/|archivedate=2007-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resource was supported by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) as part of the UK NHS Evidence initiative [[NHS Evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NHS Evidence]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, there are growing numbers of resource and research centers which are seeking to provide this service for other national settings, such as [http://mmha.org.au/ Multicultural Mental Health Australia].

"Race-based medicine" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific ethnic clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = AL | last2 = Ziesche | first2 = S | last3 = Yancy | first3 = C |name-list-format=vanc| last4 = Carson | first4 = P | last5 = D'agostino Jr | first5 = R | last6 = Ferdinand | first6 = K | last7 = Taylor | first7 = M | last8 = Adams | first8 = K | last9 = Sabolinski | first9 = M| last10 = Worcel | first10 = Manuel | last11 = Cohn | first11 = Jay N. | date = November 2004 | title=Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 20| pages = 2049–57 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934 | pmid = 15533851 | display-authors = 8 | author12 = African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Exner | first1 = DV | last2 = Dries | first2 = DL | last3 = Domanski | first3 = MJ | last4 = Cohn | first4 = JN |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2001 | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in blacks as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 344 | issue = 18| pages = 1351–7 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 | pmid = 11333991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00181.x |title=Medicine in black and white: BiDil®: race and the limits of evidence‐based medicine |journal=Significance |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=2006 |last1=Ellison |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored.

An alternative to "race-based medicine" is personalized medicine that involves identifying genetic, genomic (i.e., genomic sequencing), and clinical information—as opposed to using race as a proxy for these data—to better predict a patient's predisposition to certain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-conditions/cancer/personalized-medicine#2|title=2.

==Environmental factors==

A positive correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in [[health]]. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that [[Minority group|minorities]] in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets.&lt;ref name="Suarez 912–920"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Isakova|first2=Tamara|last3=Anderson|first3=Cheryl A.

Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angkurawaranon|first=Chaisiri|last2=Wisetborisut|first2=Anawat|last3=Rerkasem|first3=Kittipan|last4=Seubsman|first4=Sam-ang|last5=Sleigh|first5=Adrian|last6=Doyle|first6=Pat|last7=Nitsch|first7=Dorothea|date=2015-09-16|title=Early life urban exposure as a risk factor for developing obesity and impaired fasting glucose in later adulthood: results from two cohorts in Thailand|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=15 |pages=902|doi=10.1186/s12889-015-2220-5|issn=1471-2458|pmc=4572635|pmid=26376960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food.  Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet;  this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from [[Cyprus]], a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazarou|first=Chrystalleni|last2=Kalavana|first2=Theano|date=2009-01-01|title=Urbanization influences dietary habits of Cypriot children: the CYKIDS study|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=54|issue=2|pages=69–77|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-8054-0|issn=1661-8564|pmid=19234670}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.

==Genetic factors==
The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more.

A phenotype is the "outward, physical manifestation" of an organism."&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html|title=Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the "internally coded, inheritable information" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA&lt;ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"/&gt;

For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals "may be due to differences in the genes" coding for a trait or "the result of variation in environmental condition". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/heritability/heritability.htm|title=Estimating additive genetic variation and heritability of phenotypic traits|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For humans, there is "more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups".&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt; In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-9063-3_14 |chapter=The Apportionment of Human Diversity |title=Evolutionary Biology |pages=381–98 |year=1972 |last1=Lewontin |first1=R.

Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria and the Red Cell|publisher=Harvard University|year=2002|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127201806/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|archivedate=2011-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic fibrosis#Theories about prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research, a common theory was the "[[common disease-common variant]]" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McClellan | first1 = J. | last2 = King | first2 = M.

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schork|first=N.J|year=2009|title=Common vs. rare allele hypotheses for complex diseases|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=19|issue=3|pages=212–219|via=|pmid=19481926|pmc=2914559|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2009.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model may be relevant for diseases that reduces fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krausz|first=C|year=2015|title=Genetics of male infertility: From research to clinic|journal=Reproduction|volume=150|issue=5|pages=R159–R174|via=|pmid=26447148|doi= 10.1530/REP-15-0261|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/150/5/R159.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist they must either have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like [[Alzheimer's disease]]) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities.&lt;ref name=pmid20403315/&gt; Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[type 2 diabetes]] appear to adhere to "common disease-common variant" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohmueller KE, Pearce CL, Pike M, Lander ES, Hirschhorn JN | year = 2003 | title = Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of common variants to susceptibility to common disease | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 177–182 | doi = 10.1038/ng1071 | pmid = 12524541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15596747  |name-list-format=vanc| last1 = Cree | first1 = BA | last2 = Khan | first2 = O | last3 = Bourdette | first3 = D | last4 = Goodin | first4 = DS | last5 = Cohen | first5 = JA | last6 = Marrie | first6 = RA | last7 = Glidden | first7 = D | last8 = Weinstock-Guttman | first8 = B | last9 = Reich | first9 = D | last10 =Patterson | first10 =N. | last11 =Haines | first11 =J.

Some diseases and physiological variables vary depending upon their admixture ratios. Examples include measures of [[insulin]] functioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gower B. A.| year = 2003 | title = Using genetic admixture to explain racial differences in insulin-related phenotypes | url = | journal = Diabetes | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1047–1051 | doi=10.2337/diabetes.52.4.1047|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernandez J.

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&amp;ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.&lt;ref name=gonz1996&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gonzalez E, etal | year = 1999 | title = Race-specific HIV-1 disease-modifying effects associated with CCR5 haplotypes | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.21.12004 | journal = Proc.

==Controversy==
{{See also|Race (classification of humans)|Race and genetics}}

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzig|first=Ritchie|date=1996-10-15|title=The Medicalization of Race: Scientific Legitimization of a Flawed Social Construct|url=http://annals.org/aim/article/710064/medicalization-race-scientific-legitimization-flawed-social-construct|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=125|issue=8|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-125-8-199610150-00008|issn=0003-4819|pmid=8849153|pages=675–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."&lt;/ref&gt;

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference'', MIT press. Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 9" /&gt;

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the continued use of racial categories in health care and as risk factors could result in increased [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and discrimination in society and health services.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitmarsh 5"&gt;Ian Whitmarsh and David S.

Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Williams DR |title=The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 |journal=Health Services Research |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=261–74 |date=August 1994 |pmid=8063565 |pmc=1070005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goodman AH |title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=90 |issue=11 |pages=1699–702 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11076233 |pmc=1446406 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From concepts of race to ethnogenetic layering ===

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.&lt;ref name="Collins-2004"/&gt;

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the Cajun (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson F.L.C. | year = 2008 | title = Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 121–144 | doi = 10.1080/03014460801941752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = F.

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt; As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site/data/sup_data/2253/individual_genomes_instead_of_race_for_personalized_medicine.pdf |title=Individual Genomes Instead of Race for Personalized Medicine|vauthors=Ng PC, Zhao Q, Levy S, Strausberg RL, Venter JC|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|year=2008|volume=84|issue=3|pages=306–309|doi=10.1038/clpt.2008.114|pmid=18714319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.&lt;ref name=pmid15508000/&gt;

Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist [[Neil Risch]] argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Risch N. |author2=Burchard E. |author3=Ziv E. |author4=Tang H. | year = 2002 | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007| journal = Genome Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 7| pages = 1–12 | pmc=139378 | pmid=12184798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association studies==

One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | year = 2003 | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357| pages = 598–604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 | pmid = 12598158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | year = 2004 | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 5| pages = 512–517 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | pmid = 15052271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas DC, Witte JS | year = 2002 | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 505–512 | pmid = 12050090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wacholder S, Rothman N, Caporaso N|title=Counterpoint: bias from population stratification is not a major threat to the validity of conclusions from epidemiological studies of common polymorphisms and cancer|journal=Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev|year=2002|volume=11|issue=6|pages=513–20 |pmid=12050091|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/6/513.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various techniques detect and account for population substructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton NE, Collins A | year = 1998 | title = Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 19| pages = 11389–11393 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11389 | pmid = 9736746 | pmc = 21652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoggart CJ, Parra EJ, Shriver MD, Bonilla C, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | year = 2003 | title = Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations | url = | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 1492–1504 | doi = 10.1086/375613 | pmid = 12817591 | pmc = 1180309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Freedman ML|author2=Reich D|author3=Penney KL|author4=McDonald GJ|author5=Mignault AA|author6=Patterson N|author7=Gabriel SB|author8=Topol EJ|author9=Smoller JW | year = 2004 | title = Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies | url = | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 388–393 | pmid = 15052270 | doi = 10.1038/ng1333 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies.

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations.

==Sources of racial disparities in care==
In a report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process-level variables.&lt;ref name=Smed2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Smedley|first=Brian D.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=0-309-50911-4|pages=7–12|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient-level variables===
There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups.  First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different.  They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt;

===Health system-level factors===
Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes.  Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

===Care process-level variables===
Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities.&lt;ref name=Smed2002/&gt; Research in this area is new and ongoing.

'''Retained placenta''' is a condition in which all or part of the [[placenta]] or membranes remain in the [[uterus]] during the third stage of labour. &lt;ref name=Placenta&gt; [http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1194655799 Placenta (retention)]&lt;/ref&gt; Retained placenta can be broadly divided into:
* failed separation of the placenta from the uterine lining
* placenta separated from the uterine lining but retained within the uterus

A retained placenta is commonly a cause of postpartum [[haemorrhage]], both primary and secondary.&lt;ref name=Placenta&gt; [http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1194655799 Placenta (retention)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Retained placenta is generally defined as a placenta that has not undergone [[placental expulsion]] within 30 minutes of the baby’s birth where the third stage of labor has been managed actively.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;[http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/pd/2010/pdf/PD2010_064.pdf Maternity - Prevention, Early Recognition &amp; Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH)] From Department of Health, NSW. 21-Oct-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Risks of retained placenta include hemorrhage and infection. After the placenta is delivered, the uterus should contract down to close off all the blood vessels inside the uterus. If the placenta only partially separates, the uterus cannot contract properly, so the blood vessels inside will continue to bleed. A retained placenta thereby leads to hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a562148/retained-placenta#section3 Retained placenta], April 2015, BabyCenter, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Drugs, such as inraumbilical or intravenous oxytocin, are often used in the management of placental retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=James |title=What is the optimal pharmacological management of retained placenta?|journal=BMJ |doi=10.1136/bmj.g4778}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful ensuring the bladder is empty.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; However, [[ergometrine]] should not be given as it causes tonic uterine contractions which may delay placental expulsion.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; Controlled [[cord traction]] has been recommended as a second alternative after more than 30 minutes have passed after stimulation of uterine contractions, provided the uterus is contracted.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; Manual extraction may be required if cord traction also fails,&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; or if heavy ongoing bleeding occurs. Very rarely a curettage is necessary to ensure that no remnants of the placenta remain (in rare conditions with very adherent placenta such as a ''[[placenta accreta]]'').

However, in birth centers and attended home birth environments, it is common for licensed care providers to wait for the placenta's birth up to 2 hours in some instances.

==Other animals==
[[:wikt:retention|Retention]] of [[fetal membranes]] (afterbirth) is observed more frequently in cattle than in other animals. In a normal condition, a cow’s placenta is expelled within a 12-hour period after calving.&lt;ref name=retained&gt;[http://www.wvu.edu/~exten/infores/pubs/livepoul/dirm21.pdf Retained Placentas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], education and [[social work]] practice, '''social role valorization''' ('''SRV''') is the name given to an analysis of human relationships and human services, formulated in 1983 by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1991). "A Brief Introduction to Social Role Valorization as a High-Order Concept for Structuring Human Services. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Training Institute on Human Services Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social Role Valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. "Mental Retardation", 21(6): 234-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1985). Social role valorization: A new insight, a new term, for normalization. "Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded Journal", 9(1): 4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, S. &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (1999). An overview of social role valorization. In: R.J. Flynn &amp; R. A. LeMay, "A Quarter Century of Normalization and Social Role Valorization". Ottawa, Canada: University of Ottawa Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as the successor to his earlier formulation of the principle of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]] which is attributed to Nirje, Wolfensberger, and Bank-Mikkelsen worldwide (Lemay, 1995; Wolfensberger, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1972). "The Principle of Normalization in Human Services". Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. "Australian and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities", 17(2): 265-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1992). Bank-Mikkelsen: Founder of Normalization Principle. "News &amp; Notes", 5(2), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the idea that society tends to identify groups of people as fundamentally 'different', and of less value than everyone else. It catalogs the methods of this 'devaluation' and analyzes its effects. It may be used by those seeking to counteract these methods and effects. A recent compilation of normalization and social role valorization was by Flynn and LeMay (1999); their work remains important today in Europe, New Zealand and Australia among other countries.

==Overview of normalization and social role valorization==
Although normalization and the initial versions of SRV were described as an 'Ideology', the most recent formulation explicitly denies that SRV is about what ''should'' be done, and reinforces that SRV is intended to be a tool for analysis of the process and effects of Societal Devaluation.  Wolfensberger's most recent (1999) definition of SRV is: "the application of what science can tell us about the enablement, establishment, enhancement, maintenance, and/or defence of valued social roles for people" (Susan Thomas and Wolf Wolfensberger in Flynn and Lemay 1999,  p.&amp;nbsp;125). Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012. University students and training institute colleagues can be found worldwide with many internationally seeking collaborative projects with the Wolfensberger (e.g., now Rannveig Traustadottir, now Gender and Disability Chair at the University of Iceland).

Social role valorization (SRV) is a  relationship theory of empirical knowledge for the design and rendering of formal and informal services and relationships to people with any need or condition, especially those who are devalued or are at risk.  Social role valorization is intended to address the social and psychological wounds that are inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on those who are close to them.

SRV does not in itself propose a 'goal'.  However a person who has a goal of improving the lives of devalued people may choose to use insights gained from SRV to cause change.  They may do so by attempting to create or support socially valued roles for people in their society, because if a person holds valued social roles, a person is highly likely to receive from society those good things in life that are available or at least the opportunities for obtaining them. In other words, all sorts of good things that other people are able to convey are almost automatically apt to be accorded to a person who holds societally valued roles, at least within the resources and norms of his/her society.

Social role valorization identifies social devaluation as a critical human experience that has long-term effects on the individual.  SRV is designed to raise consciousness about the fate of socially devalued persons.  SRV holds that the human being is vulnerable to the regard of others for both the heights of edification and the depths of degradation.

An understanding of social role valorization can lead to ideas about how to improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes – firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action that leads to people being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons. This alliance will unify people, broaden acceptance of differences, and encourage coexistence.

SRV is a realistic if not pessimistic sense of human behaviour, holding that human beings are imperfect and capable of great evils even if they are occasionally saintly, heroic or kind.

Social role valorization is designed to address the social and psychological wounds that get inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives, and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on them and those who are close and committed to them.

==Basic structure==
SRV is a description of how societally differentiated people are devalued, assigned low-value roles, and treated poorly, often to the extent of risk to their own lives. This poor treatment is given to members of any group that is given low value by powerful forces in society.

SRV considers only those things that can be known from a scientific perspective. In itself it does not subscribe to a particular ideology – it does not say what should be done and it does not say what is morally correct.

However, SRV does understand that human interaction is impossible without a moral code and so SRV can be used to suggest what is desirable given the spoken or unspoken moral code of a particular society or individual. Consequently, it is necessary to understand what sort of moral code and societal expectations might be around the implementation of any application of SRV. A consideration of the concepts of humanity and morality place SRV in an appropriate context.

Any particular human society will have a set of written and unwritten rules about who is a member of that society and about how members of that society should act, and what treatment is due to non-members of that society. These rules are often set down in codes of law and in religious texts. Every society has such a moral code.

Support for SRV can be found throughout the human sciences. Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines.

===Science in psychology, special education and philosophy===

Psychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms.

Science tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and  roles that organize and simplify their social communication. Particular people may be forced into a negative role which they do not desire.

Science tells us that individuals and groups will place positive and negative values onto other individuals and groups. This assignation of value may lead to a process of devaluation.

Complex societal forces mediate the exercise of power and social control in a society. These forces are often not well understood by individuals in that society.

Individuals in a society are very aware of similarities and differences between members of that society. This is societal differentiation.

Such difference groups may include people with the following differences from the valued norm:
*People with mental difficulties (including those states labelled as mental illness and learning disability)
*People with physical capability differences (including those labelled as having difficulties with mobility, body control and bodily integrity)
*People with physical appearance differences (including those labelled as facially disfigured, unusual appearance, overweight or underweight)
*People perceived to be of a different ethnic or racial group
*People of different gender or sexuality
*People who are labelled criminals (whether legally or morally so or not)
*People who do not accept societal norms for whatever reason
*People who use drugs (including those who use alcohol and nicotine as well as those who use chemicals more usually called drugs in the society)
*People who exhibit lack of control according to the expectations of that society

Psychology shows us that perception and interpretation are complex subjects, highly reliant on beliefs and prejudices. Human perception and interpretation is complicated and often not in accord with what 'common sense' tells us that it is.

Learning and particularly imitation are the natural modes of behavior formation and are important in developing useful as well as damaging performances.

Image and image transfer are important subjects when considering how people interpret each other and their own surroundings.

Performance, reputation and grouping determine how people are seen and interpreted.

===Summary of relationship to theories of power, deviancy and role relations===

So, we may summarise: people who differ in any way from societal expectations or desirability, where this difference is negatively valued, will be badly treated by that society.

Powerful groups in society will:

*Define people as different
*Treat people with the same or similar differences as a group.
*If the difference is seen as negative, it will treat such groups badly.
*It will assign negative deviancy roles to such groups and people. (These deviancy roles include: not human (animal-like, plant-like, less than human, not yet human, used to be human, alien), waste, trivium (clown-like, humorously insignificant), threat, burden of charity, and death related roles.)

SRV suggests that role messages are largely conveyed by image, whether of the individual or of their surroundings (including accompanying people). A person's potential roles may be limited or assigned by the company they keep, the surroundings in which they live, or the activities they engage in.

SRV suggests that Role Occupancy is dependent on apparent competency in that role. So the availability of roles may be limited or assigned by the person's ability (or, more importantly, the lack of ability) to perform the necessary role requirements for the effective performance of that role.

====Effects related to role theories: good things and devaluation====
People cast into such negative roles will be denied the good things in life:

The good things in life:
*Family or small intimate group
*An intermediate but still small-scale group
*A transcendental belief system
*Absence of imminent threats of extreme privation
*To be viewed as a human and treated with respect
*To be treated justly
*Friends
*Work, especially meaningful work
*Opportunities and expectations to discover and develop skills, abilities, gifts and talents
*To be dealt with honestly
*To be treated as an individual
*Access to the 'sites of everyday life'
*Being able to contribute, and having ones contributions recognised as valuable

Further, such groups will be damaged in the following ways:

'Wounds' or bad things which happen to devalued persons:

*''Relegation'' to low ('deviant') status and rejection, perhaps by family, neighbours, community, society, service workers, leading to:
**Cast into one or more historical deviancy roles
**Symbolical stigmatising, 'marking', 'deviancy-imaging', 'branding'
**Being multiply jeopardised, scapegoated
**Distantiation: usually via segregation and also congregation
**Loss of control, perhaps even autonomy and freedom, leading to:
***Discontinuity with the physical environment and objects
***Social and relationship discontinuity, even abandonment
***Absence or loss of natural/freely given relationships, and substitution of artificial/'bought' ones
***Deindividualization, leading to:
****Involuntary material poverty, material/financial exploitation
****Impoverishment of experience, especially that of the typical, valued world
****Exclusion from knowledge of, and participation in, higher order value systems (e.g. religion) that give meaning and direction to life, and provide community
****Having one's life 'wasted'
****Being the object of brutalisation, 'killing thoughts', and death making

=====Other reactions to bad treatment=====

Additional mental and behavioral response patterns that are evidence of disturbed interactions with the world, and that are engendered by certain wounds and wound clusters, are:

*Feeling like being an alien in the world
*A sense of worthlessness, dislike of self, despair
*Insecurity
*Failure sets and avoidance mentalities
*Awareness of being a source of anguish to those who love one
*Searching for the abandoner
*Fantasy and inventions about relationships that do not exist, and may never have existed
*Seeking/demanding physical contact, perhaps insatiably
*Problematic testing of genuineness of personal and social relationships, particularly new ones
*Turning the hurt into resentment or hatred towards privileged people, benefactors, society, or God
*Withdrawing from human contact, perhaps even from reality
*Rage, perhaps violence
*A sapping of energy, both physical and mental, resulting in a lowering of intelligent behavior, and possibly even of intelligence

The coping mechanism is to avoid negative roles and outcomes:
*SRV suggests that in trying to avoid the above, it is most useful to seek positive valued roles for the devalued people and groups.
*SRV suggests that such role re-valorization may be considerably more effective than other means of assisting people in devalued states.
*Consequently, SRV suggests that enhancing competency and image (of the person and their surroundings) will result in positive roles being made a possibility for devalued people.
*If such positive roles are supported and defended, and further positive roles are sought and achieved, then the devalued person will be more likely to achieve more of the good things in life, and avoid the Wounds and other Negative Effects secondary to Devaluation.

=====Positive actions at different levels=====
In order to ensure that positive roles are available to persons who have been devalued by society, it is necessary to consider actions at multiple levels:

*The level of the person themselves (personal appearance and competency)
*The level of the usual immediate environment of the person (where they live, work, learn and play)
*The level of all the life arenas in which a person may engage (everywhere else they engage with society)
*The level of society itself (how one may effect political, legal and moral change regarding the devaluation of individuals)

SRV suggests that by these means, people who have been devalued by society may be rescued (or may rescue themselves) from the effects of devaluation, and may manage to live their lives occupying Valued Roles and become seen as valued by society. Other theories regarding "mentally handicapped" individuals include consciousness raising and implications for normalization from the women's movement, related self-advocacy movements in special education and rehabilitation, and now the new movement to community inclusion as represented at the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006).

==Criticisms==
{{POV section|date=August 2012}}
# SRV has had a lifespan of barely a generation even if taking into account its predecessor normalization (resulting in Nordic countries in the first integrated generation worldwide). According to one editor, this timeframe compared to the history of asylums, should give anyone pause in granting to it a permanency in societies which is still being established and solidified. History would predict a period of transinstitutionalization and retrenchment, and again further efforts to develop and promote and strengthen community. 
# SRV does not consistently raise consciousness and guarantee concern about socially devalued persons in part because it has a moral base in societies which are struggling with ethical concerns in government and administration. Ideologies cannot ultimately control the character of their adherents even though they are influential. Further, their theoretical value can be nullified if used wrongly. More often, theories such as SRV are analyzed and presented inaccurately by their opponents, and a real debate seldom is forthcoming.
# Not all alliances between socially valued and devalued persons are moral, fruitful and advantageous which follows the literature on attempts at co-optation of all civil rights movements.
# Knowing how social devaluation works in society may still leave one impotent against it. However, efforts at social valuations, in the context of positivism, can counteract for individuals and families the literature's "downward spiral".
# SRV's societal impact, thus far, is largely confined to several narrow human service fields.  In part, this factor is due to the insular nature of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the categorical division of state agencies and delivery system.
# SRV is open to criticism because of the later politico-moral stance (Christian, right wing conservatism) of its founder, Wolf Wolfensberger, in which he advances a non-mainstream response to the plight of the wounded (his conceptual term) in society.  This response may be seen as anti-death (opposing all abortion and all forms of euthanasia), morally conservative, anti-bourgeoise feminist (stressing the 'importance' of motherhood rather than parenthood, and persistently relegating women to subsidiary power roles), homophobic, anti psychiatry and religiose. 
This criticism appears unjust in that Wolfensberger is an early proponent of the rights of people with mental retardation to marry, while other professionals placed the same individuals in institutional abuse and confinement. His doctoral students hold leadership positions in gender and disability, and he is associated with liberals in his own academic department who support actions in that context to address entrenched societal discrimination.
# Although Wolf Wolfensberger attempts to isolate SRV from his underlying beliefs, SRV may be negatively affected by this association for those whom disagree with these moral and religious positions (which of course, include a decade of students and colleagues as well). Reference to the series of Pamphlets entitled 'TIPS' and edited by Wolf Wolfensberger provides graphic evidence of the politico-moral stance of the lead proponents of SRV. This criticism has resulted in liberals and moderates involved in broader discrimination movements (e.g., gay civil unions, Black &amp; Grey Panthers, Red and Pink Hat Societies) to limit the involvement of SRV adherents in their work.
# SRV, with roots in normalization and related citizen advocacy, supports unpaid relationships, giving, volunteerism, life commitments, and commitments to new approaches to shared living, including the co-residency model and the L'Arche communities. 
It can be suggested that all constructed attempts to re-valorize the roles and raise the social status of marginalised individuals and groups are hollow as they are artificial, but of course, government is responsible to provide minimum wage laws, to increase worker benefits, to maintain entitlements, to provide quality housing and beneficial and affordable health care. 
In other words, the person providing the re-valorization efforts such as a social worker or supported employment worker is paid to do his or her job, and is not helping the marginalised person out of genuine interpersonal motivation such as friendship, attraction or emotional attachment, and people are well aware of this monetary role in professions in human services. Therefore, any re-valorized role is viewed by those outside the relationship as non-genuine, unstable, though new evidence and theory (e.g., theories of social acceptance, versus deviance) suggests that beneficence and social acceptance are active and result in positive life outcomes. Thus, paid roles (sometimes preferred in modern life) would tend to negate the security-giving benefits that valued, familial and friendship roles would normally provide.

==Misconceptions==
Some criticism of social role valorization is said by its advocates to be because of misconceptions about it. Such misconceptions include:
* that the theory sees that some people have more value, and others less (the theory speaks about how people are valued by society, in the assumption that all actually have equal value),
* that social role valorization encourages action which supports the valuing of certain sections of society or behaviours (the theory actually encourages action that helps society to value groups previously 'devalued'),
* that social role valorization works against self-advocacy efforts by a group of devalued people (the theory describes how labelling and segregating people supports social devaluation, but says nothing to deny that good can come from groups identifying themselves as having common cause or as having experiences or cultures in common).

The theory of social role valorization is best understood as referring primarily to extreme devaluation (such that few people care much about what happens to an individual or group, or even actively look for their eradication) not more subtle (but still damaging) devaluation such as occurs between different social classes or between genders.

==Comparative community theories==
Social role valorization (SRV), similar to normalization, is a foundational theory with roots in intellectual and developmental disabilities, often termed learning disabilities in Europe. It is a revolutionary concept which took roots in the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements of the 1970s and 1980s which aligned themselves with its broad concepts and goals more so than with the specifics of the theory, goals and formulations itself. SRV and normalization adherents, in contrast, are committed first to the specific theories and have tended to be reluctant to engage in academic theoretical discussions with related theorists (e.g., independent and supportive living; support and empowerment paradigms; user-and-family directed services; self-determination and choice theories). In addition, other giants in community development such as Gunnar Dybwad, advisors to Presidents in the US, Brandeis University professor, friend of the Center on Human Policy, and former Arc-US director, often are missed in contrasting theory formulations.

SRV is supportive of the development of community paradigms (e.g., Schwartz, McKnight, O'Brien, Taylor, Racino, Wehman, Roberts, Towell, Lakin, Bruininks, Braddock, Hemp, Rogan, Anthony, Carling, Seekins, Condeluci &amp; Gretz-Lasky)&lt;ref&gt;Condeluci, A. &amp; Gretz-Lasky. (1987). Social role valorization: A model of community reentry. "Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation", 2(1): 49-56.&lt;/ref&gt; which were necessary to replace the institutional paradigms of the pre-expose era, however, with community paradigms taking over 20 years to become the mainstream academic publications. Today, new goals of integration, a basic principle of normalization, involve the integration of family studies to include families with a disability family member, integration of financing (e.g., housing and homes), long-term services and supports development (e.g., personal assistance, support aides for homes and families), and modernization to areas such as green and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". New York, NY: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina''' is a potentially invasive type of [[cancer]] that forms in the tissues of the [[vagina]].  Though uncommon, [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous-cell cancer]] of the vagina (SCCV) is the most common type of [[vaginal cancer]]. It is further subdivided inot the following subtypes: keratinizing, nonkeratinizing, basaloid, and warty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dynamed.com/topics/dmp~AN~T114827/Squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-vagina|title=Squamous-cell Carcinoma of the Vagina|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dynamed.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms in [[squamous cells]], the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Squamous cell vaginal cancer spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/patient/vaginal-treatment-pdq|title=Vaginal Cancer Treatment|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCCV accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases and initially spreads superficially within the vaginal wall. It can later invade other vaginal tissues. The carcinoma can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] to the lungs, and less frequently in liver, bone, or other sites. SCC of the vagina is associated with a high rate of infection with oncogenic strains of [[Human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV) and has many risk factors in common with [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/hp/vaginal-treatment-pdq|title=Vaginal Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version, Incidence and Mortality|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
SCCV may not cause early signs or symptoms and may be found during a routine [[Pelvic examination|pelvic exam]] and [[Pap test]]. Signs and symptoms may be caused by other types of vaginal cancer or by other conditions:
* [[Vaginal bleeding|bleeding]] or [[Vaginal discharge|discharge]] not related to menstrual period
* [[Dyspareunia|pain during sexual intercourse]]
* [[Pelvic pain|pain in the pelvic area]]
* lump in the vagina
* [[Dysuria|pain when urinating]]
* [[constipation]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Risks==
* [[multiple sex partners]]
* age &gt; 60 years
* [[smoking]]
* human papillomavirus ([[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV) infection]]
* early age at first intercourse&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis includes a complete assessment of [[medical history]] and physical examination. A pelvic exam is typically performed. Other diagnostic procedures used are the pap test, [[colposcopy]] and [[biopsy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other procedures are used to aid in diagnosis: [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]], [[CT scan]] (CAT scan), [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), [[Positron emission tomography|PET scan]] (positron emission tomography scan), and [[cystoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/vaginal/patient/vaginal-treatment-pdq#section/_26|title=Stages of Vaginal Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Those most affected are:
*older women
**peak incidence 60-79 years
**&lt; 15% in women &lt; 50 years old
**&lt; 10% in women &lt; 40 years old
*Fifty percent of SCCV associated with [[hysterectomy]]
*Incidence may increase with [[pelvic organ prolapse]]
* More prevalent in black and Hispanic women
*accounts for 80%-90% of all vaginal cancers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends upon the following:
* stage and size of the cancer
* Whether the cancer is close to other organs that may be damaged by treatment
* Whether the patient has a [[uterus]] or has had a hysterectomy
* Whether the patient has had past [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatment]] to the pelvis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''systemic disease''' is one that affects a number of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], or affects the [[Human body|body]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,28th edition (Harcourt Brace &amp; Company). Page 489,1653&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Mastocytosis]], including [[mast cell activation syndrome]] and [[eosinophilic esophagitis]]
*[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]]
*[[vasculitis|Systemic vasculitis]] e.g. [[Lupus erythematosus|SLE]], [[Polyarteritis nodosa|PAN]]
*[[Sarcoidosis]] – a disease that mainly affects the lungs, brain, joints and eyes, found most often in young African-American women.
*[[Hypothyroidism]] – where the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormones.
*[[Diabetes mellitus]] – an imbalance in blood glucose (sugar) levels.
*[[Fibromyalgia]]
*[[Adrenal insufficiency]] – where the adrenal glands don't produce enough steroid hormones 
*[[Coeliac disease]] – an autoimmune disease triggered by [[gluten]] consumption, which may involve several organs and cause a variety of symptoms, or be completely asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=LebwoholLudvigsson&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors =Lebwohl B, Ludvigsson JF, Green PH|title=Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity|journal=BMJ|volume=351|pages=4347|date=Oct 2015|pmid=26438584|pmc=4596973|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4347|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ulcerative colitis]] – an inflammatory bowel disease
*[[Crohn's disease]] – an inflammatory bowel disease
*[[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)
*[[Metabolic syndrome]]
*[[Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|AIDS]] – a disease caused by a virus that cripples the body’s immune defenses.
*[[Grave's disease]] – a thyroid disorder, most often in women, which can cause a goiter (swelling in the front part of the neck) and protruding eyes.
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] – a connective tissue disorder involving mainly the skin, joints and kidneys.
*[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] – an inflammatory disease which mainly attacks the joints. But can also affect a person's skin, eyes, lungs and mouth. 
*[[Atherosclerosis]] – a hardening of the arteries
*[[Sickle cell disease]] – an inherited blood disorder that can block circulation throughout the body, primarily affecting people of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] origin.
*[[Myasthenia gravis]]

==Detection==
Getting a regular [[eye exam]] may play a role in identifying the signs of some systemic diseases. "The eye is composed of many different types of tissue. This unique feature makes the eye susceptible to a wide variety of diseases as well as provides insights into many body systems. Almost any part of the eye can give important clues to the diagnosis of systemic diseases. Signs of a systemic disease may be evident on the outer surface of the eye (eyelids, conjunctiva and cornea), middle of the eye and at the back of the eye (retina)."&lt;ref&gt;"The Eye in Systemic Disease" (University of Illinois at Chicago: 2008), Available at: http://www.uic.edu/com/eye/LearningAboutVision/EyeFacts/SystemicDisease.shtml, Accessed 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[500 B.C.]], some researchers have believed that the physical condition of the [[fingernail]]s and [[toenail]]s can indicate various systemic diseases. Careful examination of the fingernails and toenails may provide clues to underlying systemic diseases {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, since some diseases have been found to cause disruptions in the nail growth process. The [[nail plate]] is the hard [[keratin]] cover of the nail. The nail plate is generated by the [[nail matrix]] located just under the cuticle. As the nail grows, the area closest to becoming exposed to the outside world (distal) produces the deeper layers of the nail plate, while the part of the nail matrix deeper inside the finger (proximal) makes the superficial layers. Any disruption in this growth process can lead to an alteration in the shape and texture.

For example, pitting looks like depressions in the hard part of the nail. Pitting is to be associated with [[Psoriasis|psoriasis]], affecting 10% - 50% of patients with that disorder. &lt;ref&gt;Mayeaux EJ Jr. Nail disorders. Prim Care 2000;27: 333-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitting also may be caused by a variety of systemic diseases, including [[reactive arthritis]] and other [[connective tissue disorders]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[pemphigus]], [[alopecia areata]], and [[incontinentia pigmenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel CR 3d, Sams WM Jr, Scher RK. Nails in systemic disease. Dermatol Clin 1985;3:465-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Because pitting is caused by defective layering of the superficial nail plate by the proximal nail matrix, any localized dermatitis (e.g., [[atopic|atopic dermatitis]] or chemical [[dermatitis]]) that disrupts orderly growth in that area also can cause pitting.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. ROBERT S. FAWCETT, M.D., M.S., SEAN LINFORD, M.D., and DANIEL L. STULBERG, M.D., ''Nail Abnormalities: Clues to Systemic Disease'' (American Family Physician, March 15, 2004), Available at http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040315/1417.html, Accessed 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M.

|Middle Ages and Renaissance||The incidence of tuberculosis grows progressively in these times, displacing [[leprosy]], peaking between the 18th and 19th century as field workers move to the cities looking for work.&lt;ref&gt;Aufderheide 1998:129&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of Europe, tuberculosis is known as the “king’s evil” and is widely believed that the kings of England and France can cure ''[[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]]'' simply by touching those affected.&lt;ref name="news-medical.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/History-of-Tuberculosis.aspx|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].
|-
|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed. Several international conferences are held, focusing on the fundamental, biological, clinical and social aspects of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="theunion"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Tuberculosis|url=http://www.theunion.org/who-we-are/history|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1980s onward||Tuberculosis [[antibiotic resistance|drug-resistant]] strains appear, provoking a rise in incidence in countries like [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Also, the association with [[AIDS]] has contributed to the rise of tuberculosis in some sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuberculosis (TB) and other mycobacterial diseases: diagnosis, screening, management and data|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-other-mycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Present||Today, tuberculosis continues to be a top infectious disease killer worldwide. However, the death rate has dropped 47% since 1990. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries, with the most severe burden in Africa.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; At least 1 million children fall ill with tuberculosis each year, represent about 11% of all cases.&lt;ref name="ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENDING TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN|url=http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/childhood_tb_informationsheet.pdf?ua=1|publisher=WHO|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J. Hoffman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/to-save-humanity-9780190221546?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=To Save Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been practiced in Africa ([[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]]&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;), Asia ([[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]]&lt;ref name=jwh&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hull |first1=T |last2=Hilber |first2=AM |last3=Chersich |first3=MF |last4=Bagnol |first4=B |last5=Prohmmo |first5=A |last6=Smit |first6=JA |last7=Widyantoro |first7=N |last8=Utomo |first8=ID |last9=François |first9=I |last10=Tumwesigye |first10=NM |last11=Temmerman |first11=M |last12=WHO GSVP Study |first12=Group. |title=Prevalence, motivations, and adverse effects of vaginal practices in Africa and Asia: findings from a multicountry household survey. |journal=Journal of women's health (2002) |date=July 2011 |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=1097-109 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.2281 |pmid=21668355|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Central America]] (among the [[Q'eqchi' people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjqgBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56|title=Q’eqchi’ Maya Reproductive Ethnomedicine|publisher=Spring|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

It has become a fad for women in the Western world. It is described in spas as an [[Traditional Korean medicine|ancient Korean treatment]] for reproductive organ ailments and is claimed to have other benefits. There is no empirical evidence supporting any of these claims.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
According to a study on [[vagina]]l practices by the [[World Health Organization]] published in 2011, one of the ways in which women practice vaginal care is by "Vaginal steaming or smoking: the 'steaming' or 'smoking' of the vagina, by sitting above a source of heat (fire, coals, hot rocks) on which water, herbs, or oils are placed to create steam or smoke".&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt; For that study, over 4,000 women in  Tete (Mozambique), KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), Yogyakarta (Indonesia), and Chonburi (Thailand) were asked about their vaginal care. When it came to vaginal steaming/smoking, very different results were obtained, and very different reasons were given: in Chonburi, 67% of women reported having performed vaginal steaming or smoking, "which they associated with  maintaining  wellness  and  feminine  identity", especially after [[Postpartum period|having given birth]] (85.5%). In Tete, only 10% of women practiced steaming or smoking, "mostly intended to enhance male sexual pleasure by causing vaginal tightening (64.1% of users) and drying (22.9%)". In the two African locations, 37–38% of women said they practiced it to enhance "male sexual pleasure"; in the two Asian ones, 0% gave that answer. Conversely, of the Asian women 26% reported their "feminine identity" was a reason, compared to 0% of the African women.&lt;ref name=jwh/&gt;

==Risks==
[[Side effect]] and potential dangers include: [[allergic reactions]], [[second-degree burns]] if the steam is too close,&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; and [[vaginal infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Marketing===
Vaginal steaming is marketed with pseudoscientific notions of "balancing" female hormones and "revitalizing" the [[uterus]] or vagina.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea|title=Sorry, Gwyneth Paltrow, but steaming your vagina is a bad idea|work=The Guardian|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=9 March 2017|last=Robinson|first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gunter |first1=Jen |title=Gwyneth Paltrow says steam your vagina, an OB/GYN says don’t |url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/gwyneth-paltrow-says-steam-your-vagina-an-obgyn-says-dont/ |work=Dr. Jen Gunter Wielding the Lasso of Truth |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also claimed to: reduce the discomfort, bloating and tiredness associated with [[menstruation]], regulate irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s, treat [[Vaginal yeast infection|yeast infections]], decrease the menstrual blood flow, increase fertility, relieve symptoms of [[menopause]], treat [[endometriosis]], speed up the after-birth healing process.  There is no evidence for any of those claims.&lt;ref name=LiveScience/&gt; 

It is also marketed as "cleaning" the vagina, which it does not do, and which is not necessary.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;

The marketing and perception of vaginal steaming falls within a mix of ideologies including [[post-feminist]], [[new age]], and inherently [[sexist]] notions in which the female body is on the one hand a dirty, defective thing, yet one that a woman can "optimize" to become "goddess-like".&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite article|title='Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina': unpacking Western representations of vaginal steaming |first1=Tycho |last1=Vandenburg |first2=Virginia |last2=Braun |work=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality |volume=19 |number=4 |year=2017|pmid=27719108}} (taking as its title one observer's characterization{{snd}}"Basically, it's sorcery for your vagina") {{cite article|title=I Went To A Spa For My Uterus And This Is My Story |work=Fast Company |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041307/body-week/i-went-to-a-spa-for-my-uterus-and-this-is-my-story |last=Beck|first=Laura Hopper |date=January 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a [[list of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]] that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, and is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 22 July 1946. It incorporated the {{lang|fr|[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]|italic=no}} and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its establishment, it has played a leading role in the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable disease]]s, in particular [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; the mitigation of the effects of [[non-communicable disease]]s such as sexual and [[reproductive health]], development, and aging; nutrition, [[food security]] and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking.

The WHO is responsible for the [[World Health Report]], the worldwide [[World Health Survey]], and [[World Health Day]]. The current Director-General of the WHO is [[Tedros Adhanom]], who started his five-year term on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |title=Dr Tedros takes office as WHO Director-General |date=1 July 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The [[International Sanitary Conferences]], originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases, chief among them [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and the [[bubonic plague]]. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892; when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed. Five years later, a convention for the plague was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |title=The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences, 1851–1938 |last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]], and the {{lang|fr|Office International d'Hygiène Publique|italic=no}} were soon founded in 1902 and 1907, respectively. When the [[League of Nations]] was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations.

During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, [[Szeming Sze]], a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, [[Alger Hiss]], the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health.&lt;ref name="Pitt ULS"&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 Sze Szeming Papers, 1945–2014, UA.90.F14.1], University Archives, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302|pmc=1614381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Move towards a New Health Organization: International Health Conference |journal=Chronicle of the World Health Organization |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–11 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |format=PDF |year=1947 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031008/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.&lt;ref name="shimkin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281|pmid=17810349 |pmc=1614381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1016.3166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947/&gt; The first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of {{US$|5 million}} (then {{GBP|1250000}}) for the 1949 year.

===Operational history===
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]
In 1947 the WHO established an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information service via [[telex]], and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] inoculation drive using the [[BCG vaccine]] was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref name="at60"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.&lt;ref name= Fenner2&gt;{{cite book |last=Fenner |first=Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication |series=History of International Public Health |volume=6 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1966, the WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the [[Palace of Nations]] to a newly constructed HQ elsewhere in Geneva.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|title=Construction of the main WHO building|year=2016|website=who.int|publisher=WHO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611011659/http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|archive-date=2018-06-11|dead-url=no|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4&amp;nbsp;million annually to the effort and adopted a new [[disease surveillance]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |first=Vladimír |last=Zikmund  |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |journal=Central European Journal of Public Health |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=55–56 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20586232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |last1=Holland |first=Walter W. |title=Karel Raška – The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orenstein |first1=Walter A. |last2=Plotkin |first2=Stanley A. |title=Vaccines |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=smallpox&amp;rid=vacc.section.45#47| publisher=W.B.

In 1974, the [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] and the control programme of [[onchocerciasis]] was started, an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the [[World Bank]].

In 1977, the first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of "[[Health For All]]" was declared.

In 1986, the WHO began its global programme on [[HIV/AIDS]]. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 [[UNAIDS]] was formed.

In 1988, the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established.&lt;ref name="at60" /&gt;

In 1998, WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced [[infant mortality]], increased life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Stop TB Partnership]] was created along with the UN's formulation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In 2001 the [[measles]] initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] was drawn up to improve the resources available.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt; In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Mu Xuequan |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |website=chinaview.cn |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall focus===
The WHO's Constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution: (a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work; (b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate; (c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services; (d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments; (e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services; (g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries; (i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{As of |2012}}, the WHO has defined its role in public health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* providing technical support, catalyzing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.
* [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] to provide monitoring of vital events (birth, death, wedding, divorce).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/en/|title=Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)|website=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===
The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 5 areas among which funding was distributed.&lt;ref name="20123budget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those five areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

As of 2015, the WHO has worked within the [[UNAIDS]] network and strived to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether [[RTS,S]]/AS01, were a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]s and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]], and since 2005, over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7&amp;nbsp;million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |website=WHO work mediacenter|publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate [[polio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since which partnered WHO with [[Rotary International]], the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), and smaller organizations. {{As of| 2011}}, it has been working to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study was conducted where why Polio Vaccines may not be enough to eradicate the Virus &amp; conduct new technology. Polio is now on the verge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Non-communicable diseases===
Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature deaths from chronic [[noncommunicable disease]]s, [[mental disorder]]s, violence and [[injury prevention|injuries]], and [[visual impairment]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Life-course Sexual and Reproductive Health has published the magazine, ''Entre Nous'', across Europe since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Entre Nous'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715203751/http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | archive-date = 15 July 2017 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | website = euro.who.int | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | oclc = 782375711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental health===
The WHO estimates that 12.6&amp;nbsp;million people died as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in 2012 –  this accounts for nearly 1 in 4 of total global deaths. Environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures, climate change, and ultraviolet radiation, contribute to more than 100 diseases and injuries. This can result in a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An estimated 12.6&amp;nbsp;million deaths each year are attributable to unhealthy environments |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/deaths-attributable-to-unhealthy-environments/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life course and life style===
WHO works to "reduce [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the [[Infant|neonatal period]], [[childhood]] and adolescence, and improve [[Sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]] and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218011849/http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |archive-date=18 February 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for "health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, [[drugs]] and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and [[unsafe sex]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO works to improve nutrition, [[food safety]] and [[food security]] and to ensure this has a positive effect on [[public health]] and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

===Surgery and trauma care===

The WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/ Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/surgery/globalinitiative/en/ |title=Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care |publisher=WHO |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trauma care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/emergencycare/trauma/essential-care/en/ |title=Essential trauma care project |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency work===
The World Health Organization's primary objective in natural and man-made emergencies is to coordinate with member states and other stakeholders to "reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability."&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="AP-20140505"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff Writer--&gt; |title=UN: Spread of polio now an world health emergency |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140505/eu-med-polio-emergency-6e6900dc37.html |date=5 May 2014 |location=London |agency=[[AP News]] |publisher=Mindspark Interactkookve Network, Inc. |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140505"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladstone |first=Rick |title=Polio Spreading at Alarming Rates, World Health Organization Declares |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/world-health-organization-polio-health-emergency.html |date=5 May 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of [[Ebola]] was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=Kate |last1=Kelland |first2=Felix |last2=Onuah |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/us-health-ebola-africa-idUSKBN0G81Q820140808 |title=WHO declares Ebola an international health emergency |location=London/Lagos |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health policy===
WHO addresses government [[health policy]] with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform [[health policy]] options. It oversees the implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]], and publishes a series of [[medical classification]]s; of these, three are over-reaching "reference classifications": the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) and the [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] (adopted in 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (adopted in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]] (adopted in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt; WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their use of and their reporting about their use of research evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, S.J., Lavis, J.N. &amp; Bennett, S., 2009. The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems. Healthcare Policy, 5(1), pp.66–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;
* "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda"; and
* "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".

====Partnerships====
The WHO along with the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development co-operation into practice in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=International Health Partnership |publisher=IHP+ |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work, such as the [[WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/en/ |title=WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231145418/http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874|archivedate=31 December 2016|title=WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy: Seventh Report |website=WHO Press Office |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Interprofessional education#WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice|WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/professionals/coordination/en/index.html |title=WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice |publisher=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, targeted at improving [[health policy]] and [[health system|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/en/index.html |title=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the [[HINARI]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ |title=HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme |publisher=Who.int |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO collaborates with the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. 

WHO created the Civil Society Reference Group on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which brings together other networks that are involved in policy making and the dissemination of guidelines.

WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world.

WHO facilitates technical partnerships through the Technical Advisory Committee on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Technical Advisory Committee on HIV|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which they created to develop WHO guidelines and policies.

====Public health education and action====
Each year, the organization marks [[World Health Day]] and other observances focusing on a specific [[health promotion]] topic. World Health Day falls on 7 April each year, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding. Recent themes have been [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]] (2014), healthy ageing (2012) and [[drug resistance]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/world-health-day/en/ |title=World Health Day – 7 April |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]], and [[World AIDS Day]].

As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/about/en/index.html |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf |title=Accelerating progress towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals |year=2010 |format=PDF |page=2 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data handling and publications===
The World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well-being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/ |title=WHO World Health Survey |publisher=WHO |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health|Study on Global Aging and Adult Health]]'' (SAGE) covering over 50,000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sage/en/index.html |title=WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) |publisher=WHO |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Country Health Intelligence Portal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Health Policy Process|url=http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|accessdate=4 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121222652/http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|archivedate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it.

The WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national [[health system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: a handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/index.htm |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Health Human Resources|health workforces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health |publisher=WHO |year=2009 |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Observatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Health Observatory|url=http://www.who.int/gho/en/index.html|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS), the ''WHO Quality of Life Instrument'' (WHOQOL), and the ''Service Availability and Readiness Assessment'' (SARA) provide guidance for data collection.&lt;ref&gt;See respectively:*{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/index.html |title=Mental Health: WHO-AIMS |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf  |title=WHOQOL-BREF: Introduction, Administration, Scoring and Generic Version of the Assessment |format=PDF |year=1996 |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sara_introduction/en/ |title=Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the [[Health Metrics Network]], also aim to provide sufficient high-quality information to assist governmental decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatishmn/en/index.html |title=What is HMN? |website=Health Metrics Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs, including through the [[Evidence-Informed Policy Network]] (EVIPNet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/rpc/evipnet/en/ |title=Evidence-Informed Policy Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1414&amp;Itemid=931 |title=Policy on Research for Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as [[MiNDbank]], went online. The database was launched on [[Human Rights Day]], and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights, and the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being implemented in different countries.&lt;ref name=MiNDbank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/mindbank-20131210/en/ |title=Mental health information at your fingertips – WHO launches the MiNDbank |publisher=Who.int |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains important international documents and information. The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review policies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health.&lt;ref name="MiNDbank"/&gt;

The WHO regularly publishes a ''[[World Health Report]]'', its leading publication, including an expert assessment of a specific [[global health]] topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/whr/en/index.html |title=The World Health Report |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications of WHO include the ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/en/ |title=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]'' (overseen by EMRO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emro.who.int/emhj.htm |title=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'' (published in collaboration with [[BioMed Central]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human-resources-health.com/ |title=Human Resources for Health |publisher=BioMed Central |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pan American Journal of Public Health]]'' (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/journal/ |title=Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|title=Global health sector strategy on HIV, 2016–2021|website=World Health Organization|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with interim targets for the year 2020. In order to make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic. 

==Structure==
The World Health Organization is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=9 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
[[File:World Health Organization membership status map.png|thumb|right|Countries by World Health Organization membership status]]
{{As of|2016}}, the WHO has 194 member states: all of them Member States of the United Nations except for the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]].&lt;ref name="countries"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/countries/en/ |title=Countries |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.) {{As of|2013}}, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and [[Tokelau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 1, Members of the World Health Organization (at 31&amp;nbsp;May 2009)|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries have been granted [[observer status]]. [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is an observer as a "national liberation movement" recognized by the [[League of Arab States]] under United Nations Resolution 3118. The [[Holy See]] also attends as an observer, as does the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]].&lt;ref name="observerWHO"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xou_nD9jJF0C |title=World Health Organization |first1=Gian Luca |last1=Burci |first2=Claude-Henri  |last2=Vignes |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-411-2273-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Taiwan was invited under the name of "Republic of China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=103148&amp;ctnode=427&amp;mp=9 |title=Taiwan Today, Taiwan delegation to participate in WHA |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".&lt;ref name="countries"/&gt; Liechtenstein is currently the only UN member not in the WHO membership.

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated alongside the other NGOs.&lt;ref name="observerWHO"/&gt;

===World Health Assembly and Executive Board===
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face 2.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.&lt;ref name="governance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of the executive board is Dr. [[Assad Hafeez]].

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.&lt;ref name="burci53"&gt;{{harvnb|Burci|Vignes|2004|pages=53–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognized. For example, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional office]]. Each region also has a regional office.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions|website=|publisher=WHO|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011220426/http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

|}
The head of the organization is the Director-General, elected by the [[World Health Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/|title=WHO Governance|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lasts for 5 years, and Director-Generals are typically appointed in May, when the Assembly meets. The current Director-General is Dr. [[Tedros Adhanom]] Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employees ===
The WHO employs 8,500 people in 147 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we are |url= http://www.who.int/employment/about_who/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the principle of a tobacco-free work environment, the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we need|url=http://www.who.int/employment/who_we_need/en/|publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously instigated the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html |title=Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodwill Ambassadors ===
The WHO operates "[[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassadors]]"; members of the arts, sports, or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO's initiatives and projects. There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors ([[Jet Li]], [[Nancy Brinker]], [[Peng Liyuan]], [[Yohei Sasakawa]] and the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project ([[Craig David]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/goodwill_ambassadors/en/ |title=Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country and liaison offices===
The World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/index.html |title=WHO its people and offices |publisher=WHO |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the [[European Union]], United Nations and a single office covering the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. It also operates the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] in [[Lyon]], France, and the [[WHO Centre for Health Development]] in [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offices include those in [[Pristina]]; the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of Serbia; there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"/&gt; The WR is member of the [[United Nations System|UN system]] country team which is coordinated by the UN System [[Resident Coordinator]].

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices" /&gt; The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title = WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing and partnerships ===
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&amp;nbsp;million), Japan ($58&amp;nbsp;million), Germany ($37&amp;nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&amp;nbsp;million) and France ($31&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title = Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format = PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&amp;nbsp;million, of which $944&amp;nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&amp;nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&amp;nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2002}}, a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal "official relations" – the rest being considered informal in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/livingproofproject/Pages/gavi.aspx |title=Living Proof Project: Partner Profile |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundations |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance |title=World Health Organization's Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research |publisher=Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate=31 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710062352/https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance|archivedate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the World Health Organization headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in 2008.]]
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). A selective reading of this document (clause 3) can result in the understanding that the IAEA is able to prevent the WHO from conducting research or work on some areas, as seen hereafter. The agreement states here that the WHO recognizes the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds that 

"whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations |url = http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]]) to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. They believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |title=World Health Organization Accomodates &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |work=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928232353/http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However as pointed out by Foreman&lt;ref&gt;M.R.StJ. Foreman, Cogent Chemistry, Reactor accident chemistry an update, 2018, 
10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944, https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944&lt;/ref&gt; in clause 2 it states.

“2. In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its agreement with the United Nations together with the exchange of letters related thereto, and taking into account the respective co-ordinating responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized by the World Health Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the primary responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co- ordinating research and development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world without prejudice to the right of the World Health Organization to concern itself with promoting, developing, assisting and co-ordinating international health work, including research, in all its aspects.”

Clearly suggesting that the WHO is free to do as it sees fit on nuclear, radiation and other matters which relate to health.

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&amp;nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |work=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the [[Catholic Church]] remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], has condemned [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict's]] opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermittent preventive therapy ===
The aggressive support of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized |website=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet and sugar intake ===
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916).&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half and said that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News: WHO: Daily sugar intake 'should be halved'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-26449497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 swine flu pandemic===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts and health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/influenza/clinical_evaluation_tables/en/|title=Tables on clinical evaluation of influenza vaccines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pandemic involving the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1 influenza virus]] was declared by the then Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2009/06/who-declares-pandemic-novel-h1n1-virus|title=WHO declares pandemic of novel H1N1 virus|work=CIDRAP|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/|title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abelina A | year = 2011 | title = Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1) The research-based vaccine industry's perspective | url = http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue =  6| pages = 1135–1138 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.042 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 21115061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009120413/http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | archivedate = 9 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and reform efforts===
Following the [[2014 Ebola outbreak]] in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Split WHO in two: strengthening political decision-making and securing independent scientific advice|journal=Public Health Journal|date=February 2014|volume=128|issue=2|pages=188–194|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.021|pmid=24434035|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(13)00291-6/pdf|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of "core capacity" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100&amp;nbsp;million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|title=Report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|title=WHO Calls For $100 Million Emergency Fund, Doctor 'SWAT Team'}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it had received $26.9&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).  WHO has budgeted an additional $494&amp;nbsp;million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_30-en.pdf|title=Reform of WHO's work in health emergency management / WHO Health Emergencies Programme|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|title=WHO Aims To Reform Itself But Health Experts Aren't Yet Impressed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCTC implementation database===
The WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is one of the only mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220023429/http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database/ |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national implementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report "As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (eg, database indicated “yes” when report indicated “no”), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hoffman S.J. |author2=Rizvi Z. | year = 2012 | title = WHO's Undermining Tobacco Control | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9843| pages = 727–728 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61402-0 | pmid=22920746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IARC controversies ===
{{Further|International Agency for Research on Cancer}}
The World Health Organization sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has been criticized for the way it analyses the tendency of certain substances and activities to cause cancer and for having a politically motivated bias when it selects studies for its analysis. Ed Yong, a British science journalist, has criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Beefing With the World Health Organization's Cancer Warnings|last=Yong|first=Ed|work=The Atlantic|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Kuntz, a French director of research at the&amp;nbsp;[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the agency for its classification of potentially carcinogenic substances. He claimed that this classification did not take into account the extent of exposure: for example, red meat is qualified as probably carcinogenic, but the quantity of consumed red meat at which it could become dangerous is not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slate.fr/story/126602/pourquoi-fausses-sciences-gouvernent-monde|title=Pourquoi les fausses sciences gouvernent le monde (et pourquoi il faut mettre un terme à ce règne)|work=Slate|access-date=29 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies have erupted multiple times when the IARC has classified many things as Class 2a (probable carcinogens), including cell phone signals, [[glyphosate]], drinking hot beverages, and working as a barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-idUSKCN1261WS|title=Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=6 October 2016|agency=Reuters|location=London, U.K.|access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Block of Taiwanese participation===
Political pressure from China has led to Taiwan being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in both 2017 and 2018 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the [[World Health Assembly|WHO annual assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China warns Taiwan of continued lockout from WHO assembly|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/china-warns-taiwan-of-continued-lockout-from-who-assembly/2017/05/21/0a486d66-3e58-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Bows to China Pressure, Contravenes Human Rights in Refusing Taiwan Media|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/95982|website=international.thenewslens.com|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, 172 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] wrote to the Director General of the World Health Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Members Push for Taiwan's Participation at World Health Assembly|url=https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/172-members-push-for-taiwans-participation-at-world-health-assembly/|website=foreignaffairs.house.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel expenses===
According to [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], the WHO routinely spends about $200&amp;nbsp;million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Malaria]] combined. In 2016, [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of WHO from November 2006 to June 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 May 2017|location=Geneva|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed in a $1000 per night hotel room while visiting West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/1cf4791dc5c14b9299e0f532c75f63b2/AP-Exclusive:-Health-agency-spends-more-on-travel-than-AIDS| title=Health agency spends more on travel than AIDS| first=Maria| last=Cheng| date=22 May 2017| accessdate=27 June 2017| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Mugabe's role as a goodwill ambassador ===
On 21 October 2017, the Director General [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]] appointed former Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]] as a [[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|WHO Goodwill Ambassador]] to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe.

The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41702662|title=Robert Mugabe's WHO appointment condemned as 'an insult'|date=21 October 2017|work=''BBC News''|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://theglobeandmail.com/news/world/shock-as-zimbabwes-mugabe-named-who-goodwill-ambassador/article36681266/ | title=WHO chief 'rethinking' appointment of Zimbabwe's Mugabe as 'goodwill ambassador' after widespread condemnation | work=The Globe and Mail | date=21 October 2017 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41713919 | title=WHO cancels Robert Mugabe goodwill ambassador role |work=''BBC News''| date=22 October 2017 |  accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World headquarters ==
The seat of the organization is in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. It was designed by Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and inaugurated in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/modernizing-who-headquarters.pdf|title=MODERNIZING THE WHO HEADQUARTERS IN GENEVA|website=who.int|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the organization launched an international competition to redesign and extend its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/design-contest-opens-for-world-health-organisation-headquarters/8664906.article|title=Design contest opens for World Health Organisation headquarters|work=Architects Journal|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
