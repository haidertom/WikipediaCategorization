'''Additional funds needed''' (AFN) is a [[Financial accounting|financial]] concept used when a business looks to expand its operations. Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new [[assets]] that will be needed to increase sales.

==Calculation==
AFN is a way of calculating how much new [[funding]] will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN. 

A simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;code&gt;AFN = Projected increase in assets – spontaneous increase in liabilities – any increase in retained earnings&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.

If a negative value is found for AFN, that means that the action would generate extra [[income]] that could be invested elsewhere. 

The AFN equation is as follows: 

AFN = (A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – (L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(RR)&lt;ref&gt;Brigham, E.F., and M. Ehrhardt. 2008. ''Financial Management: Theory and Practice'', 12th ed. Thomson South-Western, Mason, OH. {{ISBN|978-0-324-42269-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

A* = Assets tied directly to sales and will increase

L* = Spontaneous liabilities that will be affected by sales. (NOTE: Not all liabilities will be affected by sales such as long-term debt)

S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Sales during the last year

S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Total sales projected for next year (the new level of sales).

ΔS = The increase in sales between S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

M = Profit margin, or the profit per unit of sales

MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Projected [[Net Income]]

RR = The retention ratio from Net Income and is also calculated as (1 – payout ratio)

The relevant ratios within the formula are:

(A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the capital intensity ratio

(L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio

An '''appraiser''' (from Latin ''appretiare'', "to value"), is one who determines the fair market [[Value (economics)|value]] of [[property]], [[real property|real]] or [[personal property|personal]]. In [[England]] the business of an appraiser is usually combined with that of an [[auctioneer]], while the word itself has a similar meaning to that of "valuer."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appraiser|volume=2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In the [[United States]], the most common usage relates to real estate and personal property appraisals, while the term is often used to describe a person specially [[wikt:appointment|appointed]] by a [[judicial]] or quasi-judicial [[authority]] to put a valuation on property, ''e.g.'' on the items of an [[inventory]] of the Tangible Property of an Estate (IRS law) of a deceased person or on land taken for public purposes by the right of [[eminent domain]]. Appraisers of imported goods and boards of general appraisers have extensive functions in administering the customs laws of the United States. Merchant appraisers are sometimes appointed temporarily under the revenue laws to value where there is no resident appraiser without holding the office of appraiser (U.S. Rev. Stats. § 2609).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''Artifact-centric business process model'''  represents an operational [[business process model|model of business processes]] in which the changes and evolution of [[business data]], or [[Business entity (computer science)|business entities]], are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, also called activity-centric or process-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is change/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.

== Overview ==
In general, a process model describes activities conducted in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. [[Workflow]]s, as a typical [[process modeling]] approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., [[control flow]]s), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.

Business process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the “correct” realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.

Intuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.

== Research and history ==
Artifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell&lt;ref&gt;Nigam, A. and N.S. Caswell, Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification. IBM Syst. J., 2003. 42(3): p. 428-445.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here.&lt;ref name="BH2005"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., A model-driven approach to industrializing discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 2005. CCCT CCCEC(1): p. 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH2007"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., et al., Towards Formal Analysis of Artifact-Centric Business Process Models, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 288-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIU2007"&gt;Liu, R., K. Bhattacharya, and F. Wu, Modeling Business Contexture and Behavior Using Business Artifacts, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2007. p. 324-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="BH2005" /&gt; described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al.&lt;ref name="LIU2007"/&gt; formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al.&lt;ref name="BH2007"/&gt; provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaran, S., R. Liu, and F. Wu, On the Duality of Information-Centric and Activity-Centric Models of Business Processes, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2008. p. 32-47.&lt;/ref&gt; presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.

Other approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"&gt;[[Van der Aalst, W.M.P.]], [[Mathias Weske|M. Weske]], and D. Grünbauer, Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support. Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, 2005. 53(2): p. 129-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WANG2005"&gt;Wang, J. and A. Kumar, A Framework for Document-Driven Workflow Systems, in Business Process Management. 2005. p. 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Aalst et al.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"/&gt; provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar&lt;ref name="WANG2005"/&gt; proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al.&lt;ref name="MULLER2007"&gt;Müller, D., M. Reichert, and J. Herbst, Data-Driven Modeling and Coordination of Large Process Structures, in On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2007: CoopIS, DOA, ODBASE, GADA, and IS. 2009. p. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.

Another related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations.&lt;ref name="RYNDINA2007"&gt;Ryndina, K., J. Küster, and H. Gall, Consistency of Business Process Models and Object Life Cycles, in Models in Software Engineering. 2007. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding et al.&lt;ref name="REDDING2008"&gt;Redding, G., et al., Generating business process models from object behavior models. Information Systems Management, 2008. 25(4): p. 319-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Küster et al.&lt;ref name="KUSTER2007"&gt;Küster, J., K. Ryndina, and H. Gall, Generation of Business Process Models for Object Life Cycle Compliance, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt; give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.

More recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"&gt;Gerede, C. and J. Su, Specification and Verification of Artifact Behaviors in Business Process Models, in Service-Oriented Computing – ICSOC 2007. 2009. p. 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"&gt;Gerede, C.E., K. Bhattacharya, and J. Su, Static analysis of business artifact-centric operational models. Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA 2007, 2007: p. 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"&gt;Fritz, C., R. Hull, and J. Su, Automatic construction of simple artifact-based business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"&gt;Deutsch, A., et al., Automatic verification of data-centric business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerede and Su&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"/&gt; developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"/&gt; identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.

Fritz, Hull, and Su&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"/&gt; formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"/&gt; introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.

Sira and Chengfei&lt;ref name="YONGCHAREON2010"&gt;Yongchareon, S., Liu, C.: Process View Framework for Artifact-Centric Business Processes, in R. Meersman et al. (Eds.): OTM 2010, Part I. LNCS, vol. 6426, pp. 26–43. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yongchareon|first1=Sira|title=A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes|journal=Information Systems|date=2015|volume=47|pages=51–81|doi=10.1016/j.is.2014.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayasdi''' is a [[machine intelligence]] software company that offers a software platform and applications to organizations looking to analyze and build predictive models using [[big data]] or highly dimensional data sets. Organizations and governments have deployed Ayasdi's software across a variety of use cases including the development of clinical pathways for hospitals,&lt;ref name="HITNEWS-2016-03-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/intermountain-deploy-clinical-variation-management-software-ayasdi |title=Intermountain to deploy clinical variation management software from Ayasdi |publisher=Health Care IT News |date=March 2, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-[[money laundering]], fraud detection, trading strategies, customer segmentation, oil and gas well development, drug development, disease research, information security, anomaly detection, and national security applications.&lt;ref name="NYT-2013-01-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/ayasdi-a-big-data-start-up-with-a-long-history/ |title=Ayasdi: A Big Data Start-Up With a Long History |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 16, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VB-2013-01-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/16/ayasdi/#1FPlL7mgRXdxYWOX.99 |title=A cure for cancer?

Ayasdi focuses on hypothesis-free, automated analytics at scale.&lt;ref name="datanami-2016-02-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/02/01/knowing-whats-possible-a-big-obstacle-for-big-data/ |title=Knowing What’s Possible a Big Obstacle for Big Data |publisher=Datanami |date=February 1, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the Ayasdi system consumes the target data set, runs many different unsupervised and supervised [[machine learning]] algorithms on the data, automatically finds and ranks best fits, and then applies [[topological data analysis]] to find similar groups within the resultant data.  It presents the end analysis in the form of a network similarity map, which is useful for an analyst to use to further explore the groupings and correlations that the system has uncovered.  This reduces the risk of bias since the system surfaces "what the data says" in an unbiased fashion, rather than relying on analysts or data scientists manually running algorithms in support of pre-existing hypotheses.&lt;ref name=datanami-2016-01-04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/01/04/how-a-nuisance-variable-turned-into-potential-lifesaver/ |title=How a ‘Nuisance Variable’ Turned Into Potential Lifesaver |publisher=Datanami |date=January 4, 2016 |access-date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayasdi then generates mathematical models which are deployed in predictive and operational systems and applications.

Organizations using Ayasdi have found Ayasdi's automated, platform-based approach to machine intelligence to be two to five orders of magnitude more efficient than existing approaches to big data analytics, as measured in the amount of time and expense required to complete analysis and build models using large and complex data sets.  One widely reported example at a top five global systemically important bank was that to build models required for the annual [[Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review]] (CCAR) process took 1,800 person-months with traditional manual big data analytics and machine learning tools, but took 6 person-months with Ayasdi.  A project at a second global systemically important bank showed Ayasdi reducing the time to build risk models from 3,000 person-hours to 10 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==History and funding==
Ayasdi was founded in 2008 by [[Gunnar Carlsson]], Gurjeet Singh, and Harlan Sexton after 12 years of research and development at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="NYT-2013-01-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VB-2013-01-16"/&gt; While at Stanford, the founders received [[United States dollar|$]]1.25 million in [[DARPA]] and [[IARPA]] grants for "high-risk, high-payoff research".&lt;ref name="NYT-2013-01-16"/&gt; In 2012 Ayasdi landed a Series A round of funding led by [[Floodgate Capital]] and [[Khosla Ventures]] for $10.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/01/16/venture-capital-deals-272/ |title=Venture capital deals |publisher=CNNMoney |date=January 16, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171418/http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/01/16/venture-capital-deals-272/ |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2013, Ayasdi closed $30.6 million in Series B funding from [[Institutional Venture Partners]], [[GE Ventures]], and [[Citi Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayasdi.com/connect/pr-ayasdi-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-from-institutional-venture-partners-ge-ventures-and-citi-ventures.html|title=News and Events - Ayasdi|author=|date=|website=Ayasdi.com|access-date=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2015, Ayasdi announced a new $55 million round of Series C funding, led by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], and joined by four current investors, Institutional Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, Floodgate Capital, Citi Ventures, and two new investors, [[Centerview Capital|Centerview Capital Technology]] and [[Draper Nexus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayasdi.com/company/media/seriesc/|title=News and Events - Ayasdi|author=|date=|website=Ayasdi.com|access-date=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
Ayasdi is a machine intelligence platform.  It includes dozens of statistical and both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and can be extended to include whatever algorithms are required for a particular class of analysis.  The platform is extensively automated and is in production at scale at many global 100 companies and at governments in the world. It features [[Topological Data Analysis]] as a unifying analytical framework, which automatically calculates groupings and similarity across large and highly dimensional data sets, generating network maps with greatly assist analysts in understanding how data clusters and which variables are relevant.  When compared with manual approaches to statistical analysis and machine learning, results with Ayasdi will typically be achieved much faster to achieve and more accurate due to the automation and scalability built into the platform.  The Ayasdi platform also develops mathematical models, including predictive models, based on the results of the analysis. This allows Ayasdi to deployed as an operational system, or as a part of operational systems, and not just for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erin Bury|url=http://betakit.com/2013/01/16/ayasdi-comes-out-of-stealth-with-10-25m-to-answer-unknown-data-questions/ |title=BetaKit &amp;raquo; Ayasdi Comes Out of Stealth With $10.25M to Answer Unknown Data Questions | publisher=Betakit | date=January 16, 2013 |access-date=July 3, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308102846/http://betakit.com/2013/01/16/ayasdi-comes-out-of-stealth-with-10-25m-to-answer-unknown-data-questions |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayasdi can be deployed on-premises using [[Intel]]-based servers, or on either public or private cloud infrastructure. The platform runs on [[Linux]] and [[Hadoop]].

== Applications ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2018}}
Ayasdi also develops machine intelligence applications.  One example is Ayasdi Care, which is a suite of cloud-based applications for healthcare providers that is focused on managing and improving patient outcomes, revenue and population health. For example, Ayasdi clinical variation, one of the applications in Ayasdi Care, automatically discovers the ideal care paths for medical procedures based on analyzing historical patient data, billing records and insurance claims.

== Users and industries ==
Ayasdi customers include many large enterprises, medical research institutions and governments across industries including health care, financial services, oil and gas, security, life sciences, and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/darpa-backed-ayasdi-launches-with-10m-from-khosla-floodgate-to-uncover-the-hidden-value-in-big-data/ |title=DARPA-Backed Ayasdi Launches With $10M From Khosla, Floodgate To Uncover The Hidden Value In Big Data |publisher=Techcrunch |date=January 16, 2013 |access-date=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130207/srep01236/full/srep01236.html |title=Extracting insights from the shape of complex data using topology |publisher=Nature |date=September 13, 2012 |access-date=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Big Hairy Audacious Goal''' ('''BHAG''' - pronounced BEE-hag) is a [[strategic planning|strategic]] [[business statement]] similar to a [[vision statement]] which is created{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to focus an [[organization]] on a single medium- to long-term organization-wide goal which is audacious, likely to be externally questionable, but not internally regarded as impossible.

[[James C. Collins|James Collins]] and [[Jerry Porras]] coined the term "Big Hairy Audacious Goal" in their 1994 book ''[[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Collins |first1= Jim |author1-link= James C. Collins |last2= Porras |first2= Jerry I. |author2-link= Jerry Porras |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Built To Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies |year= 1994 |publisher= HarperBusiness |isbn= 0-060-56610-8 |page= 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A BHAG encourages organisations to define [[visionary (disambiguation) | visionary]] goals that are more strategic and emotionally compelling.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many{{quantify|date=October 2018}} organisations set goals that describe what they hope to accomplish over the coming days, months or years. These goals help align employees to work together more effectively.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Often these goals are very tactical, such as "achieve 10% revenue growth in the next 3 months". In contrast, Collins and Porras define a BHAG as "an audacious 10-to-30-year goal to progress towards an envisioned future".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors claim that a [[company]] may have more than one BHAG; there may be one over-reaching BHAG and other shorter-term BHAGs.

{{quote|text= "A true BHAG is clear and compelling, serves as unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a clear catalyst for [[team spirit]]. It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for finish lines."|sign= Collins and Porras|source= [[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]}}

Mahoney and McCue sound a cautionary note when assessing BHAGs, seeing them as "[w]orthwhile when relevant to the business; inspiring to employees but disappointing when dropped in a few years in favor of other goals".&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}

'''Build to order''' ('''BTO''') and sometimes referred to as '''make to order''' or '''made to order''' ('''MTO'''), is a [[Mass production|production]] approach where products are not built until a confirmed order for products is received. BTO is the oldest style of [[order fulfillment]] and is the most appropriate approach used for ''highly customized'' or ''low volume'' products. 

"Made to order" products are common in the food service industry, such as at restaurants.

==Overview==
This approach is considered good for [[Mass customization|highly configured]] products, e.g. [[automobile]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2004, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bicycles]], [[Server (computing)|computer servers]], or for products where holding inventories is very expensive, e.g. [[aircraft]].

In an automotive context, BTO is a demand driven production approach where a product is scheduled and built in response to a confirmed order received for it from a final customer.&lt;ref name=Roehrich&gt;Roehrich, J.K.; Parry, G. and Graves, A. (2011), [http://www.inderscience.com/search/index.php?action=record&amp;rec_id=40869. Implementing build-to-order strategies: enablers and barriers in the European automotive industry], ''International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management''. 11(3): 221-235&lt;/ref&gt; The final customer refers to a known individual owner and excludes all orders by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), national sales companies (NSC), dealers or point of sales, bulk orders or other intermediaries in the [[supply chain]]. BTO excludes the order amendment function, whereby forecast orders in the pipeline are amended to customer requirements, as this is seen as another level of sophistication for a [[build to stock]] (BTS) system (also known as build to forecast (BTF)).

BTS is the dominant approach used today across many industries and refers to products that are built before a final purchaser has been identified, with production volume driven by historical demand information.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; This high stock level, endemic across the auto industry allows some dealers to find an exact or very close match to the customer’s desired vehicle within the dealer networks and supplier parks. The vehicle can then be delivered as soon as transport can be arranged. This has been used to justify stock levels. Whilst providing a rapid response to customer demand, the approach is expensive, mainly in terms of stock, but also transportation as finished goods are rarely where they are required. Holding stock of such a high cash value as finished goods is a key driver of the current crisis in the automotive industry - a crisis that could be eased by implementation of a BTO system.&lt;ref name=Roehrich /&gt;

A BTO system does not mean that all suppliers in the supplier chain should be producing only when a customer order has been confirmed. Clearly, it would not make economic sense for a manufacturer of low value high volume parts to employ BTO. It is appropriate that these should be identified and built to a supplier order, effectively BTS. Part of the challenge in a BTO supplier network is in the identification of which suppliers should be BTO and which BTS. The point in the supply chain when this change occurs is called the ‘decoupling point’. Currently, the majority of automotive supply chains lack a decoupling point and the dominant BTS approach has resulted in billions of dollars of capital being tied up in stock in the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms build all their products to order while others practice (BTS). Given the widespread proliferation of products, there are a number of [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] taking a combined approach, where some items are BTS and others are BTO, which is commonly referred to as "hybrid BTO".&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2001, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantages of the BTO approach in environments of high product variety is the ability to supply the customer with the exact product specification required, the reduction in sales discounts and finished good inventory, as well a reduction in stock obsolescence risk. The main disadvantage of BTO is manufacturers are susceptible to market demand fluctuations leading to a reduced capacity utilization in manufacturing. Hence, to ensure an effective use of production resources, a BTO approach should be coupled with proactive demand management. Finding the correct and appropriate balance of BTO and BTS to maintain stock levels appropriate to both the market requirement and operational stability is a current area of academic research.

Related approaches to BTO include the Engineer to Order (ETO) approach, where after an order is received, a part of or the whole design is done, as well as the Assemble to Order (ATO). Together with the BTS approach, these strategies form the spectrum of [[order fulfillment]] strategies a firm can adopt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1606">'''Build to stock''', or '''make to stock''', often abbreviated as '''BTS''' or '''MTS''', is a build-ahead production approach in which production plans may be based upon sales forecasts and/or historical demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parry|first=Glenn|last2=Graves|first2=Andrew|title=Build to order: the road to the 5-day car|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-84800-224-6|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtOiA6aW7VAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTS is a usually associated with the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] [[mass production]] techniques, where in anticipation of demand vast quantities of goods are produced and stocked in warehouses.

==Overview==
Build to stock is frequently considered as an appropriate solution for products where there are few product lines and long changeover times between costly products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Build to Stock Inventory model|url=http://www.leanmanufacture.net/operations/buildtostock.aspx|work=leanmanufacture.net|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms build all their products to order while others build them to stock. Given the widespread proliferation of products, there are a number of manufacturers taking a hybrid approach, where some items are built to stock and others are built to order.

Build to stock has been replaced in many industries by ''[[build to order]]'', where items are produced to specific [[sales order]]s.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
'''Business analytics''' ('''BA''') refers to the skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title= Next Generation Business Analytics
 |url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/7486045/Next-Generation-Business-Analytics-Presentation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on [[data]] and [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. In contrast, [[business intelligence]] traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the two sentences|date=October 2017}}

Business [[analytics]] makes extensive use of statistical analysis, including explanatory and [[predictive modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | title=Predictive vs. Explanatory Modeling in IS Research | author=Galit Schmueli and Otto Koppius | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011082717/http://www.citi.uconn.edu/cist07/5c.pdf | archivedate=2010-10-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fact-based management to drive [[decision making]]. It is therefore closely related to [[management science]]. Analytics may be used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. Business intelligence is [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[report]]ing, [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP), and "alerts."

In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, and alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next (predict), and what is the best outcome that can happen (optimize).&lt;ref name=Davenport2007&gt;{{Cite book

==Examples of application==
Banks, such as [[Capital One]], use [[data analysis]] (or ''[[analytics]]'', as it is also called in the business setting), to differentiate among customers based on [[credit risk]], usage and other characteristics and then to match customer characteristics with appropriate product offerings. [[Harrah's Entertainment|Harrah’s]], the gaming firm, uses analytics in its [[customer loyalty]] programs. [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]] quantitatively analyses and predicts the appeal of its wines. Between 2002 and 2005, [[Deere &amp; Company]] saved more than $1 billion by employing a new analytical tool to better optimize inventory.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;  A telecoms company that pursues efficient call center usage over customer service may save money as well.

==History==
Analytics have been used in business since the management exercises were put into place by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in the late 19th century. [[Henry Ford]] measured the time of each component in his newly established assembly line. But analytics began to command more attention in the late 1960s when computers were used in [[decision support systems]]. Since then, analytics have changed and formed with the development of [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, [[data warehouses]], and a large number of other software tools and processes.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

In later years the business analytics have exploded with the introduction to computers. This change has brought analytics to a whole new level and has brought about endless possibilities. As far as analytics has come in history, and what the current field of analytics is today, many people would never think that analytics started in the early 1900s with Mr. Ford himself.

==Challenges==
Business analytics depends on sufficient volumes of high quality data. The difficulty in ensuring data quality is integrating and reconciling data across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available.&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;

Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of [[forecasting]] [[consumer behavior]] by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |title= Choosing the Best Storage for Business Analytics |publisher= Dell.com |accessdate= 2012-06-25 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120718204914/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/best-storage-business-analytic.aspx |archivedate= 2012-07-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time.

==Competing on analytics==
[[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics:&lt;ref name="Davenport2007"/&gt;
* One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics
* Widespread use of not only [[descriptive statistics]], but also predictive modeling and complex [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] techniques
* Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes
* Movement toward an enterprise level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities

[[File:PigotDirectory1839Kent.jpg|thumb|An example page from [[Pigot's Directory|Pigot's 1839 directory]] of businesses in the counties of Kent, Surrey and Sussex in England.]]
A '''business directory''' is a website or [[print media|printed]] listing of [[information]] which lists businesses within niche based categories. Businesses can be categorized by niche, location, activity, or size. Business may be compiled either manually or through an automated online search software. Online [[yellow pages]] are a type of business directory, as is the traditional [[phone book]].

The details provided in a business directory may vary. They may include the business name, addresses, telephone numbers, location, contact information, type of service or products the business provides, the number of employees, the served region and any [[professional association]]s. Some directories include a section for user reviews, comments, and feedback. Business directories in the past would take a printed format but have recently been upgraded to websites due to the advent of the internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Many business directories offer complimentary listings in addition to the premium options. There are many business directories and some of these have moved over to the [[internet]] and away from printed format. Whilst not being [[search engine]]s, business directories often have a search function, enabling users to search businesses by [[Zip Code]], country, state, area or city.

== Formats ==
Business directories can be in either [[hard copy]] or in [[Digital formats|digital format]]. Ease of use and distribution means that many trade directories have a digital version.

'''Business metadata''' is data that adds business context to other data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It provides information authored by business people and/or used by business people.  It is in contrast to [[technical metadata]], which is data used in the storage and structure of the data in a [[database]] or system. Technical metadata includes the database table name and column name, data type, indexes referencing the data, [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] jobs involving the data, when the data was last updated, accessed, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
According to noted author and columnist Lowell Fryman, "The essence of business metadata is in reducing or eliminating the barriers of communication between human and human, as well as human and computer, so that the data conveyed from reports, information systems, or business intelligence applications can be crystal clear, can facilitate business operations, and can be leveraged for all business decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/news/2240111047/What-is-metadata-Solutions-for-leveraging-technical-and-business-metadata|title=What is metadata? Solutions for leveraging technical and business metadata|work=SearchDataManagement|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Linstedt, creator of the [[Data vault modeling|Data Vault]] methodology, says business metadata "...provide[s] definition of the functionality, definition of the data, definition of the elements, and definition of how the data is used within business...business metadata includes business requirements, time-lines, business metrics, business process flows, and business terminology."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/linstedt/archives/2006/07/technical_versu.php|title=Technical versus Business Metadata - classifications - Blog: Dan E. Linstedt - BeyeNETWORK|website=www.b-eye-network.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business metadata is important because it can greatly facilitate the usefulness of the data to business people.  A simple example of business metadata is a glossary entry.  Hover functionality in an application or web form can enable a glossary definition to be shown when cursor is on a field or term.

Other examples of business metadata include annotation ability within applications.  For example, a business user may be viewing a [[business intelligence]] (BI) report and notice a trend in the data.  The user may have background knowledge as to why this trend occurs.  Some business intelligence tools enable the user to create an annotation within the report that explains the trend.  Such an annotation can enhance other users' understanding of the data.  This example is especially powerful because it is created by a business user for the use of other business people.

== Examples ==
Other examples of business metadata are:
* Business rules
* Data quality rules
* Valid values for reference data
* Wikis 
* Collaboration software

The '''chief operating officer''' ('''COO'''), also called the '''chief operations officer''', is one of the highest-ranking executive positions in an organization, comprising part of the "[[C-Suite]]". The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the [[company]],&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp|title=Chief Operating Officer – COO|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive, usually the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).&lt;ref name=Levinson1993&gt;{{Citation|title=Between CEO and COO|jstor=4165123|year=1993|author=Levinson, Harry|journal=Academy of Management Executive|pages=71–83|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COO is usually the [[second in command]] at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the [[Chairman]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]].

==Responsibilities and similar titles==
Unlike other [[C-Suite]] positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, the COO job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.&lt;ref name=hbr2006&gt;{{Citation|title=Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating Officer|url=http://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer/ar/1|year=2006|journal=Harvard Business Review|pages=70–79|volume=84|issue=5|last1="Miles"|first1=Stephen A.|last2="Bennett"|first2=Nathan|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the selection of a COO is similar to the selection of a [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] or [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the President or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and CEO" or "President and COO") is also loosely defined. The President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various Vice Presidents (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. 

Lloyd E. Reuss was President of [[General Motors]] from 1990 to 1992, as the right-hand man of Chairman and CEO [[Robert C. Stempel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|title=Lloyd and Mark Reuss: Father and Son – Generations of GM|website=history.gmheritagecenter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630175729/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Lloyd_and_Mark_Reuss:_Father_and_Son|archive-date=2017-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stempel insisted on naming Reuss as company president in charge of North American operations, the board reluctantly agreed but showed their displeasure by not giving Reuss the title of COO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp Practice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021525/http://www.cg.org.cn/english/practice/GM.asp |date=November 2, 2013 }}.

[[Richard D.

[[Michael Capellas]] was appointed President of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in order to ease its acquisition and integration of [[Compaq]], where Capellas was previously Chairman and CEO. Capellas ended up serving just six months as HP president before departing. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dignan |first=Larry |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/networks/2002/11/12/capellas-leaves-hp-11036342/ |title=Capellas leaves HP &amp;#124; Networks |publisher=silicon.com |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403041405/http://www.silicon.com/technology/networks/2002/11/12/capellas-leaves-hp-11036342/ |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itjungle.com/mid/mid111302-story01.html |title=Guild Companies |publisher=Itjungle.com |date=2002-11-13 |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325164459/https://www.itjungle.com/mid/mid111302-story01.html |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the investment banking firms of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when [[James Cayne]] was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

[[Tom Anselmi]] of [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] was Chief Operating Officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of [[Richard Peddie]] and the hiring of [[Tim Leiweke]] for the posts of President and CEO, Anselmi added the title of President from September 4, 2012 to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Damien|title=Maple Leafs: New era of MLSE intrigue unfolding: Cox|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/article/1252698--a-new-era-of-mlse-intrigue-unfolding|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Fuld]], the chairman and CEO of [[Lehman Brothers]], had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as President and Chief Operating Officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as President and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the Office of the Chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&amp;nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/|title=Print Page|website=nymag.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008 and replaced as President and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Ward2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="truell"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html?pagewanted=print| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| first=Peter| last=Truell| title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm| date=November 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas W. LaSorda]] served as President and CEO of [[Chrysler]] from January 1, 2006 to August 5, 2007 while Chrysler was owned by [[Daimler-Benz]]. When [[Cerberus Capital]] bought majority control of Chrysler, [[Bob Nardelli]] was appointed [[Chairman]] and CEO of Chrysler while LaSorda became Vice Chairman and President. Despite the appointment of a second Vice Chairman and President, [[Jim Press]], LaSorda stayed on.&lt;ref name="detnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122054107/http://www.detnews.com/article/20090502/AUTO01/905020344/1148/LaSorda+s+legacy+is++unselfish+devotion+ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=He led GM"s quality and lean manufacturing activities as a corporate VP |publisher=The Detroit News |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/cerberus-buys-chrysler.html |title=The Cerberus Takeover of Chrysler |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaSorda's titles as Vice Chairman and President officially stated that he was in charge of manufacturing, procurement and supply, employee relations, global business development and alliances. However, LaSorda's actual role was to find a new partner or buyer for Chrysler, leading to speculation that Cerberus Capital was less interested in rebuilding the auto manufacturer than it was to turning profit though a [[leveraged buyout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/trans-canada-highway/so-long-lasorda/article785654/|title=So long, LaSorda|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Walt Disney Company]] has used the [[List of management of The Walt Disney Company#Presidents|President and COO]] titles in varied ways for their number two executive.  [[Ron W. Miller]] was President from 1978 to 1984, while serving additionally as CEO for 18 months from 1983 to 84.  [[Frank Wells]] was President from 1984 to 1994, where he reported to the board of directors and not Chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. When Wells died in a helicopter crash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/obituaries/frank-wells-disney-s-president-is-killed-in-a-copter-crash-at-62.html|title=Frank Wells, Disney's President, Is Killed in a Copter Crash at 62|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; no replacement President was named as his duties were resumed by Eisner. [[Michael Ovitz]] was President from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. [[Bob Iger]] was President and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. [[Thomas O. Staggs]] was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

[[Manulife]] has used the President and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco "Roy" Gori served as President where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the Chief Investment Officer. Gori reported to Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017 upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the Chief Operating Officer, reported to the President on Corporate Strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including Corporate Development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, Human Resources, Regulatory and Public Affairs, Global Resourcing and Procurement, and the Global Program Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/manulife-appoints-roy-gori-as-president-617424583.html|title=Manulife appoints Roy Gori as President|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current situation===
Some modern companies operate without a COO.  For example,  in 2007 almost 58% of [[Fortune 500]] companies did not have a COO.&lt;ref name=Gerut2010&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub [[C-Suite]] executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO.&lt;ref name=Marcel2009&gt;{{Citation

* Companies are becoming more deliberate about [[CEO succession]] planning and will use the role to on-board and train successors.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* The increase in talent mobility means that the role will likely be used more often as a retention mechanism for key executives who are at risk of moving to a competitor.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs.&lt;ref name=Ward2010&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A COO could also be brought in from other organizations as a "fixer," such as Daniel J. O'Neill who in 1999 joined Molson in that capacity.&lt;ref name=Molson&gt;{{Citation

In the [[manufacturing sector]], the primary role of the COO is routinely one of [[operations management]], meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's [[product (business)|products]]. The COO is responsible for ensuring that [[business operations]] are efficient and effective and that the proper [[Resource management|management of resources]], [[supply chain management|distribution of goods and services to customers]] and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and Board of Directors, marshaling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching/corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, Knowledge-Skills-Attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the [[heir apparent]] to the CEO.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2009&gt;{{Citation

Either way, the position is used as a training and testing ground for the next CEO.

A 2003 Crist Associates study revealed that only 17% of companies that promote a COO to a CEO replace the COO within the next year.&lt;ref name=Martin2003&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including:
* '''Not being automatically granted the luxury of a "diagnostic period."''' Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* '''Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board.''' Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the Board of Directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* '''Being in the spotlight.''' COOs are used to having the luxury of working "behind the scenes." As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a "public" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* '''Recalibrating their image.''' Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an "execution" executive versus a "strategy" executive.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO "heir" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

==Relationship with CEO==

Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Seven strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO-COO relationship include:&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006&gt;{{Citation

# Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
# Clear Decision Rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
# Lock on the Backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
# Sharing the Spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much "credit" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the Board of Directors, and from each other.
# Fit between CEO &amp; COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
# Fit Between the COO &amp; the Position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
# Transparency of Succession Expectations and Timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board.&lt;ref name=Miles2007&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director.&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt;  Researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO.  For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEOs, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an "operations" person or a "Number 2" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the Board of Directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt; Harry Levinson, Ph.D., effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: "The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power."&lt;ref name=Levinson1993 /&gt;

==Experts and research==
Nathan Bennett and [[Stephen A. Miles]] have published extensively on the subject of the COO. In addition to writing a book dedicated to analyzing this hard-to-understand position,&lt;ref name=shotgun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miles, Stephen A.|author2=Nathan Bennett|title=Riding shotgun: the role of the COO|publisher=Stanford Business Books|location=Stanford, Calif|year=2006|pages=|isbn=0-8047-5166-8|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their research has been published in the ''Harvard Business Review'', ''MIT Management Review'' and Chief Executive.net.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt; Their work focuses on identifying different types of COOs, when the role works to deliver additional value, and when the role fails to produce the desired results. Their research includes interviews with more than a hundred CEOs and COOs on the topic.

'''Colocation''' (or '''co-location''') is the act of placing multiple (sometimes related) entities within a single location.

==Examples==
* In an organization, it refers to placing related roles or groups in a single room, building or campus.
* In business, it refers to the practice of locating multiple similar businesses in the same facility.
* In trading, it often refers to placing multiple data centers in proximity to trading centers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedtrading.com/ivyschmerken/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=YAMNAXILVBKFVQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=220300263&amp;pgno=2 High-Frequency Trading Shops Play the Colocation Game], ''Advanced Trading'', Ivy Schmerken.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In telecommunications, primarily wireless telecommunications facilities such as mobile wireless (cell sites) and radio broadcasting, it refers to the practice of locating multiple wireless broadcast facilities/providers within the same facility. Many jurisdictions now mandate colocation of mobile wireless carriers within a single facility to avoid the proliferation of wireless communication towers.
* In the [[fast food restaurant]] industry, one primary use of this concept is [[Yum! Brands]] with its [[KFC]], [[Taco Bell]], and [[Pizza Hut]] menus appearing in the same restaurant. All of the [[WingStreet]] chain locations are co-located with [[Pizza Hut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeywcIPd7ScC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Yum!+brands+and+colocation+of+its+restaurant&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CHg-09XOn1&amp;sig=HrFos6lNMOhIcCmw3x6Hivm5rlw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6teDck4fZAhVBuBQKHdZEBIgQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Yum!%20brands%20and%20colocation%20of%20its%20restaurant&amp;f=false|title=Student Achievement Series: Principles of Management|last=Griffin|first=Ricky W.|date=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=|isbn=0618730788|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In the retail sector, [[Sears Holdings]] often operates its large format [[Sears]] stores with an income tax services office, an optical shop, and other independent operations. [[Walmart]] is also known for this, in addition to including fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] or [[Dunkin' Donuts]] within its stores.
* In the airline industry, colocation commonly occurs at [[airports]]. Airline alliances will be assigned or build a fortress out of certain terminals or dominant carrier-specific terminals; [[Star Alliance]] in particular makes colocation in a single terminal alliance policy (termed "Move Under One Roof"). An example would be at Tokyo's [[Narita Airport]], where local carrier [[All Nippon Airways]], a Star Alliance member, and its partners operate in one terminal to facilitate partner connections and product offerings, even offering combined check-in, member lounges, and ground services.

==Data==
Colocation is often used in the data sourcing industry to mean off-site data storage, usually in a [[data center]]. This is very important for businesses since the loss of data can be crucial for companies of any size, up to and including disciplinary action for employees or loss of their job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/616422/Fear_of_Data_Loss_Social_Media_Security_Risks_Rising Fear of Data Loss, Social Media Security Risks Rising], ''CIO Magazine'', Joan Goodchild, 20 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An unexpected loss in data can result from fires, earthquakes, floods, or any sort of natural disaster.

Data colocation technology began to take hold in the telecommunications industry. Colocation enables multiple customers to access network, server, and data storage space, connecting them to a variety of service providers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140116134017/http://resources.cio.com/ccd/assets/18525/detail Colocation: The Logical Home for the Cloud], ''[[Computerworld]]'', Cyrus One.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communication quotient''', '''communication intelligence''', or '''CQ''' is a [[Business philosophy|theory]] that [[communication]] is a [[behaviour]] based skill that can be measured and trained.  CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another.  The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals.  The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of [[Information Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 at [[TED conference|TED]] Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|url=http://www.tedwomen.aol.com/2010/10/03/clare-munn/|work=Clare Munn at TEDWomen|publisher=TEDWomen|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of [[IQ]] as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by [[Howard Gardner]] with his [[Theory of multiple intelligences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Howard|title=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|url=https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465025102|work=Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences|publisher=New York|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gardner's view, traditional types of [[intelligence]], such as IQ, fail to fully explain [[cognitive ability]].  The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], a trend led by [[Daniel Goleman]]’s [[emotional intelligence]] and social intelligence.

==Definition==
''[[The Times of India]]'' in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Shift from IQ|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/A-Shift-from-IQ/articleshow/1010684.cms|work=A Shift from IQ|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=Improving Your Communication Quotient|url=http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/CQ.htm.|work=Improving Your Communication Quotient|publisher=Expressions of Excellence|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Clare Munn and [[Maria Bello]] defined CQ as "Expressive &amp; Receptive Intelligence" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munn|first=Clare|title=Social Media's Value Proposition Might Just be CQ|url=http://claremunn.com/2009/04/cq-social-medias-value-proposition/|work=CQ: Expressive and Receptive Intelligence|publisher=Clare Munn|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in ''The CQ Manifesto'' defined CQ as  "saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CQ Institute - What is CQ?|url=http://www.cqinstitute.com/CQ/what_is_cq.htm|work=The CQ Manifesto - Communication Intelligence: the 5 professional personas that will transform your work life and super-charge your organisation|publisher=CQ Institute|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals.  Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks.  The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Service|first=Robert|title=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/journalsProdDesc.nav?prodId=Journal201676&amp;crossRegion=antiPod|work=CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals|publisher=Journal of Information Science|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Corporate DNA''''' is [[business jargon]] for [[organizational culture]]. It is a metaphor based on the biological term ''[[DNA]]'', the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions in living organisms.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5}}

In a 1997 book, Gareth Morgan defined the corporate DNA metaphor as the "visions, values, and sense of purpose that bind an organization together" to enable individuals to "understand and absorb the mission and challenge of the whole enterprise".{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=95}} Lindgreen and Swaen define it as an "organization's culture and strategy".{{sfn|Lindgreen|Swaen|2010}} Ken Baskin defines it as "flexible, universally available database of company procedures and structures" which develops from the company's history, and that the organization's employees behave to satisfy the resultant corporate identity.{{sfn|Mason|2006|ps=This corporate DNA is built from past history and Baskin believes that people act in ways to fulfil a company's identity due to the corporate DNA}} Baskin also likens the availability of information throughout an organization to the presence of DNA in all of an organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1999}} [[Arnold Kransdorff]] defines corporate DNA as the set of institution-specific experiences that "characterizes any organization's ability to perform".{{sfn|Kransdorff|2006|p=Back cover}}&lt;!-- similar claims are in the text, but I don't have access to it --&gt;

==Definition==
In a ''[[Strategy+Business]]'' article, Gary Neilson, Bruce A. Pasternack, and Decio Mendes state that the four DNA bases for an organization are its structure, decision rights, motivating factors, and information.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} In the book ''DNA Profiling : The Innovative Company: How to Increase Creative Ability in Business'', Isabelle Denervaud and Olivier Chatin state that the four organizational bases are actors, ideation, emotion, and collaboration.{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=17-18}} Denervaud and Chatin also extend the metaphor by identifying factors that may mutate organizational DNA (discontinuity, traditional playing fields, new lands, and individuals),{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5, 19}} much like a genetic [[mutation]] may change the [[nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] of the [[genome]] of an organism, and Neilson, Pasternack, and Mendes describe a company adapting to structural and environmental changes analogous to biological [[adaptation]].{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} The term DNA is also used to describe an organization's ability to [[innovation|innovate]].{{sfn|Galt|2010}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=15}}

In ''Corporate Culture: The Ultimate Strategic Asset'', Eric Flamholtz and Yvonne Randle state that organization culture is "transmitted to generations of employees" via that organization's DNA,{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} and that the DNA of the culture of the company is established "during its initial stages" reflecting the "personal and professional values" of the founders.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} They also state that it can be "transformed through the entrance of new people with new ideas",{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=194}} and that significant differences in organizational performance can be derived from small changes in organizational DNA.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=24}} According to Virginia Healy-Tangney, such changes must come throughout the organization and are time-consuming.{{sfn|Healy-Tangney|2013}} These changes may result in increased [[productivity]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], and in a reduction of [[Turnover (employment)|employee turnover]].{{sfn|Asplund|Blacksmith|2012}}

Preservation of organizational DNA is important to ensure business continuity and persistence. Organizations have implemented various techniques to prevent organizational DNA from being controlled by external influences, such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] remaining [[Privately held company|privately owned]] to limit control of [[share capital]].{{sfn|Nurdin|2011|p=180}} Another method is by branding corporate work environments to "clearly reflect the culture" of the organization.{{sfn|Haynes|2012}}

&lt;!-- this needs better phrasing --&gt;
DNA is used to describe the skills, properties, or qualities of an individual that describe that individual's character.{{sfn|Dyer|Gregersen|Christensen|2011}}
{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011}}

The term is also used to describe the set of architectural and spatial characteristics considered by the [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitants]] of a city to be constituents of that city's [[Cultural identity|identity]].{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} This may include "materials and colours, a typical arrangement of scale and architectural forms, building lot size, roof lines, scale of public and semi-public spaces" which should be respected by new buildings and urban spaces in the city.{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} In an article in ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', Kelli Richards claims that the organizational culture at [[Apple Inc.]] in the 1990s has become part of the DNA of [[Silicon Valley]].{{sfn|Richards|2012}}

'''Corporate jargon''', variously known as '''corporate speak''', '''corporate lingo''', '''business speak''', '''business jargon''', '''management speak''', '''workplace jargon''', '''corporatese''' or '''commercialese''', is the [[jargon]] often used in large [[corporation]]s, [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]], and similar workplaces.&lt;ref name="Garner2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bryan A. Garner]]|title=[[Garner's Modern American Usage]]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd3byNeBdR4C|accessdate=21 March 2013|edition=3rd|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-987462-0|pages=168–69|chapter=Commercialese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/going-forward-corporatese-should-be-confined-to-the-dustbin-20170316-guzxvi.html|title=Going forward, corporatese should be confined to the dustbin|last=Linnell|first=Garry|date=17 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, [[euphemism]]s, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an [[argot]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;"corporate argot" in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116165746415401680 The Jargon Jumble: Kids Have 'Skeds,' Colleagues, 'Needs'], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 24 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to "[[spin doctor|spin]]" negative situations as positive situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Marketing speak''' is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in [[marketing]] [[press releases]], [[advertising copy]], and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Examples ==
{{See also|Glossary of business and management terms|List of buzzwords}}

Many terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, ''[[deliverable]]'' is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The phrases ''going forward'' or ''moving forward'' make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Legal terms such as "[[Chapter 11]]" can be used without explaining what they are about: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about [[Bankruptcy in the United States|US bankruptcy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A '''corporate promoter''' is a firm or person who does the preliminary work incidental to the formation of a company, including its [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], and [[Initial public offering|flotation]], and solicits people to invest money in the company, usually when it is being formed. An [[investment banker]], an [[underwriter]], or a [[stock promoter]] may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
Generally, promoters are in a [[fiduciary relationship]] with the company and its [[investor]]s and  [[shareholder]]s, and must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]s and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.

A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.

The fiduciary duties of promoters include:

* not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Pomoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members.
* to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company.

If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.

A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.

==Types of promoters==
Promoters may be classified into the following types.

===Professional promoters===
There are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.

===Occasional promoters===
These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.

===Entrepreneur promoters===
They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.

===Financial promoters===
Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.

==Functions of promoters==
The functions of a promoter may include:

===Discovery of a business idea===
The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .

===Detailed investigation===
Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.

===Assembling the factors of production===
If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.

===Entering into preliminary contracts===
The promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">'''Customer knowledge''' ('''CK''') is the combination of experience, value and insight information which is needed, created and absorbed during the transaction and exchange between the [[customer]]s and enterprise.&lt;ref name=gebert2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gebert|first1=Henning|last2=Geib|first2=Malte|last3=Kolbe|first3=Lutz|last4=Riempp|first4=Gerold|url=http://iceb.nccu.edu.tw/proceedings/2002/PDF/f262.pdf|title=Towards customer knowledge management: Integrating customer relationship management and knowledge management concepts|journal=The Second International Conference on Electronic Business (ICEB 2002)|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell (2003) defines customer knowledge as: "organized and structured information about the customer as a result of systematic processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Campbell, A. J.|year=2003|title=Creating customer knowledge competence: Managing customer relationship management programs strategically|journal=Industrial marketing management|volume=32|pages=375–383|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(03)00011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitussis et al. (2006), customer knowledge is identified as one of the more complex types of knowledge, since customer knowledge can be captured from different sources and channels.&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khosravi|first1=Arash|last2=Che Hussin|first2=Ab Razak|title=A Review of Customer Knowledge Management Importance|journal=Journal of Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=45–52 |url=http://www.jscdss.com/index.php/files/article/view/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darryn Mitussis|author2=Lisa O'Malley|author3=Maurice Patterson|title=Mapping the re-engagement of CRM with relationship marketing|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=40|issue=5/6|pages=572–589|doi=10.1108/03090560610657840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Various classifications exist:
Gebert et al. (2002), classified customer knowledge from an organization's perspective into three types:&lt;ref  name=gebert2002/&gt;
#knowledge about customers: is gained mainly by [[service management]], offer management, [[complaint management]] and, if available, contract management. The main user processes of knowledge regarding the customer are campaign management and service management, because both processes personalize their services based on user criteria. Knowledge about the customer must be transparent within the company; although its distribution beyond the border of the company must be controlled, as this type of knowledge can often be directly transformed into competitive advantages. The development of such knowledge is also expensive, because knowledge revelation is quite time-consuming.
#knowledge for customers: is mainly developed in processes within the company, for example, the research and development section or a production department. Collecting this knowledge is the responsibility of campaign management. It should be refined according to the customer requirements. It is then disseminated to the other [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) processes, mainly: contract management, offer management, and service management. CRM manages knowledge, transparency and dissemination of knowledge for customers. Maintaining the balance between comprehensibility and precision is the main challenge when managing this kind of knowledge.
#knowledge from customers: can be obtained in the same ways as knowledge about customers. Capturing knowledge from customers is based on the important fact that customers who obtain  their own expertise when utilizing a service or product can be seen as equal partners. This concept is not regularly understood in the business world and its effects have been poorly researched in academia (Garcia-Murillo and Annabi, 2002).&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"/&gt;

The same categorization of customer knowledge has been made by others such as Bueren et al. (2005) and Feng and Tian (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bueren,  A., Schierholz, R., Kolbe, L., and Brenner, W.|year=2005|title=Improving performance  of  customer  processes  with knowledge management|url=https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/a080b16584a378f06199ade7ec9c25e0-en.pdf/Improving_performance_of_customer-processes_with_knowledge_management.pdf|journal=Business Process Management Journal|volume=11|issue=5|pages=573–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feng, T., Tian, J. (2005), "Customer knowledge management and condition analysis of successful  CKM  implementation", Proceedings  of  the  fourth  international Conference on machine learning and cybernetics, Guanghou, August 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In another categorization, Crié and Micheaux (2006) divide customer knowledge into two types, namely: "Behavioural" (or Quantitative) and "Attitudinal" (or Qualitative). Behavioral knowledge is easy to acquire and is basically quantitative by nature; that is, containing a customer transactional relations with the company. On the other hand, attitudinal knowledge is difficult to acquire because it deals with a customer's [[wikt:state of mind|state of mind]]; but meanwhile it is an important factor for enhancement of customer knowledge because they are directly related to a customer's thoughts and insights.

'''Employer Registration''' is the process by which a person or [[legal entity]] registers their intent to [[employ]] someone.

*Sole proprietors  
*Partnerships
*[[Corporation]]s, associations and [[Trust company|trust]]s 
*Nonprofit and charitable estates 
*Organizations and [[joint ventures]] 
*[[Limited liability companies]].

People who employ household workers can include:
*Private households  
*Local chapters of college  
*Local college clubs
*[[Fraternities]] or [[sororities]].

A '''focus group''' is a small, but  demographically diverse group of people and whose reactions are studied especially in market research or political analysis in guided or open discussions about a new product or something else to determine the reactions that can be expected from a larger population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|title=Definition of FOCUS GROUP|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504021742/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/focus+group|archivedate=4 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|title=focus group - Definition of focus group in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044025/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/focus_group|archivedate=9 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: focus group|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|date=|website=www.ahdictionary.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=focus+group|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[qualitative research]] consisting of interviews in which a group of people are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.  During this process, the researcher either takes notes or records the vital points he or she is getting from the group. Researchers should select members of the focus group carefully for effective and authoritative responses.

==History==

Focus groups have a long history and were used{{by whom|date=May 2016}} during the [[Second World War]] (1939-1945) to examine the effectiveness of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;

In library and information science, when the library intends to work on its collection, the library consults the users who are the reason the library was established. This is an important process in meeting the needs of the users.

===Social sciences===
In the [[social sciences]] and [[urban planning]], focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversation pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with [[participant observation]], they can be used for learning about groups and their patterns of interaction. An advantage is their fairly low cost compared to [[Opinion poll|surveys]], as one can get results relatively quickly and increase the sample size of a report by talking with several people at once.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine and Gretchen B. Rossman. 1999. ''Designing Qualitative Research''. 3rd Ed. London: Sage Publications, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage is that they can be used as an occasion for participants to learn from one another as they exchange and build on one another's views, so that the participants can experience the research as an enriching encounter. This counteracts the extractive nature of research which seeks to "mine" participants for data (with no benefit for them) as criticized by various authors, and in particular Indigenous-oriented authors (and others sharing similar sentiments), as explained, for example, by Romm (2015): http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/2087.

===Marketing===
In the world of [[marketing]], focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products, as well as various other topics. In marketing, focus groups are usually used in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to create an overall direction for marketing initiative. In particular, focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product, to discuss, view, and/or test the new product before it is made available to the public. This can provide valuable information about the potential market acceptance of the product.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A focus group is an interview, conducted by a trained moderator among a small group of respondents. The interview is conducted in an informal and natural way where respondents are free to give views from any aspect. Focus groups are similar to, but should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to guide the discussion.  Generally the discussion goes from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses.

Participants are recruited on the basis of similar demographics, psychographics, buying attitudes, or behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenbaum |first=Thomas|title=Moderating Focus Groups|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-2044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the stake holder (often a design team in the case of testing acceptance on a new product) are not involved in the focus group, not to bias the exercise. However they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras, or by watching through a one way mirror.

Traditional focus groups can provide accurate information, and are less expensive than other forms of traditional [[marketing research]]. There can be significant costs however: if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be critical to gather respondents from various locales throughout the country since attitudes about a new product may vary due to geographical considerations. This would require a considerable expenditure in travel and lodging expenses. Additionally, the site of a traditional focus group may or may not be in a locale convenient to a specific client, so client representatives may have to incur travel and lodging expenses as well.

Today, using [[audience response]] keypads to collect questionnaire answers is the new industry trend.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Usability engineering===
* In [[usability engineering]], a focus group is a survey method to collect the feedback of users on software or a website. This marketing method can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Unlike other methods of [[ergonomics]], focus group implies several participants: users or future users of the application. The focus group can only collect subjective data, not objective data on the use of the application as the [[usability test]] for example.

==Types==
Variants of focus groups include:
* '''Two-way focus group''' - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion
* '''Dual moderator focus group''' - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered
* '''Dueling moderator focus group''' (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion
* '''Respondent moderator focus group''' - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily
* '''Client participant focus groups''' - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly
* '''Mini focus groups''' - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12
* '''Teleconference focus groups ''' - telephone network is used
* '''Creativity groups'''
* '''Band obsessive group'''
* '''[[Online focus group]]s''' - computers connected via the internet are used

==Discussions==
* Group discussion produces data and insights that would be less accessible without interaction found in a group setting—listening to others’ verbalized experiences stimulates memories, ideas, and experiences in participants. This is also known as the group effect where group members engage in "a kind of ‘chaining’ or ‘cascading’ effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it" (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182)&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof, T. R., &amp; Taylor, B. C. (2002). ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods, 2nd Edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of "native language" or "vernacular speech" to understand the situation
* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of [[workplace bullying]], targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying therefore serve as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, &amp; Alberts, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, S. J., Lutgen-Sandvik, P., &amp; Alberts, J. K. (2006). Nightmares, demons and slaves: Exploring the painful metaphors of workplace bullying. ''Management Communication Quarterly, 20'', 148-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and criticism==
A fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of [[qualitative research]]) is the issue of ''observer dependency'': the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her own reading of the group's discussion, raising questions of validity (see [[experimenter's bias]]).
Focus groups are "One shot case studies" especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences, unless they are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmais, Chava Frankfort; Nachmais, David. 2008. ''Research methods in the Social Sciences: Seventh Edition'' New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Donald T., Stanley, Juilian C. ''Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research.'' Chicago, IL: Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common (and related) criticism involve [[groupthink]] and [[social desirability bias]].

Another issue is with the setting itself.  If the focus groups are held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator's questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear.  Another issue with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity.  With all of the other participants, there can not be any guarantee of confidentiality.

[[Douglas Rushkoff]]&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas, ''Get back in the box : innovation from the inside out'', New York : Collins, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; argues that focus groups are often useless, and frequently cause more trouble than they are intended to solve, with focus groups often aiming to please rather than offering their own opinions or evaluations, and with data often [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cites the disastrous introduction of [[New Coke]] in the 1980s as a vivid example of focus group analysis gone bad.

Jonathan Ive, Apple’s senior vice president of industrial design, also said that Apple had found a good reason not to do focus groups: "They just ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Data analysis==
The analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Jamie|title=Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish|isbn=978-0-85702-138-0|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that data should be analysed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data – particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.

Focus group data provides the opportunity to analyse the strength with which an individual holds an opinion.  If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.

At the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views.  However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view can be assumed to agree with the majority, or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Jamie. 2013. ''Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish'' London, SAGE Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States government==
The [[United States]] federal government makes extensive use of focus groups to assess public education materials and messages for their many programs.  While many of these are appropriate for the purpose, many others are reluctant compromises which federal officials have had to make as a result of studies independent of whether a focus group is the best or even appropriate methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srivastava|first1=T N|title=Business Research Methodology|isbn=0-07-015910-6|page=6.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Swedish artist [[Måns Wrange]] has used the concept of the focus group in his work ''The Good Rumor Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manswrange.com|title=Måns Wrange|author=|date=|website=www.manswrange.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050721/http://www.manswrange.com/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance the focus group situation is used not only as a means to investigate the opinions of the group members, but also to spread an idea (the ''rumor'') across society with the help of the group members.

== Exercises ==
Various creative activity-oriented questions can serve as supplements to verbal questions including but not limited to the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colucci|first=Erminia|date=December 2007|title=Focus groups can be fun": The use of activity-oriented questions in focus group discussions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Qualitative Health Research|volume=17 |issue=10|pages=1422–1433|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509164640/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.833.1072&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Free listings'''- participants produce a list of all elements of a domain 
* '''Rating'''- participants have a list of items which must be rated on a scale, typically using a numbers or adjectives
* '''Ranking'''- participants can either receive a list of items to rank according to a specified dimension or participants can combine items in pairs to compare elements in the pairs
* '''Pile sorting'''- participants sort cards representing elements of a domain into piles according to their similarities and differences
* '''Picture sort'''- Participants are distributed selected pictures from magazines or photographs to sort through, finding matches of a definite characteristic or that best represent a certain category
* '''Magic tools and fantasy'''- the moderator can literally or symbolically pass around a "magical" tool to each participant as he or she shares a fantasy, dream, or idea
* '''Storytelling'''- participants create a narrative around the topic of interest to make others think about a solution to a problem, gauge reactions to a situation, and observe attitudes towards the topic under study
* '''Role-playing'''- participants demonstrate through action how they would behave or act in a situation, how they would solve a problem, or deal with a difficulty
* '''Sentence completion'''- participants are given printed out partial sentences on a topic to complete and share within a group
* '''Collage'''- a moderator assigns a theme and then distributes print materials to participants (who are divided into small groups), so they can use these materials, drawings, and their own words to create a relevant collage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18128">A founder-CEO is an individual who founds a firm and holds its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] position.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Teresa|date=2003-08-01|title=The persistence of founder influence: management, ownership, and performance effects at initial public offering|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.328/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=24|issue=8|pages=707–724|doi=10.1002/smj.328|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the firm's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] is not a founder or the founder [[CEO succession|CEO is succeeded]], the firm is said to be led by a non-founder CEO or [[CEO succession|successor CEO]]. Research has highlighted differences among founder and non-founder CEOs that influence [[Return on investment|firm performance]]. These differences include: [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[Equity stake|equity stake in the firm]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]], and outlook towards [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, founder CEOs outperform their non-founder CEO counterparts in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]]. They tend to take a long-term view and consider their firm their lifetime achievement, resulting in them holding a larger [[equity stake]] in their firm than non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Darius Palia, S. Abraham Ravid, and Chia-Jane Wang developed this idea further and concluded that founder CEOs become less influenced by managerial incentives as they continue to devote resources to their firm whereas the opposite is true for non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs are less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performance according to managerial incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars such as Joon Mahn Mahn Lee, Jongsoo Jays Kim, and Joonhyung Bae, concluded that founder CEOs continually invest in new projects and explore new knowledge that will benefit the firm in the long-term, suggesting that the existence of a founder CEO is correlated with a greater [[Research and development|innovation investment]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In terms of [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]], Fahlenbrach, along with other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs partake in a greater number of acquisitions within their [[core business]] line each year as they have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|tolerance for risk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This additional risk taken on by founder CEOs stems from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level which some scholars have measured through their tone in tweets, regarding both [[Earnings call|earnings announcements]] and personal statements, and their [[Option (finance)|option exercise behavior]] relative to non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Founder [[CEO succession]] can occur through both voluntary and involuntary means. Noam Wasserman found in majority of founder CEO successions, the founder is forced to step down by investors. Founder CEOs who successfully execute [[New product development|product development]] or enter into negotiations with potential outside investors for additional capital have a higher likelihood of being replaced than those who are not as successful with product development and/or do not to raise additional capital. Indicated by several scholars, like Wasserman, as the CEO becomes successful in product development the needs of the firm expand and a mismatch between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward is likely to occur, increasing the probability of succession.  Founder CEOs are generally succeeded by someone from outside the firm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Founder CEO comebacks have occurred when the founder CEO was replaced and later returned to their role as CEO.

== Founder imprinting  ==

A person or several people can be founders of the firm. The founders earn the founder title once the firm becomes [[Operational definition|operational]] at which point their founder role ends. Founders do not have a particular role post founding, but their influence continues as they designed the firm's blueprint impacting structures and decision-making going forward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== US firms ==
Eleven percent of US [[Market capitalization|large cap firms]] are led by founder CEOs, including well-known companies such as [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]],  [[FedEx|Fedex]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Negative and positive contributions to firm performance  ==
Several differences identified in research exist between firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs. Identified differences include [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[equity stake]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]] and participation in [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In November 2009, [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]] named [[Steve Jobs]], founder of [[Apple Inc.]], CEO of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/23/decade-steve-jobs-apple/|title=The Decade of Steve Jobs (Fortune, 2009)|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six runners-up, all founder CEOs, were: [[Bill Gates]], [[Warren Buffett]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Bernard Madoff]], [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/05/fortune-magazine-names-apples-steve-jobs-ceo-of-the-decade/|title=Fortune magazine names Apple’s Steve Jobs CEO of the decade|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock performance  ===
According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, firms led by founder CEOs outperform those led by non-founder CEOs, in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]].  Between the time period of 1993 and 2002 an [[Portfolio (finance)|equally weighted portfolio]], consisting of companies led by founder CEOs, would have earned an annual benchmark-adjusted return of 8.3%. In other words, an [[Abnormal return|excess abnormal return]] of 4.4% annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahlenbrach|first=Rüdiger|date=2009-01-01|title=Founder-CEOs, Investment Decisions, and Stock Market Performance|jstor=40505931|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|volume=44|issue=2|pages=439–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016, 16 companies in the [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500]] still have founder CEOs, who have been with the company for at least 5 years. In aggregate, these companies have generated a 5-year average [[Rate of return|return]] of 170%, significantly greater than the 56% 5-year S&amp;P 500 gain.  Of these companies, 14 have outperformed the market over the past three years. These companies include: [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]], [[Under Armour]], [[Nvidia]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Starbucks]], [[Regeneron|Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]], [[L Brands]], [[Verisign|VeriSign]], [[FedEx]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Akamai Technologies]], [[Intercontinental Exchange]], and [[SanDisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/28/19-companies-excel-founders-charge/82343660/|title=Founders make great CEOs. Here's why|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity stake  ===
Fahlenbrach, like many other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs have a larger [[equity stake]] in the firm, potentially reducing the [[Principal–agent problem|principal agent problem]].  Founder CEOs consider their firm their lifetime achievement and therefore take a long-term view. This approach results in the [[Shareholder value|optimal shareholder-value maximizing strategy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Managerial incentives  ===
Incentive structures do differ for firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs as a result of different pay performance sensitivity as concluded by several scholars including Palia, Ravid, and Wang. A statistically significant relationship is present between these two variables for firms led by non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs tend to be less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performances according to their pay incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Meanwhile, this relationship is insignificant for founder CEOs, who become less influenced to pay incentives as they devote more time and energy to their firm.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palia|first=Darius|last2=Ravid|first2=S. Abraham|last3=Wang|first3=Chia-Jane|date=2008-02-01|title=Founders versus non-founders in large companies: financial incentives and the call for regulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|journal=Journal of Regulatory Economics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=55–86|doi=10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|issn=0922-680X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This founder CEO attachment to their firm results in lower salaries, which can be seen in a study completed by Noam Wasserman on 528 ventures between the years 1996 and 2002. This results of this study concluded that more than half, 51%, of founder CEOs make either the same salary or one that is lower than someone who reports to them. Additionally, the results showed that founder CEOs receive 20% less in cash compensation than their non-founder CEO counterparts with similar experience.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma|title=The Founder’s Dilemma|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation investment ===
Scholars have indicated that founder CEOs experience greater [[innovation]] performance than non-founder CEOs, who tend to be [[Risk-averse|risk averse]]. Extant research attributes these differences in [[Research and development|innovation investment]]  to founder CEOs taking a long-term approach, continually investing in new projects, and exploring new knowledge. Thus suggesting that founder CEOs are not as concerned with [[job security]] or impacted by short term performance, therefore, resources are dedicated to long-term resources. Lee, Kim, and Bae found that the existence of a founder CEO is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with a 31 percent increase in the citation-weighted [[patent]] count before controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]] and a 23 percent increase after controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn Mahn|last2=Kim|first2=Jongsoo Jays|last3=Bae|first3=Joonhyung|date=2016-01-01|title=Are Founder CEOs Better Innovators? Evidence from S&amp;P 500 Firms|url=http://proceedings.aom.org/content/2016/1/13311|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=2016|issue=1|page=13311|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.2016.13311abstract|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers and acquisitions  ===
Fahlenbrach, along with others concluded founder-CEOs have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|risk tolerance]] and partake in a greater number of [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] per year than non-founder CEOs.  The [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] that founder-CEOs make do not diversify their portfolio as the acquisitions tend to be within their [[core business]]es.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Joon Mahn Lee, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, and Hailiang Chen suggested that the additional risks taken on by founder-led firms stem from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Founder CEO overconfidence ====
Founder-CEOs overconfidence may have negative or positive effect on their firms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Stephen X.|last2=Cueto|first2=Javier|date=2015-11-09|title=The Study of Bias in Entrepreneurship|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/etap.12212|journal=Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=419–454|doi=10.1111/etap.12212|issn=1042-2587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a study completed on the [[S&amp;P 1500|S&amp;P 1500 firms]] by Lee, Hwang, and Chen, it was concluded that founder CEOs use fewer negative words in both personal tweets and statements regarding [[Earnings call|earnings]]. This optimism was observed to exist at the executive level as well. Founder CEOs also provide more optimistic earnings estimates than their non-founder counterparts. Investors are unaware of this [[overconfidence bias]] among founder CEOs and take them at face value indicating no discount taken into consideration in the [[financial market]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn|last2=Hwang|first2=Byoung-Hyoun|last3=Chen|first3=Hailiang|date=2017-03-01|title=Are founder CEOs more overconfident than professional CEOs? Evidence from S&amp;P 1500 companies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2519/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=751–769|doi=10.1002/smj.2519|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 study completed by researchers at Purdue University, this overconfidence was seen when 3,000 entrepreneurs, founders, claimed there was an 81% chance of success for them and only a 59% chance for peers. One in three of these entrepreneurs believed they had a 100% success rate going forward.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Option (finance)|options]], which are tied to firm performance, were taken into account in Lee, Hwang, and Chen's study to measure overconfidence as most CEOs, founders or non-founders, are compensated in [[Option (finance)|options]] to an extent. When analyzing option-exercise behavior using the value of [[Vesting|vested in-the-money]] options to the total compensation, they concluded that founder CEOs had a significantly greater ratio. By comparison, they concluded that non-founder CEOs generally exercise their [[Option (finance)|options]] immediately when they become exercisable in-the-money to receive cash and remove their compensation linkage to future performance. Founder CEOs, however, hold off on exercising their in-the-money options as they are overly optimistic about the firm's future performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Founder CEO succession  ==

=== Occurrence ===
In the three years subsequent to the firm being founded, Wasserman concluded 50% of founder CEOs step down. The following year, another 10% step down and by the time the firm has an [[initial public offering]] less than 25% of founders still hold the CEO position.  This being said, the decision to step down is not always voluntary, four out of five founder CEOs are forced to relinquish their role as CEO by investors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Events affecting replacement likelihood ===
As indicated in Wasserman's study and others, founder CEOs experience higher turnover when they:
# Successfully execute [[New product development|product development]]. Thus, the quicker the founder CEO leads the firm to success in product development, the quicker they will be replaced. As the needs of the firm expand with product development, a mismatch is likely to occur between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward.
# Enter negotiations with potential investors for additional capital. As [[Investor|personal investors]] (family and friends), [[angel investor]]s, and [[venture capitalists]] invest in the firm, founder CEOs must often give up some control. It is also possible that potential investors will make their investment in the firm contingent upon the appointment of a new CEO. This occurs when the investors do not trust the founder CEO's ability to lead the company longer term. The likelihood of this happening is higher when the amount of capital needed is higher and outsiders have a larger equity stake in the firm, giving them more control in these decisions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=Noam|date=2003-03-01|title=Founder-CEO Succession and the Paradox of Entrepreneurial Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|journal=Organization Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=149–172|doi=10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|issn=1526-5455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founder CEO successor origin ===
Wasserman concluded that founder CEOs are almost always replaced by someone outside the organization (outside successor) opposed to someone inside (inside successor). Smaller and younger firms turn tend to turn to outsiders whereas in larger firms the [[board of directors]] is disinclined to appoint an outsider successor CEO unless the firm has experienced poor past performance. Relative to inside successors, outside successors are known to make more changes within the firm altering the firms overall business strategy, earn higher compensation, and achieve higher inter-organizational status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Founder CEO comeback ===
A founder CEO comeback can be defined as a founder CEO who relinquished their role as CEO and later returns to the position. A study completed by Ryan Krause, Abhijith G. Acharya, and Jeffrey G. Covin, on fourteen high-profile [[Fortune 1000]] comeback firms, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Starbucks]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Dell]], [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], [[PeopleSoft|Peoplesoft]] and [[Google]], identified five key conditions attributable to a founder-CEO comeback. The conditions include: poor performance, unplanned succession, founder on board, founder ownership, and interdependent board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Acharya|first2=Abhijith G.|last3=Covin|first3=Jeffrey G.|date=2014-12-01|title=Here I come to save the day: Proposing necessary and sufficient conditions for founder-CEO comeback|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673414000055|journal=Journal of Business Venturing Insights|volume=1–2|pages=26–30|doi=10.1016/j.jbvi.2014.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''information broker''' or '''data broker''' collects information about individuals from [[public records]] and private sources including [[census]] and [[change of address]] records, [[motor vehicle]] and [[driving]] records, [[User-generated content|user-contributed material]] to [[social networking sites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.propublica.org/article/yes-companies-are-harvesting-and-selling-your-social-media-profiles|title = Yes, Companies Are Harvesting – and Selling – Your Facebook Profile|last = Beckette|first = Lois|date = 9 November 2012|work = |accessdate = 17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[News story|media]] and court reports, [[voter registration]] lists, consumer purchase histories, [[Most wanted list|most-wanted]] lists and terrorist watch lists, [[payment card|bank card transaction records]], health care authorities, and [[Web browsing history|web browsing histories]].&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/2013/12/testimony-what-information-do-data-brokers-have-on-consumers/|title=Congressional Testimony: What Information Do Data Brokers Have on Consumers?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The data are [[Aggregate data|aggregated]] to create individual profiles, often made up of thousands of individual pieces of information such as a person's age, race, gender, height, weight, marital status, religious affiliation, political affiliation, occupation, household income, net worth, home ownership status, investment habits, product preferences and health-related interests. Brokers then sell the profiles to other organizations that use them mainly to target advertising and marketing towards specific groups, to verify a person's identity including for purposes of fraud detection, and to sell to individuals and organizations so they can research people for various reasons.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf|title = DATA BROKERS: A Call for Transparency and Accountability|date = May 2014|accessdate = 13 August 2014|website = Federal Trade Commission|publisher = Government of the United States|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data brokers also often sell the profiles to government agencies, such as the FBI, thus allowing law enforcement agencies to circumvent laws that protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=Reining in Private Agents|journal=Minnesota Law Review|date=2016|volume=101|pages=279–331|ssrn=2869439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Beginning in the late twentieth century, technological developments such as the development of the [[internet]], increasing computer processing power and declining costs of [[Computer data storage|data storage]] made it much easier for companies to collect, analyze, store and transfer large amounts of data about individual people. This gave rise to the information broker or data broker industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = Big data: seizing opportunities, preserving values|url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|date = |publisher =Executive Office of the President |website = |accessdate = Aug 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610084800/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals generally cannot find out what data a broker holds on them, how a broker got it, or how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq |title=Online Information Broker FAQ |work= Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=privacyrights.org |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some data brokers retain all information indefinitely.

Files on individuals are generally sold in lists; examples cited in testimony to the U.S. Congress include lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia, financially vulnerable people, people with HIV, and police officers (by home address).&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; Less controversial are lists of rich people, doctors, or parents.

There are probably between 3500 and 4000 data broker companies, and about a third may provide opt-outs, with some charging over a thousand dollars for them.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

Data brokers collect information concerning myriad topics, ranging from the daily communications of an individual to more specialized data such as product registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd. (UK)|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brokers and datasets ==
Data brokers in the United States include [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Experian]], [[Alliance Data#Epsilon|Epsilon]], [[CoreLogic]], [[Datalogix]], [[inome]], [[PeekYou]], [[Exactis]], and [[Recorded Future]].&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"&gt;http://educationnewyork.com/files/rockefeller_databroker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Acxiom claims to have files on 10% of the world's population,&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; with about 1500 pieces of information per consumer&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; (quoted in [[Senate.gov]]).&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; In 2017, [[Cambridge Analytica]] claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets&lt;ref name="InkJun2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies |title=Aadhaar in the hand of spies Big Data, global surveillance state and the identity project |author=Govind Krishnan V. |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017 |publisher=Fountain Ink Magazine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826163725/https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies/ |archivedate=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another 2017 claim is 230 million Americans&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==
Credit scores were first used in the 1950s, but did not become widely known or specifically regulated until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

In 1977 [[Kelly Warnken]] published the first fee-based information directory, which continues to be published and has expanded to cover international concerns.

==Criticism==
A U.S. Senate Committee in 2013 published ''A Review of the Data Broker Industry: Collection, Use, and Sale of Consumer Data for Marketing Purposes''.&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; It states that "Today, a wide range of companies known as “data brokers” collect and maintain data on hundreds of millions of consumers, which they analyze, package, and sell generally without consumer permission or input." Their main findings were that:
*Data brokers collect a huge volume of detailed information on hundreds of millions of consumers.
*Data brokers sell products that identify financially vulnerable consumers.
*Data broker products provide information about consumer offline behavior to tailor online outreach by marketers.
*Data brokers operate behind a veil of secrecy.

The information produced by data brokers has been criticized for enabling discrimination in pricing, services and opportunities. For example, a May 2014 White House report found that web searches that included black-seeming first names such as Jermaine were more likely to result in ads being displayed that include the word "arrest," compared with web searches including white-seeming first names such as Geoffrey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An Online Information Broker FAQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq|title=Online Information Broker FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] (PRC), a nonprofit consumer organization in the United States. PRC also maintains a list of information brokers (data brokers, with links to their privacy policies, terms of service, and opt-out privisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-information-brokers-list|title=- Privacy Rights Clearinghouse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data brokers have also faced legal charges for security breaches due to poor data security practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/03/agency-announces-settlement-separate-actions-against-retailer-tjx|title=Agency Announces Settlement of Separate Actions Against Retailer TJX, and Data Brokers Reed Elsevier and Seisint for Failing to Provide Adequate Security for Consumers Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calls for regulation and legislation ==
A 2007 [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] study, after requesting and analyzing information-sharing practices at 86 companies, found many operating under an [[opt-out]] model that it described as inconsistent with consumer expectations, and recommended that the [[California State Legislature|California state legislature]] require companies to disclose their information-sharing policies using clear, unambiguous language, and consider creating a centralized, user-friendly method for consumers to opt out of information-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 1137990|title = Consumer Information Sharing: Where the Sun Still Don't Shine|last = Hoofnagle, and Jennifer King|first = Chris Jay|date = 17 December 2007|journal = (working paper)|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |archiveurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission|U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] had recommended the U.S. Congress develop legislation enabling consumers to see the information that data brokers hold about them, a recommendation it renewed in subsequent reports in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also called for Congress to consider legislation.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTC"&gt;{{cite web|title=TC Recommends Congress Require the Data Broker Industry to be More Transparent and Give Consumers Greater Control Over Their Personal Information|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/05/ftc-recommends-congress-require-data-broker-industry-be-more|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation attempts==
The [[Data Accountability and Trust Act]] contained a number of requirements for auditing and verification of accuracy of data held by information brokers, and additional measures in the case of a security breach. The bill also gave identified individuals the means and opportunity to review and correct the data held that related to them. It passed through the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[111th Congress]], but failed to pass the [[United States Senate]]. It was revived by the [[112th Congress]] in 2011 as H.R. 1707.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1707 Data Accountability and Trust Act (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 1707)]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2013-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; but died after being referred to committee. The bill was first introduced by Rep. [[Bobby Rush]] [D-IL1] on Apr 30, 2009, H.R. 2221&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr2221 |title=Data Accountability and Trust Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2221) |publisher= govtrack.us |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
In [[fiction]], information brokers usually find data for a story's main character(s). Fictional information brokers can be of varying importance and have varying methods. For example, a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] can be an information broker, though they may be simply transferring whatever information they find to the main character(s). Other brokers may have [[memorize]]d data and tell the main character(s) [[covert]]ly. Also, a fee is not always involved. The information broker may have an alliance with the main character(s) or be one themselves.

Examples of information brokers in contemporary fiction would be [[Edward G. Robinson]]'s character Sol in the film ''[[Soylent Green]]''; the Shadow Broker in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]''; Nicholas Wayne, Rachel, Elean Duga, Gustav St. Germain, Carol, and the President of the Daily Days newspaper company in ''[[Baccano!]]''; or Izaya Orihara in the light novel series ''[[Durarara!!]]''. A few of the characters in [[Neil Stephenson]]'s novel [[Snow Crash]] find work selling data as "stringers" for the Central Intelligence Corporation. Information broker characters play a prominent role in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The character trope is best exemplified by the superhero [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], but the trope is later used with the characters [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], [[Wendy and Marvin|Proxy]], [[Chloe Sullivan]], and [[Felicity Smoak]] as well.

'''Inside contracting''' is the practice of hiring contractors who work inside the proprietor's factory.  It replaced the [[putting out system]], where contractors worked in their own facilities.  Inside contracting was the system favored by the [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harper's Ferry]] Armories.  Since the manufacturing system developed in the armories also became popular (the [[American system of manufacturing]]), manufacturers in the early 19th century tended to hire people trained in the armories as managers.  They brought with them the practice of inside contracting.

The manufacturer hired inside contractors and provided materials and machinery.  Each inside contractor was expected to hire his own employees and meet certain production and quality goals, but everything else was left to him.  As a result, the system rewarded ingenuity, but also rewarded local optimization.  For example, it was to the inside contractor's benefit to allow machinery to deteriorate toward the end of his contract since maintenance was costly and he might not reap the long-term benefit if he didn't get another contract.  The system was eventually replaced with the [[factory system]], in which everyone was an employee of the manufacturer directly.

The '''Ivey Purchasing Managers Index''' ('''IPMI''') is jointly sponsored by the [[Purchasing Management Association of Canada]] (PMAC) and the [[Richard Ivey School of Business]]. The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index measures month-to-month changes in dollars of purchases as indicated by a panel of purchasing managers from across [[Canada]].

It was founded by [[Jack Welch]], former CEO of [[General Electric]]. The company is headquartered outside of [[Washington D.C.]] at Strayer University's corporate office - 2303 Dulles Station Blvd, Herndon, VA 20171.

==History==
The Jack Welch Management Institute was developed in 2009 by former [[General Electric|GE]] CEO Jack Welch in partnership with [[Chancellor University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Jack Welch MBA Coming to Web |author=Paul Glader

===Acquisition by Strayer University===

In April 2011 Welch approached [[Strayer University]] to discuss moving the institute to the university.&lt;ref name=Mandavia&gt;{{cite news |title=Strayer buys management school started by former GE executive Jack Welch |author=Megha Mandavia and A.

In June 2012, the Jack Welch Management Institute announced the appointment of Daniel Szpiro as Dean.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strayer.edu/news/10948-jwmi-names-award-winning-instructor-dean&lt;/ref&gt; Szpiro had previously been the Associate Dean for Executive Education at the [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management]] at [[Cornell University]].

==Programs==

The institute offers an accredited [[Master of Business Administration]]&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt; and executive certificates&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; covering various business-related topics&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite news |title=Look out, B-schools: Jack Welch is moving in |author=John A.

Welch developed the curriculum, drawing from his management experience as CEO of GE and his experience teaching managers and executives at GE's Leadership Development Center.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gloeckler/&gt; In addition to helping shape the program's curriculum, he holds the title of distinguished professor at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwmi.com/content/about-jwmi-jack-welch |title=About Jack Welch |author= |date= |work=Jack Welch Management Institute |publisher=Strayer Education, Inc. |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He regularly addresses students via [[Streaming media|video stream]], and holds a [[Video conferencing|video conference]] with them at the end of each term.&lt;ref name=Glader&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Management Guru Jack Welch Talks About Digital Education, Online MBAs &amp; Modern CEOs With WA. |author=Paul Glader |url=http://www.wiredacademic.com/2011/11/exclusive-management-guru-jack-welch-talks-about-digital-education-online-mbas-modern-ceos-with-wa/ |newspaper=Wired Academic |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315084409/http://www.wiredacademic.com/2011/11/exclusive-management-guru-jack-welch-talks-about-digital-education-online-mbas-modern-ceos-with-wa/ |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JWMI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwmi.com/content/executive-mba-jacks-involvement |title=Executive MBA Jack's Involvement |author= |date= |work=Jack Welch Management Institute |publisher=Strayer Education, Inc. |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welch expects the relatively low tuition and flexible schedule for the institute's MBA program to make the program attractive to those currently employed but wishing to earn an MBA.&lt;ref name=Gloeckler/&gt;  He has stated that he plans to grow the institute into the number one online business school in the world by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Strayer Buys Jack Welch For-Profit |author=Antoine Gara |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11308403/1/strayer-buys-jack-welch-for-profit.html

'''Knowledge process outsourcing''' ('''KPO''') 

(Outsourcing of job that require knowledge,skill, expertise. The work in KPO involves process like market research, survey analysis, data mining etc. ).             information-related business activities&lt;ref name="Ivey"&gt;{{cite web|title=The benefits and risks of knowledge process outsourcing |publisher=Ivey Business Journal |url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/strategy/the-benefits-and-risks-of-knowledge-process-outsourcing |date=May–June 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191917/http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/strategy/the-benefits-and-risks-of-knowledge-process-outsourcing |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are competitively important or form an integral part of a company's [[value chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sourcing cheaper staff the new groth industry|publisher=The Sidney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/sourcing-cheaper-staff-the-new-growth-industry-20120127-1qlou.html|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mierau"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mierau|first=Alexander|title=Strategic Importance of Knowledge Process Outsourcing|publisher=Technical University of Kaiserslautern|url=http://www.hrotoday.com/pdf/white-papers/Strategic-Implications-of-KPO.pdf|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now, BPO moves up the value chain|publisher=The Economic Times|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-04-17/news/27485579_1_kpo-process-outsourcing-indian-bpo|date=2005-08-17|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reasons behind KPO include an increase in specialized knowledge and expertise,&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; additional value creation,&lt;ref name="Mierau" /&gt; the potential for cost reductions, and a shortage of skilled labor.&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; Regions which are particularly prominent in Knowledge Process Outsourcing include India, Sri Lanka, and Eastern Europe, especially Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States.&lt;br /&gt;KPO is a continuation of [[Business process outsourcing]], yet with rather more of business complexity. To be successful in Knowledge process outsourcing, a lot of guide is required from [[interorganizational system]].&lt;ref name="Ghosh, Biswadip"&gt;{{cite web|title= Knowledge process outsourcing|publisher=Ghosh, Biswadip, ACIS 2009 Proceedings Paper 52.|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/acis2009/52/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
KPO services include all kinds of research and information gathering,e.g. [[intellectual property]] research for patent applications; [[equity research]], business and [[market research]], legal and medical services; training, consultancy, and [[research and development]] in fields such as [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[biotechnology]]; and animation and design, etc.{{sfn|Sornarajah|Wang|2010|p=280}}

==Importance==
The developing rivalry has brought about shorter time to market cycles, and clients are getting to be more demanding regarding quality. This has constrained the firms to give operational proficiency and increase the value of their products and services. The customer can launch an item quicker and get to the market immediately. A company can lessen the complexities included in overseeing and constantly constructing information in an extensive pool of [[human resources]].{{sfn|Vijay Kumar Kaul|2011|p=150}}

== Risks and benefits ==
'''Benefits'''&lt;ref name="Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova "&gt;{{ cite web|title= Outsourcing Its Benefits, Drawbacks and Other Related Issues| publisher=Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova, Journal of American Academy of Business, Cambridge| url=http://doc.mbalib.com/view/21ad1bc5b227f95dd5e778a416b1c04f.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cost reduction
* Shortage of skilled employees
* Provides many graduates at very low cost
* High end services are provided at a lower cost to decrease unemployment and benefit their economy 
* Provide flexibility in terms of HRM &amp; time management

'''Risks'''&lt;ref name="Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova"/&gt;
* Security- Classified information about the company can be lost
* Key talent retention
* The character of the employee and the quality of the work cannot be assured
* KPO is time consuming and cannot provide a quick fix to the company seeking immediate results.
* Lack of communication between partners due to  legal, language and cultural barriers can lead to complications
*Quality of Personnel and Work Cannot Be Guaranteed  
*Shortage of Skilled Employees 
*Reduction in Communication due to Language barrier 
*Inability to protect company's intellect property 

==Differentiation from BPO==
A KPO firm requires considerably more skilled personnel than a [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] firm. Experts working in KPO keep on learning and accomplished professionals can power their aptitude to produce more incomes for the KPO firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does KPO differ from BPO |url=http://www.outsource2experts.com/PDFS/How_does_KPO_differ_from_BPO.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127102726/http://www.outsource2experts.com/PDFS/How_does_KPO_differ_from_BPO.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between a KPO firm and a BPO firm is that in a KPO firm, the customer is included amid the whole execution process.{{sfn|Vijay Kumar Kaul|2011|p=150}}

== Origin of the term ==
Out of all those who say they coined the term, Ashish Gupta, COO of Evalueserve has the best claim. Published authors have credited him for coining the term in their works.&lt;ref name="HRKPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=HR Practice Scenario in Indian KPOs |publisher=Global Business and Management Research: An International Journal |volume=1(2) |page=44 |date=2009 |url=http://www.universal-publishers.com/book.php?method=ISBN&amp;book=1599428997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In India ==
India has a large number of post-graduates, PhDs and MBAs who are involved in KPO. The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies ([[NASSCOM]]) estimated the total market size of the KPO sector in India in 2006 to be $1.5 billion.{{sfn|Contractor|Kumar|Kundu|2010|p=53}}  The year before, 2005, it had been $1.3 billion, with [[Evalueserve]] predicting that by 2010 it would be some $10 to $15 billion.{{sfn|Mehrotra|2005|p=46}}  The Indian government was predicting that by 2010 India would have 15% of the global KPO market.{{sfn|Basu|2009|p=80}}  However, [[Late-2000s recession|the global financial crisis]], coupled with domestic economic problems such as the [[initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Reliance Power]] in 2009, caused people to re-evaluate these predictions, incurring worries that India's IT, BPO, and KPO sectors &amp;mdash; which by then, combined, were $8.4 billion in [[export revenue]]s &amp;mdash; would be greatly affected by these factors.{{sfn|Varadarajan|2010|p=145&amp;ndash;146}} The worldwide KPO industry is expected to reach about US $17 billion by 2015, of which US $12 billion would be outsourced to India. Furthermore, the Indian KPO area is likewise anticipated that it will utilize more than 2, 50,000 KPO experts by 2015.&lt;ref name= "SIES"&gt;{{cite web| title= SEIS Journal of management| url= http://www.siescoms.edu/journals/siescoms/Journal1.pdf| p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===

The KPO area has a considerable measure of potential for development in India. But India confronts various difficulties to secure itself as a worldwide KPO pioneer. The real test in setting up a KPO will be to obtain skilled employees. KPO organizations include high risk and confidentiality and the greater part of the work would be outsourced from the US. The area likewise obliges larger amount of control, confidentiality and enhanced risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Challenges for Indian Companies in the Financial Services KPO Business|url= http://www.crisil.com/crisil-young-thought-leader-2005/dissertations/Smita-Bhattacharya_Dissertation.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, legal language and cultural barriers can result in genuine issues. Both organizations need to appreciate each other's corporate and national societies and find common helpful approaches to create successful participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Emergence and Potential of Knowledge Process Outsourcing in India| author= S.Venkatesh| url= http://journalijar.com/uploads/2014-01-01_011729_893.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Philippines ==
The Philippines Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) services are often called "non-voice" or back office services, referring to activities outside contact center, customer and IT support services. In 2014, the KPO sector comprised 40 percent of the country's outsourcing industry. The Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) predicts that the Philippine outsourcing sector will reach $25 billion in revenues and employ about 1.3 million people by 2016.&lt;ref name= "COSS"&gt;{{cite web| title= SourceFit| url= http://www.sourcefit.com/blog/why-the-philippines-is-emerging-as-a-leading-destination-for-knowledge-process-outsourcing#sthash.8P2V7DcX.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like India's KPO industry, the Philippine KPO sector has evolved along similar lines. Starting with contact center services and low-value back office work like data entry and IT maintenance, the country is now considered an established destination for animation and design and content/publishing KPO services (Sathe and Aradhana, Sourcingmag.com). Back office and non-voice services contributed $1.1 billion in revenues to the country's outsourcing sector in 2009. Former IBPAP executive director for information research Gillian Virata said that the Philippine KPO industry is expected to reach the same market size as the voice service sector by 2015-2016. Non-voice services are already growing at a faster rate than traditional voice services. 

===Non-voice services===
'''Banking and Finance Services''' 
The banking and financial services industry is leading KPO activity in the country, with global financial institutions providing underwriting, research and analytics, training and consulting, profit and loss, risk mitigation, and other BFSI-related services. KPO vendors also provide strategic research, market research, financial services research, analytics, and competitive intelligence monitoring. 

'''Legal Services''' 
Companies from the Philippines are expected to compete strongly with Indian providers of legal and paralegal services to the United States. Besides its cultural affinity with the West and excellent English proficiency of its talent pool, the Philippines used to be an American colony, and its laws are patterned after those of the U.S. Integreon is an established legal services provider in the country, specializing in discovery, contract management, compliance, legal research and knowledge management, intellectual property, and due diligence. 

'''Medical Services and Research and Development''' 
Many Chinese research and development pharmaceutical firms have set up offices in Metro Manila due to relatively lower rental and operating costs compared to traditional destinations. The country also has a pool of 250,000 nursing graduates, about half of which are expected to be employed in the healthcare services sector in 2016.&lt;ref name= "HIMO"&gt;{{cite web| title= Philippines Healthcare Info. Management| url= http://www.dict.gov.ph/healthcare-information-management-outsourcing-association-of-the-philippines/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animation and Design''' 
The Philippines has established itself as a successful [[Filipino cartoon and animation|Animation and Design]] outsourcing destination. The [[Animation Council of the Philippines]] estimates that global animation industry revenues have been growing at 20 to 30 percent over the past few years, increasing demand for low-cost, highly skilled creative labor. The rise of the animation outsourcing industry in the Philippines began in the early 1980s, with FilCartoons, Burbank Animation Inc. and Asian Animation setting up operations in the country and providing animation exports to foreign companies. In 2008, the Philippines had over 50 animation companies, mostly small and medium-sized companies. Larger animation companies include [[Toei Animation|TOEI Animation]], Roadrunner and [[Toon City|Toon City Animation Inc.]], which employs about 1,300 animators and artists (about 18 percent of the country's animation labor pool. Overall, the Philippines employed about 7,000 people in the animation sector in 2008 and generated up to US$97 million in 2006 and US$105 million in 2007.&lt;ref name= "THOLONS"&gt;{{cite web| title= The Philippines Animation Industry|url= http://www.tholons.com/nl_pdf/150508_philippine_Animation_Industry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hatnote|This article is about the credit card processing software. '''MCVE''' is also an acronym for [https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve "Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example".] This is an example in debugging computer software, that makes it easier to illustrate a problem.}}

'''MCVE''' is a [[credit card]] processing [[computer software]] library and interface running under the [[Red Hat]] [[operating system]], replacing Red Hat's [[CCVS]]. It can be used from [[PHP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.php.net/mcve PHP Manual Entry on MCVE]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, [[Main Street Softworks]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/ Main Street Softworks]&lt;/ref&gt; signed a contract with Red Hat to migrate the existing CCVS clientele to use MCVE. On July 2, 2003, Main Street Softworks renamed MCVE to [[Monetra]]. The following day a new version of MCVE was released carrying the new name, Monetra. Since then, they have released several new versions of Monetra and are currently in version 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">A '''man-hour''', or less commonly '''person-hour''', is the amount of [[Manual labour|work]] performed by the average worker in one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=person-hourva=person-hour |title=Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2010-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103213354/http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary |archive-date=2007-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Person-hour definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861725252 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5mS3lp?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861725252 |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in written "estimates" for estimation of the total amount of uninterrupted labour required to perform a task. For example, researching and writing a college paper might require eighty man-hours.  Preparing a family banquet from scratch might require ten man-hours.

Man-hours do not take account of the breaks that people generally require from work, e.g. for rest, eating, and other bodily functions. They only count pure labour. Managers count the man-hours and add break time to estimate the amount of time a task will actually take to complete. Thus, while one college course's written paper might require twenty man-hours to carry out, it almost certainly will not get done in twenty consecutive hours. Its progress will be interrupted by work for other courses, meals, sleep, and other distractions.

== Real-world applications ==
The advantage of the man-hour concept is that it can be used to estimate the impact of staff changes on the amount of time required for a task. This is done by [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] the number of man-hours by the number of workers available.

This is, of course, appropriate to certain types of activities. It is of most use when considering 'piece-work', where the activity being managed consists of discrete activities having simple dependencies, and where other factors can be neglected. Therefore, adding another person to a packaging team will increase the output of that team in a predictable manner. In transport industry, this concept is superseded by [[passenger-mile]] and [[tonne-mile]] for better costing accuracy.

In reality, other factors intervene to reduce the simplicity of this model. If some elements of the task have a natural timespan, adding more staff will have a reduced effect: although having two chefs will double the speed of some elements of food preparation, they roast a chicken no faster than one chef. Some tasks also have a natural number of staff associated with them: the time to chop the vegetables will be halved with the addition of the second chef, but the time to carve the chicken will remain the same.

Another example is the adage, "Just because a woman can make a baby in nine months, it does not follow that nine women can make a baby in one month." This adage is often cited in systems development to justify the belief that adding more staff to a project does not guarantee it will get done quicker.

Another problem with this model, as [[Frederick P. Brooks|Fred Brooks]] noted, is that organization, training, and co-ordination activities could more than outweigh the potential benefits of adding extra staff to work on a task, especially if considered only over a shorter time period.

== Similar units ==
The similar concept of a '''man-day''', '''man-week''', '''man-month''', or '''man-year'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/person-year Infoplease.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfaf.org/glossary/index.cfm?letter=p SFAF.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is used on large [[project]]s. It is the amount of work performed by an average worker during one day, week, month, or year, respectively.  The number of hours worked by an individual during a year varies greatly according to [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] and [[economics]]. The average annual hours actually worked per person in employment as reported by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries in 2007, for example, ranged from a minimum of 1,389 hours (in the [[Netherlands]]) to a maximum of 2,316 hours (in [[South Korea]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It is becoming more common to use the gender-neutral "person-hour", "person-day", etc., for political correctness and simple fact.

== Productive system hours ==
The concept of productive system hours (PSH) has been used in forestry in Austria and by extension to other work. It includes time for breaks and can be used to calculate how long it may take to complete a task, including required recovery times from physically strenuous work, as well as legally required breaks or other human interactions. If it includes 15-minute breaks, it is written as (PSH15).

A related concept is productive machine hours (PMH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wabo.boku.ac.at/uploads/media/raupe_pnw99_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102011213/http://www.wabo.boku.ac.at/uploads/media/raupe_pnw99_e.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}  More details in the paper "Influence of Terrain Conditions and Thinning Regimes on Productivity of a Track-Based Steep Slope Harvester".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Money''' is a [[personal finance]] management tool for [[macOS|Mac OS X]] by Jumsoft. The latest major release, version 3.0, was released in 2008. Money is designed for [[accounting]] and [[budget]]ing as well as for creating [[inventory]] lists and [[invoice]]s, and is primarily marketed to [[small business]] and home users. The application is also used for [[investment management]], as it offers a Portfolio feature displaying [[share (finance)|share]] information, security quote history, [[stock market index|market indices]], and the market value of a user’s share [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. Money does not support the traditional [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry accounting]] and is based on separate cash, bank, investment, and other accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jumsoft.com/money/ Money official site], visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Money is a part of Jumsoft’s Home Business Trio bundle of business management applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jumsoft.com/businesstrio/ Home Business Trio description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528151851/http://www.jumsoft.com/businesstrio/ |date=2010-05-28 }}, visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Versions for [[iPhone]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyappshow.com/jumsoft-releases-money-1-0-for-iphone-small-business-accounting Jumsoft Releases Money 1.0 for iPhone], visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iPad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/150777/2010/04/jumsoft_ipad.html Jumsoft Money updated with iPad compatibility]&lt;/ref&gt; are available for free at [[iTunes Store]].

==History==
The first version of Money was released in 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/21766&amp;vid=125536&amp;mode=info Money 1.0 release notes on Version Tracker]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and contained very basic tools for entering [[financial transaction]]s and performing analysis. It was designed for [[Mac OS X 10.2]] and [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3]], and was mainly intended for the [[United States|U.S.]] market. In 2006, Money 2 [[beta version|Beta]] was launched, featuring a substantially expanded range of functions. The new version introduced budgeting, visual reports, scheduled transactions and transfers among accounts, as well as multiple [[currency|currencies]]. Less than a month after the beta version appeared, Jumsoft released a stable version 2.0. Version 3.0 was launched in 2008 and added budget and investment portfolio monitoring, inventories, and invoices to the list of features.

'''New Europe Market (NEM)''' is an annual marketing conference, market and screenings event held in Dubrovnik, and run by the Croatian company Mediavision Ltd.&lt;ref name="new-market-for-cee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltveurope.net/29027/new-market-for-cee|title=New market for CEE|publisher=digitaltveurope.net|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focal idea behind the event is the creation of a platform where media, telecommunications and marketing professionals can share their knowledge and experience during the conference and networking events. The conference is addressed to [[Free-to-air|FTAs]], [[Pay television|Pay-TV channels]], [[Cable television|cable operators]], [[Satellite television|satellite operators]], [[IPTV]], [[Production company|production]] and [[Film distribution|distribution]] companies, [[Media agency|media]] and [[Advertising agency|marketing]] agencies and specialists. NEM focuses on the [[Central and Eastern Europe|CEE region]], but the event attendees come from all over the world,.&lt;ref name="neweuropemarket"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://neweumarket.com/about-nem/|title= About – New Europe Market|publisher=neweumarket.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{external media | width = 210px | headerimage=[[File:Ivo_Josipovi%C4%87_election_2009-2010_left.jpg|210px]] | float = right

The first New Europe Market was a four-day event held in May 2013 in Dubrovnik and gathered representatives from 250 companies. The event was held under the auspices of the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic of Croatia]], [[Ivo Josipović]],.&lt;ref name="ivo-josipovic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/international-tv-execs-attend-new-519440|title=International TV Execs Attend New Europe Market Launch, Discuss Boosting Business|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics of discussion ranged from “Sport migration from Public to Pay TV” to “Channel Distribution”.

In 2014 New Europe Market included, for the first time, screenings and production workshops. During the conference [[HBO Europe|HBO Adria]] revealed a replica of [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Iron Throne]], from [[Game of Thrones]], which was a very popular tourist attraction in Dubrovnik, where  Game Of Thrones was partly filmed,.&lt;ref name="nem-iron-throne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubrovacki.hr/clanak/63796/game-of-thrones-iron-throne-in-dubrovnik|title=Game of Thrones Iron Throne in Dubrovnik|publisher=dubrovacki.hr|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nem-hbo-sungarden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/hotel/20513-sun-gardens-dubrovnik-hosts-hbo-and-the-food-network-at-this-year-s-nem-conference|title=Chris Dziadul Reports: NEM 2015 review|publisher=incentivetravel.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions during the NEM concerned topics like trends in global promotion of local content or developments of cloud technology&lt;ref name=videoage&gt;{{cite news|title=Underpenetrated Region Offers Opportunities For Indie Cinema|url=http://www.videoageinternational.com/pdfUploads/issuearchives/2014/2014_34_03.pdf|accessdate=2015-11-10|work=Videoage|page=30|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th edition of NEM brought together more than 300 companies and 1000+ participants from all over the world that took part in 10 panel discussions, two presentations and countless networking opportunities. NEM 2016 was marked by the global premiere of the series ''The Paper'', keynote speech from Christoph Mainusch, co-CEO of Central European Media Enterprises and executive director and &amp; CEO of Nova Group, Vice`s announcement of expansion in the region, Podravka`s presentation of its new series ''Croatia’s Finest'' with MasterChef winner Dhruv Baker as well as the released information about a new partnership Ginx has finalized with Sky and ITV involving the launch of the first UK 24-hour eSport Channel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formatbiz.it/post.php?id=2806&lt;/ref&gt;

NEM staff includes 12 young people (changing every year), students of journalism, media, production etc., who gain knowledge and experience from working in their related branches.  In this way NEM strengthens ties and connections between academic and business sectors whilst also developing new ideas and standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15784">'''Organizational ethics''' is the [[ethics]] of an [[organization]], and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external stimulus. Organizational ethics is interdependent with the [[organizational culture]]. Although it is akin to both '''[[organizational behavior]]''' (OB) and [[industrial and organizational psychology]] as well as '''[[business ethics]]''' on the micro and macro levels, organizational ethics is neither OB or I/O psychology, nor is it solely business ethics (which includes corporate governance and [[corporate ethics]]). Organizational ethics express the values of an organization to its employees and/or other entities irrespective of governmental and/or regulatory laws.

Ethics are the principles and values used by an individual to govern his or her actions and decisions.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship.org"&gt;Matthews, J. (n.d.). Eight Elements of an Ethical Organization. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://www.entrepreneurship.org/resource-center/eight-elements-of-an-ethical-organization.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; An organization forms when individuals with varied interests and different backgrounds unite on a common platform and work together towards predefined goals and objectives.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship.org"/&gt; A code of ethics within an organization is a set of principles that is used to guide the organization in its decisions, programs, and policies.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"&gt;Kelchner, L. (n.d.). The Importance of Ethics in Organizations. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-ethics-organizations-20925.html&lt;/ref&gt; An ethical organizational culture consists of leaders and employees adhering to a code of ethics.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"/&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Business ethics.jpg|thumb]]
An organization's ethical philosophy can affect the organization in many ways including its reputation, productivity, and the bottom line of the organization.&lt;ref name="smallbusiness.chron.com"/&gt; Ethics within an organization can offer many benefits. A positive ethical corporate culture improves the morale among the workers in an organization, which could increase productivity and employee retention.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} More productivity improves the efficiency of the organizations and increased employee retention reduces the cost of replacing employees.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) restricts the United States business firms from engaging in bribery and other illegal practices internationally. There are laws that have the same type of prohibition for European companies which create a disadvantage competitively for both European and U.S. firms.&lt;ref name="qje"&gt;Svensson, Jakob, “Who Must Pay Bribes and How Much? Evidence from a Cross-Section of Firms,” ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 118(2003), page 207&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws are not a restricting element to organizations that have highly elevated ethical behavior as part of their values. Organizations that lack ethical practices as a mandatory basis of their business structure and corporate culture, have commonly been found to fail due to the absence of business ethics. Corporate downfalls would include, but are not limited to, the recent [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]] scandals, two primary examples of unethical business practices concerning questionable accounting transactions. 

Organizations focusing on encouraging ethical practices are commonly viewed with respect by their employees, the community, and corresponding industries.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Managing with Soul: Combining Corporate Integrity with the Bottom Line,” November 14, 2003, www.hreonline.com/HRE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical business practices of organizations have resulted in a solid financial bottom-line. This has been seen through greater sales and increased revenue by companies retaining talented personnel and attracting new skilled employees. More importantly, an ethical organization will have the ability to retain employees that are experienced and knowledgeable (generally referred to as [[human capital]]).  This human capital results in less employee turnover, less training time for new employees, and greater output regarding [[Service (economics)|services]] (or production of [[good (economics)|goods]]).

==Basic ethical elements==

There are at least four elements that aim to create an ethical culture and behavior of employees within an organization. These elements are: 
# a written code of ethics and standards ([[ethical code]])
# ethics [[training]] for executives, managers, and employees
# the availability of ethical situational advice (i.e. advice lines or offices)
# confidential reporting systems&lt;ref name="hrm"&gt;Clark, Margaret M., JD., SPHR, "Corporate Ethics Programs Make a Difference, but not the only difference", ''HR Magazine'', July 1, 2003, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations are constantly striving for a better ethical atmosphere within the business climate and culture. Businesses must create an ethical business climate in order to develop an ethical organization. Otherwise said, companies must focus on the ethics of employees in order to create an ethical business. Employees must know the difference between what is acceptable and unacceptable in the workplace. These standards are found in the written code of ethics or may be referred to as the [[employee handbook]]. These standards are a written form of employee conduct and performance expectations.

Employee handbooks also commonly include rules concerning expectations and consequences that follow misconduct. Handbooks normally will clearly state the rules, guidelines, and standards of an organization as well as possible rules, regulations, and laws that they are bound by. Many company handbooks will include laws regarding [[sexual harassment]], [[alcohol abuse]], and [[substance abuse|drug/substance abuse]].
&lt;br&gt;For more information regarding situational ethical principles, refer to "[[Situational ethics#Situational ethics outlined|Situational Ethics]]."

==Intrinsic and extrinsic organizational rewards==
The [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] rewards of an ethical organization are bound to an organization's culture and ethics. Based on the reliability and support structure of each of the four areas needed for ethical behavior, the organizational ethics will be evident throughout the organization. The organization including the employees, managers, suppliers, customers, and other entities, will receive '''intrinsic and extrinsic rewards'''. Actions of employees can range from [[whistleblower|whistle blowing]] (intrinsic) to the extraordinary actions of hourly employee purchasing all the recently produced peanut butter (as produced by his [[employer]]), that has no resale value due to mislabeled jars. This employee was aware that his employer (extrinsic) would reimburse him in full for purchasing the mislabeled peanut butter.&lt;ref name="pfe"&gt;Peters, T.J., and Austin, N. ,(1985), Passion for Excellence: The Leadership difference. New York: Ballantine.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For more information regarding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, see "[[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation]]."

==Ethical theory and leadership empowerment==
There are many theories and [[organizational studies]] that are related to “organizational ethics,” but "[[organization]]s" and "ethics" are wide and varied in application and scope. These theories and studies can range from [[individual]](s), [[team]](s), [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]], [[management]], [[leadership]], [[human resources]], [[Group (sociology)|group]](s) interaction(s), as well as the [[psychological]] framework behind each area to include the distribution of [[job (role)|job]] tasks within various types of organizations. As among these areas, the influence of '''leadership''' in any organization cannot go unexamined, because of a clear understanding of the [[Wikibooks:Development Cooperation Handbook/The development aid organization/The Organization’s Vision|organization’s vision]], goals (to include immediate and long-term strategic plans), and values. Leadership sets the tone for organizational management (strategic actions taken by an organization to create a positive image to both internal and external public). In turn, leadership directly influences the organizational symbolism (which reflects the culture, the language of the members, any meaningful objects, representations, and/or how someone may act or think within an organization). The values and ideals within an organization generally center upon “values for business” as the theoretical approach most leaders use to present to their "co-members" (which in truth maybe subordinates).
&lt;br&gt;In fact, an examination of business reveals that most leaders approach the X(?) from the perspective of values for the business.&lt;ref name="DH1"&gt;Dricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael (2002). Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven Management&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McD"&gt;McDaniel, Charlotte, (2004), Organizational Ethics: Research and Ethical Environments, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside presenting the vision, values, and goals of the organization, the leader should infuse [[empowerment]] and [[motivation]] to its members. Leaders using '''empowerment''' to motivate their subordinates, is based upon the view of: “Achieving organizational ownership of company values is a continuous process of communication, discussion, and debate throughout all areas of the organization”&lt;ref name="DH2"&gt;Dricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael, (2002), Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven Management, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; as.
&lt;br&gt;For more information about organization theory, refer to "[[Organizational theory|Organizational Theory]]."

==Stakeholder theory==
Whether it is a team, small group, or a large international entity, the ability for any organization to reason, act rationally, and respond ethically is paramount. Leaders must have the ability to recognize the needs and desires of members (or called “'''stakeholders'''” in some theories or models), and how they correspond to the organization. It is the [[stakeholder theory]] that implies that all '''stakeholders''' (or individuals) must be treated equally, regardless of the fact that some individuals will contribute more than others to the organization.&lt;ref name="DAG"&gt;D.A. Gioia, (1999), "Practicability, Paradigms, and Problems in Stakeholder Theorizing," Academy of Management Review, 24(2), pp. 228–232.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Leaders who motivate others must present the goals of an organization to the stakeholders with respect to particular benefits of the stakeholders. Leaders must set aside individual (or personal) ambitions (along with any prejudice) in order to present these goals properly. Furthermore, it is leadership that influences '''stakeholders''' towards ethical behavior for the organization. They must step behind a [[veil of ignorance]] and treat every stakeholder as a means with equal weight. Importantly, the leader (or [[stakeholder management]]) must possess the necessary skills and rank to ensure that each stakeholders voice is respected and heard within the organization to ensure that other voices are not expressing views (or needs as in respects to [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]). Therefore, stakeholder management must ensure an ethical system for their own management styles, personalities, systems, performances, plans, policies, strategies, productivity, [[openness]], and even risk(s) within their cultures or industries.

==Ethical system implementation==
The function of developing and implementing business ethics into an organization is difficult. Due to each organization's culture and atmosphere being different, there is no clear or specific way to implement a code of ethics to an existing business. Business ethics implementation can be categorized into two groups; formal and informal measures. Formal measures include training and courses pertaining to ethics. Informal measures are led by example from either the manager or the social norm of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belak |first=Jernej|date=2011|title=Informal and Formal Institutional Measures of Business Ethics Implementation at Different Stages of Enterprise Life Cycle |url=http://uni-obuda.hu/journal/Belak_Milfelner_27.pdf |journal=Acta Polytechnica Hungarica |volume=8 |number=1 |pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several steps to follow when trying to implement an ethical system. Some of these steps include obtaining a commitment from the board of directors and senior managers, developing resources for ethics initiatives, and determining ethical risks and developing contingency plans. Other steps include developing an ethics program that addresses risks while still maintaining compliance with the ethical standards, providing insight for implementation and audits of the ethical programs, and communicating with stakeholders to create shared commitment and values for ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|publisher=South Western College |year=1990 |isbn=9781111825164|location=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation should be performed to the entirety of the business including all areas of operations. If it is not implemented pragmatically and with caution for the needs, desires, and personalities (consider the [[Big Five personality traits]]) of the stakeholders, the culture, and the employees, then problems may arise. Although a great deal of time may be required, stakeholder management should consider the [[Rational Decision-Making Model]] for implementation of various aspects, details, and standards of an ethical system to the stakeholders. If an implementation has been performed successfully, then all stakeholders have accepted the newly designed ethics system for the organization.With the implementation of an ethical system comes the implementation of new tasks and responsibilities. The responsibilities include leadership in ethics, delegating, and communicating as well as motivating the company’s ethical position to its employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy |first=Patrick |date=1998 |title=Implementing Business Ethics |hdl=10822/827633 |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=7 |pages=907-915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organising''' is a systematic process of structuring, integrating, co-ordinating task goals, and activities to resources in order to attain objectives.

==History==
The [[information organization|organizing of information]] could be seen since humans began to [[write]]. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history, but also supports the communication of history. Recording ideas in a written text, as opposed to verbally communicating with someone, and more specifically cataloging ideas and thoughts, is also an attempt to organize information.

[[Science book]]s are notable by their organization of a specific subject.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Encyclopedia]]s usually organize subjects into a single place, for faster [[index (publishing)|indexing]] and seeking of meanings.

== Characteristics ==
The following are the important characteristics of organization.

*'''Specialization and division of work.''' The entire philosophy of organization is centered on the concepts of [[specialization of work|specialization]] and [[division of work]]. The division of work is assigning responsibility for each organizational component to a specific individual or group thereof. It becomes specialization when the responsibility for a specific task lies with a designated expert in that field. The efforts of the operatives are coordinated to allow the process at hand to function correctly. Certain operatives occupy positions of [[management]] at various points in the process to ensure coordination.
*'''Orientation towards goals.''' Every organization has its own purposes and objectives. Organizing is the function employed to achieve the overall goals of the organization. Organization harmonizes the individual goals of the employees with overall objectives of the firm.
*'''Composition of individuals and groups.''' Individuals form a group and the groups form an organization. Thus, organization is the composition of individual and groups. Individuals are grouped into departments and their work is coordinated and directed towards organizational goals.
*'''Continuity.''' An organization is a group of people with a defined relationship in which they work together to achieve the goals of that organization. This relationship does not come to end after completing each task. Organization is a never ending process.
*'"FLEXIBILITY.'" The organising process should be flexible so that any change can be incorporated. It ensures the ability to adapt and adjust the activities in response to the change taking place in the external environment. The programmes, policies and strategies can be changed as and when required if the provision for flexibility is made in the organising process.

== Purpose ==

*'''Helps to achieve organizational goal.''' Organization is employed to achieve the overall objectives of business firms. Organization focuses attention of individuals objectives towards overall objectives.
*'''Optimum use of resources.''' To make optimum use of resources such as men, material, money, machine and method, it is necessary to design an organization properly. Work should be divided and right people should be given right jobs to reduce the wastage of resources in an organization.
*'''To perform managerial function.''' Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing and Controlling cannot be implemented without proper organization.
*'''Facilitates growth and diversification.''' A good organization structure is essential for expanding business activity. Organization structure determines the input resources needed for expansion of a business activity similarly organization is essential for product diversification such as establishing a new product line. it also stimulates creativity in managers by organizing.
*'''Humane treatment of employees.''' Organization has to operate for the betterment of employees and must not encourage monotony of work due to higher degree of specialization. Now, organization has adapted the modern concept of systems approach based on human relations and it discards the traditional productivity and specialization approach.

==Applications==
'''Organizing''', in [[company|companies]] point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals.

===Structure===

The framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.

#A set of formal tasks assigned to individuals and departments.
#Formal reporting relationships, including lines of authority, decision responsibility, number of hierarchical levels and span of managers control.
#The design of systems to ensure effective coordination of employees across departments.

=== Work specialization===

Work specialization (also called [[division of labour]] or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.

===Chain of command===
[[Command hierarchy|Chain of command]] is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction.  Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.
Chain of command(also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.

===Authority, responsibility, and accountability===

*'''Authority''' is a manager's formal and legitimate right to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organizationally desired outcomes.
*'''Responsibility''' means an employee's duty to perform assigned task or activities.
*'''Accountability''' means that those with authority and responsibility must report and justify task outcomes to those above them in the chain of command.

===Delegation===

Delegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers’ needs and adapt to competitive environments.
Possible reasons for delegation:
1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few
2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified
3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience

===Types of authority (and responsibility)===

'''Line authority''' managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.

'''Functional authority''' is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is "advice" rather than "order".

'''Staff authority''' is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises,  recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with [[management]].  It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.

''' Line and Staff Authority''' is the combination of Line organization and Staff organization.  Such organization follows both the principles of scalar chain of command and there is a provision for specialized activities  to be performed by staff officers who act in an advisory capacity

===Span of management===
Categories:
*Direct single relationship.
*Direct group relationships.
*Cross relationship.
Factors influencing larger span of management.
#Work performed by subordinates is stable and routine.
#Subordinates perform similar work tasks.
#Subordinates are concentrated in a single location.
#Subordinates are highly trained and need little direction in performing tasks.
#Rules and procedures defining task activities are available.
#Support systems and personnel are available for the managers.
#Little time is required in non-supervisory activities such as coordination with other departments or planning.
#Managers' personal preferences and styles favor a large span.

===Tall versus flat structure===

*'''Tall''' - A management structure characterized by an overall narrow span of management and a relatively large number of hierarchical levels. Tight control. [[Hierarchical organization|Reduced communication overhead]].
*'''Flat''' - A management structure characterized by a wide span of control and relatively few hierarchical levels. Loose control. Facilitates delegation.

===Centralization, decentralization, and formalization===

*'''Centralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near top organizational levels.
*'''Decentralization''' - The location of decision-making authority near lower organizational levels.
*'''Formalization''' - The written documentation used to direct and control employees.

===Departmentalization===

[[Departmentalization]] is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:
#'''Functional''' - by common skills and work task
#'''Divisional''' - common product, program or geographical location
#'''Matrix'''     - combination of Functional and Divisional
#'''Team'''       - to accomplish specific tasks
#'''Network'''    - departments are independent providing functions for a central core breaker

===Importance of organizing===

*Organizations are often troubled by how to organize, particularly when a new strategy is developed
*Changing market conditions or new technology requires change
*Organizations seek efficiencies through improvements in organizing

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to marketing:

'''[[Marketing]]''' &amp;ndash; social and managerial processes by which products, services, and value are exchanged in order to fulfill individuals' or groups' needs and wants. These processes include, but are not limited to, [[advertising]], [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[product management]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Core concepts in marketing==
Marketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); [[Company|commercial organisations]] (known as [[Business-to-business|business to business marketing or B2B]]), [[Business-to-government|to government]]; to not-for-profit organisations ([[Nonprofit organization|Not-for-profit orgnanization (NFP)]]) or some combination of any of these.

===Actors and relationships===

: At the centre of the marketing framework is the [[consumer]] lies the relationship between the '''consumer''' and the '''organisation''' with the implication that marketers must manage the way the organisation presents its public face.

:: '''The [[consumer]]:''' Typically, the consumer refers to the [[end-user]] - but this may be an individual or group such as a [[household]], [[family]] unit or [[organisation]]. In addition, marketers may need to consider the roles of [[Influencer marketing|influencers]] such as [[Opinion leadership|Opinion leader]]s who increasingly use means such as [[social media]] to develop [[customer to customer]] networks of influence.

:: '''The organisation:''' may be represented by many different actors including: various ''sales personnel'': [[Law of agency|Agent]]; [[Broker]]; [[Sales|Sales representative]]; [[Merchant]]; [[Retail]]er; [[Street vendor]] or [[Vendor]]

:''Selling situations &amp; relationships'': Depending on the nature of the business operations, many different types of actors are involved in a variety of selling situations involving a variety of sales personnel, who perform varied sales roles. Sales activities involve many different types of customer relationships - from simple [[Financial transaction|transactional exchange]] through to long-term, enduring [[Customer relationship management|customer relationships]].

===Needs, wants and demands===

Marketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants. 
: A [[need]] is something required for a healthy life (e.g. food, water, shelter); A [[want]] is a desire, wish or aspiration; When needs or wants are backed by [[purchasing power]], they have the potential to become [[demand]]s.

===Nature of exchange===
[[Exchange (economics)|Exchange]], the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves [[Financial transaction]]s, but may also involve [[barter]], contra dealing or other form of [[trade]]. The object of exchange can include: [[Goods]]; [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Experiential marketing|experiences]]; [[concept]]s or [[idea]]s; [[Cause marketing|causes]] and may even involve [[Celebrity branding|celebrity marketing]]

===Perceptions of value===
{{See|Customer value proposition}}
: Traditional thinking around the concept of [[Value (marketing)|value]] was that marketers created value through [[innovation]], [[product design]] and manufacture and that [[Utility]] was embedded in products or services offered for sale. In this type of thinking, marketer's objective was to communicate a [[value proposition]] to potential buyers. However, [[Service-dominant logic|recent thinking]] has changed the traditional perspective and now recognises that consumers may participate in the [[Co-creation|co-creation of value]] in a variety of ways. Consumers may derive value through usage and experience, known as [[value-in-use]] or may be involved in product design, known as [[participatory design]].

==Foundation economic concepts==
Given that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories.

;Competitive advantages &amp; comparative advantages
Businesses seek to compete by achieving [[competitive advantage]]s or [[comparative advantage]]s. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: [[Economies of scope]]; [[Economies of scale]]; [[Experience curve effects|Experience effects]]; [[First-mover advantage]]s. Alternatively a business may seek to develop develop uniqueness through [[product differentiation]] or developing unique [[Core competency|competencies]] such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior [[Value (economics)|customer value]].
superior value.

;Competition:types
Different types of competitive markets can be identified: [[Duopoly]]; [[Monopoly]]; [[Monopolistic competition]]; [[Imperfect competition]]; [[Oligopoly]]

;Demand
Understanding [[Supply and demand|demand and supply]] is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function.

: The basic ''mechanics'' of [[Demand|consumer demand]] include:  [[Demand curve]]; [[Demand-led growth]]; [[Demand response]]; [[Law of demand]]; [[Law of supply]]; [[Transaction costs]].
: Different ''types of demand'' functions include: [[Derived demand]]; [[Inverse demand function]].

;Economic systems
In Western economies, the [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as [[barter]] economies and the [[Sharing economy]] can be identified.

;Markets
*[[Market (economics)|Market]]
*[[Monopsony]]
*[[Oligopsony]]

;Value
Value-in-ownership
[[Value-in-use]]

==Planning levels and planning tools ==

===Planning levels ===

Marketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. [[Marketing plan]]s must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or [[business plan]]. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals.

: [[Strategic planning]] is fundamentally concerned with the policies that will improve the firm's [[Competitive advantage|competitive position]]. Strategic planning is sometimes called higher-order planning and is usually long-term planning (say 3–7 years) while management planning is short-term and may be carried out for a specific program (e.g. a sales or advertising campaign of a few weeks duration) or carried out annually. Strategic plans typically include a statement of the firm's [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. The [[Marketing strategy]] is a plan that shows how the firm's marketing activities will help to achieve the overall strategic goals.

: [[Marketing management]] is focused on developing the marketing program or [[Marketing mix]] (also known as the ''4Ps'') and is concerned with the implementation of specific action plans designed to achieve objective, measurable targets ([[SMART criteria|SMART objectives]]). Marketing management plans are typically prepared on an annual planning cycle, but may be prepared for shorter periods for special events such as a product launch, a new logo, change to corporate livery or a repositioning campaign.

===Strategic planning tools and techniques===

Strategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed.

====Strategic research methods====
Strategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional [[market research]] methods. Instead, they use methods such as: [[Environmental scanning]];&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, L., King, W. R. and Narayanan, V. K., "Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—The state of the art," ''Long Range Planning,'' Vol. 14, No. 1, 1981, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing intelligence]] (also known as [[competitive intelligence]])&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, C. and Bensoussan, B.

F. and Narver, J. C., "Intelligence Generation and Superior Customer Value," ''Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, pp. 120–128&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Futures studies|Futures research]]&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, F. and Hertin, J., "Foresight futures scenarios: developing and applying a participative strategic planning tool," ''Greener Management International,'' Spring 2002, pp. 37+; Skumanich, M. and Silbernagel, M., “Background on Foresighting Methods,” Ch. 2 in ''Foresighting Around the World,'' Battelle Seattle Research Centre, 1997, e-text, www.seattle.battelle.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strategic analysis methods====

Marketers draw on a very wide variety of techniques and tools when analysing the market and the broader operating conditions. The technique selected depends on the nature of the situation or problem to be investigated and the analyst's skill and experience. Strategic analysts employ some 200 different quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques including:&lt;ref&gt;Fleitcher, C. and Bensoussan, B., ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition,'' Prentice Hall, NJ  Prentice Hall, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

If necessary, corrective action can be taken to get back on track.

== Branches of Marketing ==

The book titled, ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016 edited by Michael J. Baker and Susan Hart identifies the distinct branches of marketing practice as:

* Consumer marketing (general [[Marketing]])
* [[Business marketing]]; also known as [[Business-to-business]] marketing and [[Industrial marketing]] (which also includes [[Business-to-government|Business-to-government marketing]])
* Relationship marketing
* [[Environmental marketing]]; also known as [[Green marketing]] )
* [[International marketing]]; also known as [[Global marketing]])
* [[Services marketing]]; which includes not-for-profit marketing and [[Destination marketing]]) 
* [[Retail]]ing 
* [[Social marketing]] (which includes  [[Cause-related marketing]])

For a more detailed breakdown of the relevant topics for each of these key branches of marketing, see [[Outline of marketing#Branches of Marketing: Detailed topics|Branches of Marketing: Detailed Topics]] on this page. For special applications of marketing including marketing of specific types of products (e.g. agricultural marketing, faith based marketing, pharmaceutical marketing, political marketing, sports marketing, etc.,) or marketing to specific target groups (e.g. marketing to children, marketing to older people, LBGT marketing) see: [[Outline of marketing#Special applications of marketing and promotion|Special applications of marketing practice]]).

Marketing orientations are the philosophies or mindsets that guide and shape marketing planning and marketing practice. Some marketing historians believe that different [[History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice|philosophies have informed marketing practice]] at different times in marketing's history.

===New product development (NPD)===
{{main|New product development}}

[[Innovation]] and [[New product development]] are an important part of a firm's long term growth strategy.

The steps in a basic new production development process are:

:[[Creativity|Idea generation]] (or [[Ideation (creative process)]]) →Concept screening→ [[Concept testing]] → [[Business analysis]] → [[Design|Product development]] → [[Test market|Market testing]] → [[Commercialization]] and may include a [[Soft launch]]

The NPD process can be applied to:

:Products: [[New product development]]; [[Design]]
:Services: [[Service innovation]]; [[Service design]] 
:Environmental goods or services: [[Eco-innovation]]; [[Ecodesign]]; [[Lean product development]]

A recent trend in NPD is the use of [[participatory design]], also known as co-design or co-operative design, which involves stakeholders such as employees or consumers in the design process.

Sources of new product ideas include: [[Research and development]]; [[User innovation|Consumers or Users]]; distributors, suppliers or [[crowdsourcing]].

'''Types of innovation'''
*[[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
*[[Disruptive innovation]]

NPD represents a high risk activity. It requires substantial investment and a [[list of product failures]] suggests that the probability of failure is relatively high.

'''New product adoption and diffusion'''

In order to develop a superior understanding of how new products are adopted by the market place and the factors that influence adoption rates, marketers often turn to a number of models or theories of the adoption/diffusion process:

*[[Bass diffusion model]]
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] (article)
*[[Diffusion of innovations]] (article) 
**[[Early adopter]] 
**[[Hype cycle]]
*[[Technology acceptance model]] (article)
*[[Technology adoption life cycle]] (article)
*[[Technology life cycle]]
*[[Quality function deployment]]
*''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'' (Book title)

===Legal protection of new products and brands===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''professional conference organiser''', '''professional congress organiser''' ('''PCO''') or '''conference company''' is a company which specialises in the organisation and management of congresses, conferences, seminars and similar events.

==Role==
PCOs can typically work as consultants for academic and professional associations. They usually provide full service management for conferences including conference design, [[abstract_management|abstract management software]], program development, registration, site and venue selection and booking, audiovisuals, IT support, logistics, leisure management, marketing, printing and web services, sourcing speakers, funding,  sponsorship and exhibitor sales, financial management and budget control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKDnKFv3v0YC&amp;pg=PT322&amp;lpg=PT322&amp;dq=pco+conferences&amp;source=web&amp;ots=44eHJG8Ei5&amp;sig=ZQTKIwLhEwzOlMiEjG8Fx2b0y-4#PPT321,M1 Conferences and Conventions: A Global Industry By Tony Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies offer related services including travel agents and public relations companies. They tend to focus on limited areas such as destination management.

==Size of market sector==
Recent surveys of UK conference venues have found that a third of conference bookings were made by PCOs or venue-finding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC Information drawn from the British Conference Venues Survey 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100649/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf Survey of Conferences in Scotland in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070507/http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html Paid report in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (first part free)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207013830/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 UK-based conferences generated £7.6 billion in direct sales giving PCOs a central role in some £2.5 billion of revenue generation. The UK is ranked second behind the US for global market share of conferences. Thus, although there is no one source of global statistics for the conference market it appears that PCOs play a central role in several billion dollars' worth of revenue generation worldwide.

'''Small and medium enterprises in Mexico''' generally called PYMEs ({{lang-es|pequeña y mediana empresa}}), are an important segment of the [[Economy of Mexico|Mexican economy]]. They are classified in two types of [[small and medium enterprises]]: family businesses and non-family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicoemprende.org.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=67|title= PyMEs |author= Mexico Emprende | year=2009|publisher=Mexico Emprende|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Government]] supports PyMEs since 2004. The Mexican Chamber of Economy with the help of the Mexican government creates different type of programs for the PyMEs that need to improve their participation in the national market and also for the international market. The PyMEs' size is classified by the number of employees they have. The main sectors are manufacturing, commerce and service.

== PyMEs in Mexico ==
As of 2006 there were about 4 million enterprises in Mexico. Out of those 4 million, 99.8% were small and medium enterprises. About 52% of the Mexican [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] is generated by small and medium size enterprises. While the remaining 48% relies on large enterprises. Small and medium size enterprises contribute with the 72% of the formal employment in Mexico. PyMEs are subdivided into: 15% for Micro, 14.5% for small and 22.5% for medium enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date=  |publisher=Government |location= Mexico|language= Spanish |trans-title=national week of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico |accessdate=&lt;!-- (date you last opened the site) --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PyMes can be classified by type and size. There is a manufacturing, commerce, and service type. Within these, PyMEs are classified according to the number of employees—10, 50, 250 and more than 250 respectively—into micro, small, medium, and large enterprises. Service enterprises are classed by those with have 10, 50, 100, and more than 100 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date=  |publisher= |location=&lt;!-- (of publish, if any) --&gt; |language=Spanish |trans-title=national week for small and medium size enterprises |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PyMEs throughout the nation are distributed by region. About 38% of them in the central part of the country, 17% locate southwest, 6% southeast, 12% northeast and 27% center-west.

There are two types of PyMEs in [[Mexico]] (according to their origin). Those that began as family businesses and those formed by more formal partnership. The ones that start as family business are small and only very few of them have some type of projection abroad. These are usually the ones who search for government support mainly for financial and training purposes. The other type of small and Medium size enterprises in Mexico are those who follow an established path. An example of this could be franchises, these do not have a problem of expanding abroad. Franchises are small projection of big enterprises who have already done the market research before entering a new zone. They have all the possible experience on expanding overseas and very little risk on failing because in most cases they go under the concept of a high brand awareness.

PyMEs have been an important part of the country's development, especially in the area of exports. Due to their small size they are versatile, dynamic and have growth potential. This potential also includes entering international markets. They are a major source of job creation in the country and are the most likely to implement new technologies. Since many are located in different regions of the country, they foment local development. The main contribution to enterprises growth lies on PyMEs. The importance of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico has grown through time due to the positive effect these businesses have had on Mexico's economy. Since these enterprises continue becoming more important, government is focusing a lot on supporting them.

On the other hand, they also have some disadvantages. In general PyMEs have not development the habit of reinvesting to improve production or reinvest in equipment. They do not have enough economic resources to hire specialized employees nor to train current ones. This and lack of foresight can lead to insufficient sales, lack of competitiveness, inadequate customer service, low quality and higher prices. Because of the lack of quality control, legal problems such as dealing with VATs and defective products becomes an issue.&lt;ref name="Que son las PyMEs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicoemprende.org.mx |title=que son las PyMEs? |author= |date=  |publisher=Mexican government |location=&lt;!-- (of publish, if any) --&gt; |language=Spanish |trans-title=|accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs for PyME developments ==
Since 2004, Mexican government has had a number of programs to support PyMEs so that they help Mexico's economy growth. The government has two groups of programs to support PyMEs.The first group helps PyMEs to grow within the national market. The main programs are Emerging Programs, Productive Projects, Centros Mexico Emprende (Mexico undertake program), National System of Loan Guaranties, and Enterprises Consultancy.&lt;ref name="Apoyo PyMEs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/segmento.asp?Tema=3|title= Fondo de Apoyo para la Micro Pequeña y Mediana Empresa|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Support Fund for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises |accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of the ''Programas Emergentes'' (Emerging Programs) is to help the economic areas that have been affected by natural disasters. This program achieves this objective through loans with special payment conditions. This help is given to the PyMEs that stop their economic activity because of a natural disaster. The Emerging Programs are coordinated and supervised by "Fondo PyMe." The regulations that this organization point out is that the PyMEs are supported with special resources with the concepts that the directive council determine that are essential to the economic reactivation of the enterprises. These enterprises have to satisfy certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Programas Emergentes"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=9|title= Programas Emergentes|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Emerging Programs|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Proyectos Productivos'' (Productive Projects) helps to finance investment projects that improve the competitiveness of PyMes. This helps to trigger the creation and maintenance of jobs and regional development. The most important project is the financing. These funds are mostly targeted to production projects. The projects have to help by developing, expansion and consolidation of the enterprises.&lt;ref name="Proyectos Productivos"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=12|title= Proyectos Productivos|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Productive Projects|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Centros Mexico Emprende'' (Mexico undertake program) is for the execution of public or private services to support PyMEs. The support is given in a comprehensive, accessible, lively, and timely way according to the size and the enterprises potential. The different types of center concepts are: fitting out and infrastructure, designing and updating information systems for planning, and measuring of results generated from the "Centros Mexico Emprende."&lt;ref name="Centros Mexico Emprende"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=15|title= Centros Mexico Emprende|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Mexico undertake project|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sistema Nacional de Garantias'' (National System of Loan Guaranties) provides PyMEs with easy access to the financing programs with competitive conditions and payment periods.&lt;ref name="Sistema Nacional de Garantias"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=8|title= Sistema Nacional de Garantias|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=National System of Guaranties|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Consultoria Empresarial'' (Enterprises Consultancy) is a program that helps PyMEs be more productive and profitable. It achieves this objective through the identification of business intervention programs. These programs are applied to one or more fundamental areas of an enterprise as training and consultancy and the development of instructors and consultants.&lt;ref name="Consultoria Empresarial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondopyme.gob.mx/2010/descripcion.asp?Cat_Id=3&amp;prog=22|title= Consultoria Empresarial|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Enterprises Consultancy|accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs for existing PyMEs and international expansion ==
The second group helps PyMEs to maintain a place and to succeed in the international market. The SPyME (Subsecretaría para la Pequeña y Mediana Empresa) was created to promote, encourage, and design tools and programs with the purpose of creating, consolidating and developing micro, small, and medium enterprises in the international market.&lt;ref name="Economia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_Contacto_PyME|title=Contacto PyME|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|accessdate=October 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021111311/http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_Contacto_PyME|archivedate=October 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sub-secretary for Small and Medium Enterprise (SPYME), with the purpose of helping primarily small enterprises, created the ''Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consultoría'' (National Program for Training and Consultancy). This program incorporates improvement actions in areas where weaknesses or opportunities are detected. The program stimulates the consolidation of the entrepreneurship through actions like the instrumentation of innovative methodologies in productive priority sectors. The program also foments the application of strategic programs to improve enterprises management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=catalogo Mexicano de normas |author= |date= |publisher= |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title=catalog of Mexican rules|accessdate=October 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Program of Training and Consultancy (Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consulta) divides its operation in four components. The ''Programa de Consultoría General'' (Program of General Consultancy), that was created for the projects of major demand identified by chambers and managerial associations, that as well as for state and municipal governments, will look for the support of the Fondo PyME (Fund SME). This program was made to take care of the needs of training and consultancy, across proven methodologies that assure they will have quantifiable results. The ''Programa Moderniza'' (Modernization Program), the Secretary of Economy (SE) and the Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR) started a System of Management named "Modernize" that allows to improve the quality of the services offered to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of the tourist sector. The Secretary of Tourism carries out the consultants' formation, which are the only ones authorized to execute the program and to register in SECTUR. The ''Formación de Consultores PyME&amp;nbsp;– JICA'' (SME Consultants' Formation&amp;nbsp;– JICA) establishes the formation of advisers specialized in the methodology of the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA). The process is based on the application of Japanese tools of improvements of high impact with a lower cost. It lasts approximately one month and a half, and is directed to consultants with more than three years of experience in managerial consultancy. This has allowed relying on a base of specialized consultants that multiplies the efforts to offer specialized services of consultancy that generate more competitive enterprises. The ''Consultoría Empresarial PyME'' (SME Managerial Consultancy-JICA) estimulates the development and consolidation of the MIPyMES by the application of a model of integral attention of standardized consultancy, carried out by the consultants PYME-JICA and accredited by the Secretary of Economy. The process of consultancy that is offered in the facilities of the company lasts from 3 to 4 months, and is directed for MIPYMES, preferably with two years of operation. The Fondo PyME (Fund SME), along with the National Program of Consultancy PYME-JICA, helps with subsidies that go from 30 to 70 percent of the total cost of the service of managerial consultancy.

== PyMEs exports ==
It is proven that many economies are based on their exports. Well organized and structured PyMEs can be a significant source of exports. For this reason, the Mexican government is giving special attention to PyMEs in this regard, allocating a big part of its economic resources to help small and medium size enterprises expand overseas. Supported PyMEs can mean increasing exports and a more open economy.&lt;ref name="semanapyme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.gob.mx |title=semana nacional de PyMEs |author= |date= |publisher=Government |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=national week of support for small and medium size enterprises |accessdate=November 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Subsecretaria para la pequena y mediana empresa" (SPyME) was founded to design, foment and promote programs and other tools that have as objective the creation, consolidation and development of micro, small and medium size enterprises.

About 59% of Mexico's exports are controlled by 30% of the total enterprises in the country. Out of all the PyMEs existing only 9% of them export, while the remaining 83% do not have any type of presence overseas. International Commerce in Mexico is mainly based on big enterprises, this is why government is very interested on giving assistance and financial help to small businesses.

Out of all the exporting enterprises in Mexico only 64,000 are PyMEs. They are located mostly in the center part of the country, northeast and centerwest.

There are many ways PyMEs can be supported in Mexico. Fiscal support to Mexican exporters. VAT return or VAT compensation. Program of foment for the manufacturing industry maquiladora and export services (IMMEX). Also through the program of sectorial promotion. Program of Drawback ( through which Government offers VAT return to those Mexican small businesses that export to a country that has imposed tariffs on imports). There are Benefits to High level exporting enterprises (ALTEX). Benefits to International commerce enterprises (ECEX). Mechanisms of Indirect Exports such as VAT elimination or Application of 0% VAT on exports. Mixed Commission for the Promotion of exports (COMPEX). An annual incentive named National Exporting Price. Government aid such as information or opportunities to expand overseas, consultancy and training. Commercial opportunities such as analysis of the market. Selection and establishment of contact with client within the foreign market. Government may also support PyMEs though a Positioning process.

The most important programs supporting for exports are Financing, Consultancy, Training, Exporting, Technical Assistance and Information on exports.&lt;ref name="Secretaria de Economia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia|title=secretaria de economia|author=|date=|publisher=|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|trans-title=Secretary of Economy|accessdate=2010-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017230209/http://economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia|archivedate=2010-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The services that the ''Programa Nacional de Franquicias'' (Exemption National Program) offers to PyMES are: commercialization, consultancy and financing. Likewise, they approach to the entrepreneurs, MIPyMES and owners of exemptions, to give them supports that offer the opportunity to start a new business taking advantage of the experience of an exemption, stimulate successful business to turn them into exemptions, develop new exemptions. Support the consolidation of the existing exemptions. Export models of Mexican exemptions. Strengthen the positioning of the brand of the existing exemptions and realize the re-engineering of existing models of exemptions.&lt;ref name="Mexico Emprende "&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.contactopyme.gob.mx/archivos/boletin/boletin4.pdf| title=Mexico Emprende |publisher=Contacto PyME|location=Mexico City |language=Spanish|trans-title=Mexico Undertakes |accessdate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PyMExporta Centers are federal, states and local organizations who have the objective of helping the PyMEs that have the special interest to start, increase, or to diversify their exports worldwide. This organizations join efforts with the Business Mexican Sector to achieve this aim.&lt;ref name="PyMExporta" /&gt;

Some of the advantages and benefits that the centers bring to PyMEs are the training of the export process, a specialized consultancy for the development of export projects, the possibility of being able of promote the PyMEs in the international market, consultancy in customs Mexico requirements, information about markets and legal regulations for exports and the support in the tasks of logistics and management. The PyMExporta Centers work with their own register methodology, accompaniment and management of institutional supports according with what the businesses require. The supporting service is personal and specialized for each need of the enterprises.&lt;ref name="PyMExporta" /&gt;

Services are given depending on the levels of the identification of the enterprises potential, in case the enterprises have the facilities to export its product a document will be signed for the development of each process stage of the export. The commerce strategy identifies the requirements of the product, it supports and advises the businessman since the beginning of the contract of international sale until the end of the sale.&lt;ref name="PyMExporta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_cpyme_programas_pymexporta|title=Programas de Centros PyMExporta|publisher=Fondo PyME|location=Mexico City|language=Spanish|trans-title=Programs of PyMExporta Centers|accessdate=October 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008085431/http://economia.gob.mx/swb/es/economia/p_cpyme_programas_pymexporta|archivedate=October 8, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita''''' (''Summary of arithmetic, geometry, proportions and proportionality'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and first published in 1494. It contains a comprehensive summary of [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] mathematics, including practical arithmetic, basic [[algebra]], basic [[geometry]] and [[accounting]], written in [[Italian language|Italian]] for use as a textbook.

The ''Summa'' is the first printed work on algebra in a [[vernacular]] language, and it contains the first published description of the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Treasures - Pacioli's Summa|last=Swetz|first=Frank J|last2=Katz|first2=Victor J|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|work=Loci|date=January 2011|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-paciolis-summa|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set a new standard for writing and argumentation about algebra,&lt;ref name="argument"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Heeffer|first=Albrecht|title=From Problem Solving to Argumentation: Pacioli’s Appropriation of Abbacus Algebra|publisher=[[Ghent University]]|url=http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/Argumentation2.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its impact upon the subsequent development and standardization of professional accounting methods was so great that Pacioli is sometimes referred to as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting|last=Smith|first=L Murphy|date=2011|publisher=[[American Accounting Association]]|url=http://aaahq.org/southwest/pacioli.htm|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Summa de arithmetica'' as originally printed consists of ten chapters on a series of mathematical topics, collectively covering essentially all of Renaissance mathematics. The first seven chapters form a summary of arithmetic in 222 pages. The eighth chapter explains contemporary algebra in 78 pages. The ninth chapter discusses various topics relevant to business and trade, including [[barter]], [[bills of exchange]], weights and measures and [[bookkeeping]], in 150 pages. The tenth and final chapter describes practical geometry (including basic [[trigonometry]]) in 151 pages.&lt;ref name="MARKET"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sangster|first=Alan|last2=Stoner|first2=Gregory N|last3=McCarthy|first3=Patricia|title=THE MARKET FOR LUCA PACIOLI’S ''SUMMA ARITHMETICA''|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|volume=35|number=1|date=June 2008|pages=111–134|url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was dedicated to [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], Duke of [[Urbino]], a patron of the arts whom Pacioli had met in Rome some years earlier.

The book's mathematical content draws heavily on the traditions of the [[abacus school]]s of contemporary northern Italy, where the children of merchants and the middle class studied arithmetic on the model established by [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. The emphasis of this tradition was on facility with computation, using the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], developed through exposure to numerous example problems and case studies drawn principally from business and trade. Pacioli's work likewise teaches through examples, but it also develops arguments for the validity of its solutions through reference to general principles, axioms and logical proof. In this way the ''Summa'' begins to reintegrate the logical methods of classical Greek geometry into the medieval discipline of algebra.&lt;ref name="history of thought"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Pacioli, Luca|encyclopedia=Il Contributo italiano alla storia del Pensiero – Scienze|language=Italian|year=2013|last=Napolitani|first=Pier Daniele|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Il-Contributo-italiano-alla-storia-del-Pensiero:-Scienze%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookkeeping and finance===
Within the chapter on business, a section entitled ''Particularis de computis et scripturis'' (''Details of calculation and recording'') describes the accounting methods then in use among northern-Italian merchants, including [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]], [[trial balance]]s, [[balance sheet]]s and various other tools still employed by professional accountants. The business chapter also introduces the [[rule of 72]] for predicting an investment's [[future value]], anticipating the development of the [[logarithm]] by more than century.&lt;ref name="paccioliLog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Pacioli_logarithm.html|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|website=MacTutor|title=A Napierian logarithm before Napier|last=O'Connor|first=John J|last2=Robertson|first2=Edmund F|date=March 2006|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques did not originate with Pacioli, who merely recorded and explained the established best practices of contemporary businesspeople in his region; still, the ''Summa'''s role in standardizing and disseminating professional bookkeeping methods has earned Pacioli a reputation as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; 

==History and impact==
[[Image:Pacioli summa stamp.jpg|thumb|1994 Italian 750-lira postage stamp commemorating the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication]]
''Summa de arithmetica'' was composed over a period of decades through Pacioli's work as a professor of mathematics, and was probably intended as a textbook and reference work for students of mathematics and business, especially among the mercantile middle class of northern Italy.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; The book was originally published in [[Venice]] in 1494 by [[Paganino Paganini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an identical second edition printed in 1523 in Toscolano.

While the ''Summa'' contained little or no original mathematical work by Pacioli, it was the most comprehensive mathematical text ever published at the time. Its thoroughness and clarity (and the lack of any other similar work available in print) made it a basic point of reference for European mathematicians through the sixteenth century and beyond.&lt;ref name="history of thought"/&gt; The reputation the ''Summa'' earned Pacioli as a mathematician and intellectual inspired [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of [[Milan]], to invite him to serve as a mathematical lecturer in the ducal court, where Pacioli befriended and collaborated with [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The book also marks the beginning of a movement in sixteenth-century algebra toward the use of logical argumentation and [[theorem]]s in the study of algebra, following the model of classical Greek geometry established by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name="argument"/&gt; It includes the first printed example of a set of [[plus and minus signs]] that were to become standard in Italian Renaissance mathematics: 'p' with a tilde above (p̄) for "plus" and 'm' with a tilde (m̄) for minus.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; Pacioli's (incorrect) assertion in the ''Summa'' that there was no general solution to [[cubic equation]]s helped to popularize the problem among contemporary mathematicians, contributing to its eventual solution by [[Scipione del Ferro]].

In 1994 Italy issued a 750-[[Italian lira|lira]] [[postage stamp]] honoring the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication, depicting Pacioli surrounded by mathematical and geometric implements. The image on the stamp was inspired by the ''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', and contains many of the same elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Sovietesque Disappearance of Pacioli’s Rhombicuboctahedron|author=John F.

==Overview==
In simplified terms, the theory of the firm aims to answer these questions:
# Existence. Why do firms emerge? Why are not all transactions in the economy mediated over the market?
# Boundaries. Why is the boundary between firms and the market located exactly there with relation to size and output variety? Which transactions are performed internally and which are negotiated on the market?
# Organization.  Why are firms structured in such a specific way, for example as to hierarchy or decentralization? What is the interplay of formal and informal relationships?
# Heterogeneity of firm actions/performances. What drives different actions and performances of firms?
# Evidence. What tests are there for respective theories of the firm?&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. Hubbard (2008).

Firms exist as an alternative system to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. For example, in a [[labour economics|labor]] [[Market (economics)|market]], it might be very difficult or costly for [[Business|firms]] or organizations to engage in [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand/supply conditions. It might also be costly for [[employees]] to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives. Similarly, it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily. Thus, firms engage in a long-term contract with their employees or a long-term contract with suppliers to minimize the [[cost]] or maximize the value of [[property rights (economics)|property rights]].&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald H. |authorlink= |year=1937 |title=[[The Nature of the Firm]]|journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=[http://www.sonoma.edu/users/e/eyler/426/coase1.pdf 386–405]|url=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt R.

==Background==
The First World War period saw  change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry-level analysis which mainly included analyzing [[Market (economics)|market]]s to analysis at the level of the firm, as it became increasingly clear that [[perfect competition]] was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved. Economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist. [[Market (economics)|Market]]s are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange.

The need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by [[empirical]] studies by [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]], who made it clear that ownership of a typical [[United States|American]] corporation is spread over a wide number of [[shareholder]]s, leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little [[equity (finance)|equity]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Berle and Means"&gt;

==Transaction cost theory==

{{main|Transaction cost}}

[[Image:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png|500px|right|thumb|The model shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the external transaction costs are lower than the internal transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example.]]

According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organise their production in firms when the [[transaction cost]] of coordinating production through the market  exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt;

[[Ronald Coase]] set out his [[transaction cost]] theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first ([[neoclassical economics|neo-classical]]) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt; One aspect of its 'neoclassicism' lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with [[constant returns to scale]], rather than relying on [[increasing returns to scale]].&lt;ref name="Archibald"&gt;Archibald, G.C. (1987 [2008]). "firm, theory of the," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm’s interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: “Within a firm, … market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the [[entrepreneur]] … who directs production.”  He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the [[Bid-offer spread|price mechanism]] and [[economic interventionism|economic planning]]), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. &lt;!-- see john erdman, 2006 --&gt;

Coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production, and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm, with its "distinguishing mark … [of] the supersession of the price mechanism."  Coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise, and dismisses each as unimportant:

# if some people prefer to work under direction and are prepared to pay for the privilege (but this is unlikely);
# if some people prefer to direct others and are prepared to pay for this (but generally people are paid more to direct others);
# if purchasers prefer goods produced by firms.

Instead, for Coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism. These include discovering relevant prices (which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists), as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction (which can be large if there is uncertainty). Moreover, contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re-negotiated. The costs of haggling about division of surplus, particularly if there is [[asymmetric information]] and [[asset specificity]], may be considerable.  &lt;!-- does "surplus" here refer to excess production or to profit? --&gt;

If a firm operated internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance, even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation).  In contrast, a real firm has very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager's power of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid.  These kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships which last long periods of time.  Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical economic theory.  The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, of planning, and of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]].  Coase concludes that “a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short-term contract would be unsatisfactory”, and that “it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty”.

He notes that government measures relating to the market ([[sales tax]]es, [[rationing]], [[price controls]]) tend to increase the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs.  Thus, Coase defines the firm as "the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur."  We can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions.

The question then arises of what determines the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less?  Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm’s costs exceed the market’s costs, and it does not come into existence.)  In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such as a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), or if the relevant prices change frequently.

Coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism, and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs.  These two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Coase (1988).

==Reconsiderations of transaction cost theory==
According to Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock.&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economic Nature of the Firm |last=Putterman |first= Louis |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-47092-7 |page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Barclay Richardson]] for example, notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter-firm co-operation.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;

Klein (1983) asserts that “Economists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual) relationships.” The costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the [[transaction cost]]s.

Ultimately, whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply “a legal fiction”, “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals” (as [[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen]] and [[William H. Meckling|Meckling]] put it) is “a function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra-firm relationships”.&lt;ref name="Jensen and Meckling"&gt;

==Managerial and behavioural theories==
It was only in the 1960s that the neo-classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories. Managerial theories of the firm, as developed by [[William Baumol]] (1959 and 1962), [[Robin Marris]] (1964) and [[Oliver E. Williamson]] (1966), suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own [[utility]] and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit-maximising case. (Baumol suggested that managers’ interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders.) More recently this has developed into ‘[[principal–agent problem|principal–agent]]’ analysis (e.g., Spence and Zeckhauser&lt;ref name="Spence and Zeckhauser"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spence |first=Michael A. |authorlink= |author2=Zeckhauser, Richard  |year=1971 |title=Insurance, Information, and Individual Action |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=380–387 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ross (1973){{citation needed|date=April 2009}} on problems of contracting with asymmetric information) which models a widely applicable case where a principal (a shareholder or firm for example) cannot costlessly infer how an agent (a manager or supplier, say) is behaving. This may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal, or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent’s actions; it is asymmetric information which leads to a problem of [[moral hazard]]. This means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests. Traditional managerial models typically assume that managers, instead of maximising profit, maximise a simple objective utility function (this may include salary, [[Employee benefit|perks]], security, power, prestige) subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint (profit [[satisficing]]).

===Behavioural approach===
{{Main|Behavioural theory of the firm}}
The behavioural approach, as developed in particular by [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] of the [[Carnegie School]] places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and goes well beyond neoclassical economics.&lt;ref name="Cyert and March"&gt;
{{cite book

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this depended on [[Herbert A. Simon]]’s work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that “people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‘[[bounded rationality]]’ when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations”. Thus individuals and groups tend to "[[satisfice]]"—that is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as "satisficing" and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental. Compared to ideal state of productive efficiency, there is organisational slack (Leibenstein’s [[X-inefficiency]]).

===Team production===
[[Armen Alchian]] and Harold Demsetz's analysis of [[team production]] extends and clarifies earlier work by Coase.&lt;ref name="Alchian and Demsetz"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Alchian | first=Armen A.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production, but that the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems (it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co-operating inputs for reward purposes) and attendant shirking (the moral hazard problem) can be overcome, by estimating [[marginal productivity]] by observing or specifying input behaviour. Such monitoring as is therefore necessary, however, can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity’s residual income (otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored, ad infinitum). For Alchian and Demsetz, the firm therefore is an entity which brings together a team which is more productive working together than at arm’s length through the market, because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort. In effect, therefore, this is a "principal-agent" theory, since it is asymmetric information within the firm which Alchian and Demsetz emphasise must be overcome. In Barzel (1982)’s theory of the firm, drawing on Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function (since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm).{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The weakness in Alchian and Demsetz’s argument, according to Williamson, is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of application, as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs. In practice this may have limited applicability (small work group activities, the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra), since most outputs within a firm (such as manufacturing and secretarial work) are separable, so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs. Hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms (in particular, large multi-plant and multi-product firms) exist, etc.

==Asset specificity==
For [[Oliver E. Williamson]], the existence of firms derives from ‘asset specificity’ in production, where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second-best use.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Williamson |first=Oliver E.

 | url=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms (such as purchaser and supplier), because it will lead to protracted [[bargaining]] concerning the [[gains from trade]], because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer [[competing]] with a (possibly large) number of agents in the entire market, and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly: large-numbers bargaining is transformed into small-number bargaining.

If the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one, re-negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade, further increasing the [[transaction cost]]s. Moreover, there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular, firm-specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both; but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re-negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment (this is the [[hold-up problem]], which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them). In this kind of a situation, the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents (or coalitions of agents) may be the removal of one of them from the equation by [[takeover]] or [[merger]]. Asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital, so that the hold-up problem can also occur with labour (e.g. labour can threaten a strike, because of the lack of good alternative [[human capital]]; but equally the firm can threaten to fire).

Probably the best constraint on such opportunism is [[reputation]] (rather than the [[law]], because of the difficulty of [[negotiating]], writing and enforcement of [[contract]]s).  If a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent’s dealings in the future, this alters the [[incentive]]s to be opportunistic.&lt;ref name="Oliar and Sprigman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliar |first=Dotan |authorlink= |author2=Sprigman, Christopher Jon  |year=2008 |title=There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy |journal=Virginal Law Review |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=1787–1867 |url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/content/pdfs/94/1787.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of [[delegation]] (as a firm’s size increase its hierarchical [[bureaucracy]] does too), and the large firm’s increasing inability to replicate the high-powered incentives of the residual income of an owner-entrepreneur. This is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual (increasing the incentives to shirk), and because intervention rights from the centre characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility, thereby diluting incentives. Milgrom and Roberts (1990) explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves, resulting in costs to managers of filtering information, and often the making of decisions without full information.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} This grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy. Empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs.&lt;ref&gt;Barak D. Richman and Jeffrey Mache (2008).

Edited by [[Arne Nygaard]] and [[Robert Dahlstrom]].&lt;/ref&gt; Research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics.

==Firm economies==
The theory of the firm considers what bounds the size and output variety of firms. This includes how firms may be able to combine labour and capital so as to lower the [[average cost]] of output, either from increasing, decreasing, or constant [[returns to scale]] for one product line or from  [[economies of scope]] for more than one product line.&lt;ref name="Archibald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1981). "Economies of Scope," ''American Economic Review'', 71(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815729 p. 268]–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tirole]] (1988). ''The Theory of Industrial Organization''. "The Theory of the Firm," pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIjsF0XONF8C&amp;pg=PA18 18–20.] MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other models==
[[Efficiency wages|Efficiency wage]] models like that of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring, since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk, given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975) suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale-damaging monitoring, where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} (The difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] environment, the latter to a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] one). Leibenstein (1966) sees a firm’s norms or conventions, dependent on its history of management initiatives, labour relations and other factors, as determining the firm’s "culture" of effort, thus affecting the firm’s productivity and hence size.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[George Akerlof]] (1982) develops a gift exchange model of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level, and workers have developed a concern for each other’s welfare, such that all put in effort above the minimum required, but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity; again, size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hans|first1=V. Basil|title=Roles and Responsibilities of Managerial Economists: Empowering Business through Methodology and Strategy|journal=10|date=December 2016|volume=2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the limit to the firm’s size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm.

Recently, [[Yochai Benkler]] further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of “[[commons-based peer production]]” systems such as [[open source software]] (e.g., [[Linux]]), [[Wikipedia]], [[Creative Commons]], etc.  He put forth this argument in ''[[The Wealth of Networks|The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]'', which was released in 2006 under a Creative Commons [[share-alike]] license.&lt;ref name="Benkler"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grossman-Hart-Moore theory ==
In modern [[contract theory]], the “theory of the firm” is often identified with the “property rights approach” that was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver D. Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John H. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thinking about the Firm: A Review of Daniel Spulber's The Theory of the Firm|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jel.49.1.101|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|date = 2011|issn = 0022-0515|pages = 101-113|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/jel.49.1.101|first = Oliver|last = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm is also known as the “Grossman-Hart-Moore theory”. In their seminal work, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995) developed the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691-719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119-1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore|citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.9089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firms, contracts, and financial structure.|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that if contracts cannot specify what is to be done given every possible contingency, then property rights (and hence firm boundaries) matter. Specifically, consider a seller of an intermediate good and a buyer. Should the seller own the physical assets that are necessary to produce the good (non-integration) or should the buyer be the owner (integration)? After relationship-specific investments have been made, the seller and the buyer bargain. When they are symmetrically informed, they will always agree to collaborate. Yet, the division of the ex post surplus depends on the parties’ disagreement payoffs (the payoffs they would get if no ex post agreement were reached), which in turn depend on the ownership structure. Thus, the ownership structure has an influence on the incentives to invest. A central insight of the theory is that the party with the more important investment decision should be the owner. Another prominent conclusion is that joint asset ownership is suboptimal if investments are in human capital. 

The Grossman-Hart-Moore model has been successfully applied in many contexts, e.g. with regard to [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Proper Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to Prisons|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/4/1127|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1127-1161|volume = 112|issue = 4|doi = 10.1162/003355300555448|language = en|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = Andrei|last2 = Shleifer|first3 = Robert W.|last3 = Vishny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have extended the model by considering different bargaining games that the parties may play ex post (which can explain ownership by the less important investor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Noncooperative Bargaining, Hostages, and Optimal Asset Ownership|last = Chiu|first = Y.

In law, a '''voidable floating charge''' refers to a [[floating charge]] entered into shortly prior to the [[company (law)|company]] going into [[liquidation]] which is [[void (law)|void]] or [[unenforceable]] in whole or in part under applicable insolvency legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and section 267 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, a floating charge is only potentially vulnerable if it is entered into within the vulnerability period under applicable law. The vulnerability period is a period prescribed by statute immediately preceding the company going into liquidation. Most jurisdictions provide for alternative vulnerability periods: a longer one for parties who are "connected" to the company, and a shorter one for unrelated third parties.&lt;ref&gt; Under English law, a floating charge in favour of an unconnected third party is only vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 12 months, but a floating charge in favour of a connected person is vulnerable if the company goes into liquidation within the next 2 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of laws relating to voidable floating charges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some countries simply provide that such charge are automatically void or not enforceable,&lt;ref&gt;Under English law they are stated to be "invalid", which is taken to mean unenforceable.&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, they are only [[voidable]] and an application must be made by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or creditor for the floating charge to be set aside.

In most jurisdictions, a floating charge is only vulnerable to the extent that it does not secure new money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 245(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; So if a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an "all-monies" floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a [[security interest]] which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the [[unsecured creditor]]s. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted new money, then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the new money injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.

Most legislation relating to voidable floating charges is also expressed to apply to charges which, as created, were floating charges but which subsequently crystallised into fixed charges.
