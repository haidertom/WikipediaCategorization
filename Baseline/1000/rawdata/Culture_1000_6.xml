'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, pp. xi–xiii. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001).

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]
{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Public access==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Budapest School''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti iskola}}; {{lang-de|Budapester Schule}}) was a [[school of thought]], originally of [[Marxist humanism]], but later of [[Post-Marxism]] and dissident [[Liberalism]] that emerged in [[Hungary]] in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of [[Georg Lukács]]. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on [[social ontology]] and [[aesthetics]], but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory.  Most of the members later came to abandon [[Marxism]]. The School also critiqued the "dictatorship over needs" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.

In a letter to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from [[Western Marxism]].

Members of the school include [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Ferenc Fehér]] [[:hu:Fehér Ferenc (filozófus)|(hu)]], [[György Márkus]], [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and [[Maria Márkus]], among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.

==History==
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of [[actually existing socialism]] and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar [[Simon Tormey]] as "a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'."

Heller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "everyday life". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

The Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from [[Neoclassical Economics]], as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the [[mixed economies]] of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Nordic Model]] was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.

==Ágnes Heller==

Heller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.

The '''ceremonial use of lights''' is found in the practice of many religions.  Candles are extremely common and other forms of light, whether fire or other, are also used.

==Overview==
[[File:Ganges ceremony candles.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hinduism|Hindus]] putting lit oil lamps on the river [[Ganges]].]]

The ceremonial use of lights in the [[Christian Church]] probably has a double origin: in a very non-natural symbolism, and in the adaptation of certain [[pagan]] and [[Jewish]] rites and customs of which the symbolic meaning was Christianized.

Light is everywhere the symbol of joy and of life-giving power, as darkness is of death and destruction. [[Fire]] is an impressive element in worship has been used in many religions. Fire-worship still has its place in at least two of the great religions of the world. The [[Parsis]] adore fire as the visible expression of [[Ahura Mazda]], the eternal principle of light and righteousness; the [[Brahman]]s worship it as divine and omniscient. The [[Hindu]] festival of [[Diwali]] (Diyawali, from diya, light), when temples and houses are illuminated with countless lamps, is held every November to celebrate Lakhshmi, the goddess of prosperity.

In the ritual of the Jewish temple fire and light played a conspicuous part. In the [[Holy of Holies]] was a cloud of light (''shekinali''), symbolical of the presence of [[Yahweh]], and before it stood the candlestick with six branches, on each of which and on the central stem was a lamp eternally burning; while in the forecourt was an altar on which the sacred fire was never allowed to go out. Similarly the Jewish synagogues have each their eternal lamp.

==Ancient Greece &amp; Rome==
[[File:Serapis.JPG|thumb|[[Terracotta]] [[oil lamp]] representing [[Serapis]] ([[British Museum]]).]]

The [[History of Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], too, had their sacred fire and their ceremonial lights. In Greece the Lampadedromia or Lampadephoria (torch-race) had its origin in Greek ceremonies, connected with the relighting of the sacred fire. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;i. 26, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the golden lamp made by [[Callimachus]] which burned night and day in the sanctuary of Athena Polias on the [[Acropolis]], and&lt;ref&gt;vii. 22, ~ 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; tells of a statue of [[Hermes|Hermes Agoraios]], in the market-place of Pharae in Achaea, before which lamps were lighted. Among the Romans lighted candles and lamps formed part of the cult of the domestic tutelary deities; on all festivals doors were garlanded and lamps lighted.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, Sat. xii. 92; Tertullian, Apol. xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cult of Isis]] lamps were lighted by day. In the ordinary temples were candelabra, e.g. that in the temple of Apollo Palatinus at Rome, originally taken by Alexander from Thebes, which was in the form of a tree from the branches of which lights hung like fruit. The lamps in the pagan temples were not symbolical, but votive offerings to the gods. Torches and lamps were also carried in religious processions.

===Lamps for the dead===
The pagan custom of burying lamps with the dead was to provide the dead with the means of obtaining light in the next world; the lamps were for the most part unlighted. It was of Asiatic origin, traces of it having been observed in Phoenicia and in the Punic colonies, but not in Egypt or Greece. In Europe it was confined to the countries under the domination of Rome.

==Early Christian uses==
{{Main|Early Christian Lamps}}

In Christianity, from the very first, fire and light are conceived as symbols, if not as visible manifestations, of the divine nature and the divine presence. Christ is the true Light,&lt;ref&gt;John i. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''and at his transfiguration the fashion Christian of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering'';&lt;ref&gt;Luke ix. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''when the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles, there appeared unto them cloven tongues of fire, and it sat upon each of them'';&lt;ref&gt;Acts ii. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; ''at the conversion of St Paul there shined round him a great light from heaven'';&lt;ref&gt;Acts ix. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; ''while the glorified Christ is represented as standing in the midst of seven candlesticks ... his head and hairs white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire''.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. ~. 14, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians are children of Light at perpetual war with the powers of darkness.

There is no evidence of any ceremonial use of lights in Christian worship during its first two centuries. It is recorded, indeed,&lt;ref&gt;Acts xx. 7, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; that on the occasion of St. Paul's preaching at Alexandria in Troas there were many lights in the upper chamber; but this was at night. And the most that can be hazarded is that a specially large number were lighted as a festive illumination, as in modern Church festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Martigny, Did. des antiqs~. C/fret.&lt;/ref&gt; As to a purely ceremonial use, such early evidence as exists is all the other way. A single sentence of Tertullian&lt;ref&gt;A pal. xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; sufficiently illuminates Christian practice during the 2nd century. ''On days of rejoicing'', he says, ''we do not shade our door-posts with laurels nor encroach upon the day-light with lamp laurels'' (die lacto non laurels pastes obumbramus nec lucernis diem infringimus). Lactantius, writing early in the 4th century, is even more sarcastic in his references to the heathen practice. ''They kindle lights'', he says, ''as though to one who is in darkness. Can he be thought sane who offers the light of lamps and candles to the Author and Giver of all light? ''.&lt;ref&gt;Div. Inst. vi. de vero cultu, cap. 2, in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]] vi. 637.&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily an attack on votive lights, and does not necessarily exclude their ceremonial use in other ways. There is, indeed, evidence that they were so used before Lactantius wrote. The 34th canon of the [[Synod of Elvira]] (305), which was contemporary with him, forbade candles to be lighted in cemeteries during the daytime, which points to an established custom as well as to an objection to it; and in the Roman catacombs lamps have been found of the 2nd and 3rd centuries which seem to have.&lt;ref&gt;J. Toutain, in Daremberg and Saglio, Diaionnaire, s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucerna been ceremonial or symbolical. Again, according to the [[Acta of St Cyprian]] (died 258), his body was borne to the grave ''praelucentibus cereis'', and Prudentius, in his hymn on the 2nd and martyrdom of St Lawrence,&lt;ref&gt;Peristeph. ii. 71, in Migne, centuries. Patr. Lat. lx. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; says that in the time of St Laurentius, i.e. the middle of the 3rd century, candles stood in the churches of Rome on golden candelabra. The gift, mentioned by Anastasius,&lt;ref&gt;in Sylv.&lt;/ref&gt; made by Constantine to the Vatican basilica, of a pharum of gold, garnished with 500 dolphins each holding a lamp, to burn before St Peters tomb, points also to a custom well established before Christianity became the state religion.

Whatever previous custom may have been and for the earliest ages it is difficult to determine absolutely because the Christians held their services at night. By the close of the 4th century the ceremonial use of lights had become firmly and universally established in the Church. This is clear, to pass by much other evidence, from the controversy of [[St Jerome]] with Vigilantius.

[[Vigilantius]], a presbyter of [[Barcelona]], still occupied the position of Tertullian and Lactantius in this matter. ''We see'', he wrote, ''a rite peculiar to the pagans introduced into the churches on pretext of religion, and, while the sun is still shining, a mass of wax tapers lighted. ... A great honor to the blessed martyrs, whom they think to illustrate with contemptible little candles'' (de pilissimis cereolis). Jerome, the most influential theologian of the day, took up the cudgels against Vigilantius, who, in spite of his fatherly admonition, had dared again to open his foul mouth and send forth a filthy stink against the relics of the holy martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Hier. Ep. cix. al. 53 ad Ripuarium Presbyt., in Migne, Patr. Lat. p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt; ''If candles are lit before their tombs, are these the ensigns of idolatry?'' In his treatise contra Vigilantium&lt;ref&gt;Patr. Lat. t. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; he answers the question with much common sense. ''There can be no harm if ignorant and simple people or religious women, light candles in honor of the martyrs. We are not born, but reborn, Christians, and that which when done for idols was detestable is acceptable when done for the martyrs. As in the case of the woman with the precious box of ointment, it is not the gift that merits reward, but the faith that inspires it.'' As for lights in the churches, he adds that in all the churches of the East, whenever the gospel is to be read, lights are lit, though the sun be rising (jam sole rutilante), not in order to disperse the darkness, but as a visible sign of gladness (ad signum ketitiae demonstrandum). Taken in connection with a statement which almost immediately precedes this ''Cereos autem non clara luce accendimus, sicut frustra calumniaris: sed ut noctis tenebras hoc solatio temperemus '', this seems to point to the fact that the ritual use of lights in the church services, so far as already established, arose from the same conservative habit as determined the development of liturgical vestments, i.e. the lights which had been necessary at the nocturnal meetings were retained, after the hours of service had been altered, and invested with a symbolical meaning.

Already they were used at most of the conspicuous functions of the Church. [[Paulinus, bishop of Nola]] (died 431), describes the altar at the eucharist as ''crowned with crowded lights'', and even mentions the ''eternal lamp''. For their use at baptisms we have, among much other evidence, that of [[Zeno of Verona]] for the West, and that of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] for the East. Their use at funerals is illustrated by Eusebius's description of the burial of Constantine, and Jerome's account of that of [[Saint Paula]]. At ordinations they were used, as is shown by the 6th canon of the [[Council of Carthage (398)]], which decrees that the acolyte is to hand to the newly ordained deacon ''ceroferarium cum cereo''. This symbolism was not pagan, i.e. the lamps were not placed in the graves as part of the furniture of the dead; in the Catacombs they are found only in the niches of the galleries and the arcosolia, nor can they have been votive in the sense popularized later. ''Clara coronantur densis altaria lychnis''.&lt;ref&gt;Poem. De S. Felice natal itium, xiv. ~, in Migne, Patr. Lat. lxi. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Continuum scyphus est argenteus aptus ad usum. Sal, ignis et oleum.&lt;ref&gt;Lib. i. Tract. xiv. 4, in Migne, xi. 358. i In sanct. Pasch. c. 2; Migne, ''[[Patrologia graeca]]'', xxxvi. 624; Vita Constantini, iv. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cum alii Pontifices lampads cereosque proferrent, alii choras psallentium ducerent.''.&lt;ref&gt;Ep. cviii. ad Eustochium virginem, in Migne.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
As to the blessing of candles, according to the ''[[Liber pontificalis]]'' [[Pope Zosimus]] in 417 ordered these to be blessed, and the Gallican and Mozarabic rituals also provided for this ceremony. [[Candlemas|The Feast of the Purification of the Virgin]], known as Candlemas, because on this day the candles for the whole year are blessed, was established according to some authorities by [[Pope Gelasius I]] about 492. As to the question of altar lights, however, it must be borne in mind that these were not placed upon the altar, or on a retable behind it, until the 12th century. These were originally the candles carried by the deacons, according to the ''[[Ordo Romanus]]'' (i. 8; ii. 5; iii. 7) seven in number, which were set down, either on the steps of the altar, or, later, behind it. In certain of the [[Eastern Churches]] to this day, there are no lights on the high altar; the lighted candles stand on a small altar beside it, and at various parts of the service are carried by the lectors or acolytes before the officiating [[priest]] or [[deacon]]. The crowd of lights described by Paulinus as crowning the altar were either grouped round it or suspended in front of it; they are represented by the sanctuary lamps of the [[Latin Church]] and by the crown of lights suspended in front of the altar in. the Greek.

To trace the gradual elaboration of the symbolism and use of ceremonial lights in the Church, until its full development and systematization in the Middle Ages, would be impossible here. It must suffice to note a few stages in development of the process. The burning of lights before the tombs of [[martyr]]s led naturally to their being burned also before relics and lastly before images and pictures. This latter practice, hotly denounced as idolatry during the [[iconoclastic controversy]], was finally established as orthodox by the [[Second General Council of Nicaea]] (787), which restored the use of images. A later development, however, by which certain lights themselves came to be regarded as objects of worship and to have other lights burned before them, was condemned as idolatrous by the [[Synod of Noyon]] in 1344. The passion for symbolism extracted ever new meanings out of the candles and their use. Early in the 6th century [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]], [[bishop of Pavia]], pointed out the threefold elements of a wax candle (Opusc. ix. and x.), each of which would make it an offering acceptable to God; the rush-wick is the product of pure water, the wax is the offspring of virgin, bees in the flame is sent from heaven.12 Clearly, wax was a symbol of the [[Blessed Virgin]] and the holy humanity of Christ. The later Middle Ages developed the idea. [[Guillaume Durand|Durandus]], in his Rationale, interprets the wax as the body of Christ, the wick as his soul, the flame as his divine nature; and the consuming candle as symbolizing his passion and death.

This may be the [[Paschal Candle]] only. In some codices the text runs: ''Per parochias concessit licentiam benedicendi Cereum Paschalem''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Du Cange]], Glossarium, sv. Cereum Paschale.&lt;/ref&gt; In the three variants of the notice of Zosimus given in Duchesnes edition of the ''Liber pontificalis'' (I~86I892) the word cera is, however, alone used. Nor does the text imply that he gave to the suburbican churches a privilege hitherto exercised by the metropolitan church. The passage runs: Hic constituit ut diaconi leva tecta haberent de palleis linostimis per parrochias et ut cera benedicatur, &amp;c. Per parrochias here obviously refers to the head-gear of the deacons, not to the candles.

See also the ''Peregrinoiio Sylviae'' (386), 86, &amp;c., for the use of lights at Jerusalem, and [[Isidore of Seville]]&lt;ref&gt;Elym. vii. 12; xx. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; for the usage in the West. That even in the 7th century the blessing of candles was by no means universal is proved by the 9th canon of the [[Council of Toledo]] (671):''De benedicendo cereo et lucerna in privilegiis Paschae''. This canon states that candles and lamps are not blessed in some churches, and that inquiries have been made why we do it. In reply, the council decides that it should be done to celebrate the mystery of Christ's resurrection. See Isidore of Seville, Conc., in Migne, Pat, tat. lxxxiv. 369.

==Eastern Christian usage==
[[File:Drevnosti RG v1 ill073a - Russian Candle.jpg|thumb|left|Church candle]]
[[File:5267-20080122-jerusalem-tomb-of-jesus.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Jesus, inside the [[Edicule]]. [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]. This is where the [[Holy Fire]] manifests itself.]]
[[File:Białowieża cerkiew świecznik 2007.jpg|thumb|Candlestand in an Eastern Orthodox church.]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], there is a large amount of ceremonial use of light.

The most important usage is the reception of the [[Holy Fire]] at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the afternoon of [[Holy Saturday]]. This flame is often taken by the faithful to locations all over the world.

===The temple===
When a new [[Orthodox church (building)|temple]] (church building) is [[consecrated]] the [[bishop]] kindles a flame in the sanctuary which traditionally should burn perpetually from that time forward. This [[sanctuary lamp]] is usually an [[oil lamp]] located either on or above the [[Holy Table]] (altar). In addition, in the Eastern Orthodox Church there must be candles on the Holy Table during the celebration of the [[Divine Liturgy]]. In some places this takes the form of a pair of white candles, in others, it may be a pair of five-branch candlesticks. There is also traditionally a [[Menorah (Temple)|seven-branch candlestick]] on or behind the Holy Table, recalling the one mandated in the Old Testament [[Tabernacle]] and the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

Around the temple, there are a number of oil lamps burning in front of the [[icon]]s, especially on the [[iconostasis]]. Additionally, the faithful will offer [[beeswax]] [[candle]]s in candle stands in front of important icons. The faithful offer candles as they pray for both the living and the [[prayer for the dead|departed]]. It is customary during [[funeral]]s and [[panikhida|memorial services]] for everyone to stand holding lit candles. Often everyone will either extinguish their candles or put them in a candle stand at a certain point near the end of the memorial service to indicate that at some point, everyone will have to surrender their soul to God.

===Special moments===
The reading from the [[Gospel Book]] must always be accompanied by lighted candles, as a sign that Christ is the [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|Light which enlightens all]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:4-5|KJV}}). When the priest and deacon [[thurible|cense]] the temple, the deacon will walk with a lighted candle. During [[Crucession|processions]], and in some places during the [[Entrance (Liturgical)|liturgical entrances]], either candles or lanterns are carried by [[altar server]]s. On certain [[feast day]]s, the clergy, and sometimes all of the faithful, will stand holding candles for certain solemn moments during the service. This is especially so during [[Holy Week]] during the reading of the 12 [[Passion Gospels]] on [[Great Friday]], and the Lamentations around the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] on [[Great Saturday]].

Certain moments during the [[All Night Vigil]] will be accentuated by the lighting or extinguishing of lamps or candles. The [[Polyeleos]] is an important moment in the service when all of the lamps and candles in the church should be illuminated.

Whenever the [[bishop]] celebrates the divine services, he will bless with a pair of candlesticks known as [[dikirion and trikirion]], holding two and three candles, respectively.

===In the home===
The faithful will often keep a lamp burning perpetually in their [[icon corner]]. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], it is customary to try to preserve the flame from the service of the 12 Passion Gospels and bring it home to bless their house: there is a custom of using the flame from this candle to mark a cross on the lintel of one's doorway before entering after the service, and of then using the flame to re-kindle the lamp in the icon corner.

===Paschal Vigil and Bright Week===
[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Local church|congregation]] lighting their candles from the new flame which the priest has retrieved from the altar ([[St. George Greek Orthodox Church, Adelaide|St. George Greek Orthodox Church]], in [[Adelaide]], Australia).]]
During the [[Paschal Vigil]], after the [[Midnight Office]], all of the candles and lamps in the temple are extinguished, with the exception of the sanctuary lamp behind the iconostasis, and all wait in silence and darkness. (In Orthodox churches, when possible, the [[Holy Fire]] arrives from the Holy Sepulchre during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the flame in the sanctuary lamp.)  At the stroke of midnight, the priest [[thurible|censes]] around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the sanctuary lamp. Then the Holy Doors are opened and all the people light their candles from the [[Paschal troitza|priest's candle]]. Then, all the clergy and the people exit the church and go in procession three times around it holding lighted candles and singing a hymn of the resurrection.

During the Paschal Vigil, and throughout [[Bright Week]], the priest will hold a special paschal candle—in the Greek tradition a single candle, in the Slavic tradition a triple candlestick—at the beginning of the service, whenever he senses, and at other special moments during the service. In the Slavic tradition, the [[deacon]] also carries a special paschal candle which he holds at the beginning, whenever he senses, and whenever he chants an [[ektenia]] (litany).

==Oriental Orthodox==
In the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], it is customary to light [[bonfire]]s on the [[feast day|Feast]] of [[Timkat]] ([[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]).

==Roman Catholic usage in the early 20th century==
In the Latin Church or [[Roman Catholic Church]], the use of ceremonial lights falls under three heads. (1) They may be symbolical of the light of Gods presence, of Christ as Light Roman of Light, or of the children of Light in conflict with Catholic the powers of darkness; they may even be no more than expressions of joy on the occasion of great festivals. (2) They may be [[votive]], i.e. offered as an act of worship (latria) to God. (3) They are, in virtue of their benediction by the Church, sacramental id, i.e. efficacious for the good of men's souls and bodies, and for the confusion of the powers of darkness. With one or more of these implications, they are employed in all the public functions of the Church. At the consecration of a church twelve lights are placed around the walls at the twelve spots. Dedication where these are anointed by the bishop with holy oil, of a and on every anniversary these are relighted; at the church, dedication of an altar tapers are lighted and censed at each place where the table is anointed (Pontificale Rom. p. ii.

[[File:Znicze franciszkanska.jpg|thumb|left|Candles burning in [[Kraków]] after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]].]]

At every liturgical service, and especially at Mass and at choir services, there must be at least two lighted tapers on the altar, as symbols of the presence at Mass of God and tributes of adoration. For the Mass the rule is that there are six lights at High Mass, four at missa [[cantata]], and two at private masses. At a Pontifical High Mass (i.e. when the bishop celebrates) the lights are seven, because seven golden candlesticks surround the risen Saviour, the chief bishop of the Church (see Rev. i. 12). At most pontifical functions, moreover, the bishop as the representative of Christ is preceded by an acolyte with a burning candle (bugia) on a candlestick. The Ceremoniale Episcoporum (i. 12) further orders that a burning lamp is to hang at all times before each altar, three in front of the high altar, and five before the reserved Sacrament, as symbols of the eternal Presence. In practice, however, it is usual to have only one [[Altar lamp]] lighted before the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] in which the Host is reserved. The special symbol of the real presence of Christ is the Sanctus candle, which is lighted at the moment of consecration and kept burning until the communion. The same symbolism is intended by the lighted tapers which must accompany the Host whenever it is carried in procession, or to the sick and dying.

As symbols of light and joy, a candle is held on each side of the deacon when reading the Gospel at Mass; and the same symbolism underlies the multiplication of lights on festivals, their number varying with the importance of the occasion. As to the number of these latter no rule is laid down. They differ from liturgical lights in that, whereas these must be tapers of pure beeswax or lamps fed with pure olive oil (except by special dispensation under Certain circumstances), those used merely to add splendour to the celebration may be of any material; the only exception being, that in the decoration of the altar, gas-lights are forbidden.

In general, the ceremonial use of lights in the Roman Catholic Church is conceived as a dramatic representation in fire of the life of Christ and of the whole scheme of salvation. On [[Easter]] Eve the new fire, symbol of the light of the newly risen Christ, is produced, and from this are kindled all the lights used throughout the Christian year until, in the gathering darkness (tenebrae) of the Passion, they are gradually extinguished. This quenching of the light of the world is symbolized at the service of [[Tenebrae]] in Holy Week by the placing on a stand before the altar of thirteen lighted tapers arranged pyramidally, the rest of the church being in darkness. The [[penitential psalms]] are sung, and at the end of each a candle is extinguished. When only the central one is left it is taken down and carried behind the altar, thus symbolizing the nocturnal darkness, so our hearts are illumined by invisible fire, &amp;c. (Missale Rom.). In the form for the blessing of candles extra diem Purificationis B. Mariae Virg. the virtue of the consecrated candles in discomfiting demons is specially brought out: that in whatever places they may be lighted, or placed, the princes of darkness may depart, and tremble, and may fly terror-stricken with all their ministers from those habitations, nor presume further to disquiet and molest those who serve thee, Almighty God (Rituale Rom.)

[[Altar]] [[candlesticks]] consist of five parts: the foot, stem, knob in the centre, bowl to catch the drippings, and pricket (a sharp point on which the candle is fixed). It is permissible to use a long tube, pointed to imitate a candle, in which a small taper is forced to the top by a spring (Cong. Rit., tIth May I&amp;78).

===Easter===
On Easter Eve new fire is made with a flint and steel, and blessed; from this three candles are lighted, the ''lumen Christi'', and from these again the [[Paschal Candle]]. This is the symbol of the risen and victorious Christ, and burns at every solemn service until Ascension Day, when it is extinguished and removed after the reading of the Gospel at High Mass. This, of course, symbolizes the Ascension; but meanwhile the other lamps in the church have received their light from the Paschal Candle, and so symbolize throughout the year the continued presence of the light of Christ.

===Baptism===
At the [[consecration]] of the baptismal water the burning Paschal Candle is dipped into the [[baptismal font|font]] so that the power of the [[Holy Ghost]] may descend into it and make it an effective instrument of regeneration. This is the symbol of [[baptism]] as rebirth as children of Light. Lighted tapers are also placed in the hands of the newly baptized, or of their god-parents, with the admonition to preserve their baptism inviolate, so that they may go to meet the Lord when he comes to the wedding. Thus, too, as children of Light, candidates for ordination and novices about to take the vows carry lights. when they come before the bishop; and the same idea 17, CEo. underlies the custom of carrying lights at weddings, at the first communion, and by priests going to their first mass, though none of these are liturgically prescribed. Finally, lights are placed around the bodies of the dead and carried beside them to the grave, partly as symbols that they still live in the light of Christ, partly to frighten away the powers of darkness.

===Funeral===
During the [[funeral]] service, the Paschal Candle is placed, burning, near the coffin, as a reminder of the deceased's [[baptismal vows]] and hope of eternal life and salvation brought about by the [[death and resurrection of Jesus]], and of faith in the [[resurrection of the dead]].

===Excommunication===
Conversely, the extinction of lights is part of the ceremony of [[excommunication]] (Pontificale Rom. pars iii.). Regino, abbot of Prum, describes the ceremony as it was carried out in his day, when its terrors were yet unabated (De eccles. disciplina, Excom ii. 409). Twelve priests should stand about the bishop, holding in their hands lighted torches, which at the conclusion of the [[anathema]] or excommunication they should cast down and trample under foot. When the excommunication is removed, the symbol of reconciliation is the handing to the penitent of a burning taper.

==Anglican usage==
In the [[Church of England]] the practice has been less consistent. The first [[Book of Common Prayer]] directed two lights to be placed on the altar. This direction was omitted in the second Prayer-book; but the Ornaments Rubric of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s Prayer-book again made them obligatory. The question of how far this did so is a much-disputed one and is connected with the whole problem of the meaning and scope of the rubric. Uncertainty reigns with regard to the actual usage of the Church of England from the Reformation onwards. Lighted candles certainly continued to burn in Queen Elizabeth's chapel, to the scandal of Protestant zealots. They also seem to have been retained in certain cathedral and collegiate churches. There is, however, no mention of ceremonial candles in the detailed account of the services of the Church of England given by [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] (Description of England, 1570). They seem never to have been illegal under the [[Acts of Uniformity]]. The use of wax lights and tapers formed one of the indictments brought by [[Peter Smart]], a [[Puritan]] prebendary of Durham, against Dr. Burgoyne, [[John Cosin]] and others for setting up superstitious ceremonies in the cathedral contrary to the Act of Uniformity. The indictments were dismissed in 1628 by [[Sir James Whitelocke]], chief justice of Chester and a judge of the Kings Bench, and in 1629 by [[Sir Henry Yelverton]], a judge of Common Pleas and himself a strong Puritan.&lt;ref&gt;Hierurgia Anglicana, ii pp. 230 seq.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ceremonial lights was among the indictments in the impeachment of Laud and other bishops by the House of Commons, but these were not based on the Act of Uniformity. From the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] onwards the use of ceremonial lights, though far from universal, was usual again in cathedrals and collegiate churches.

It was not, however, until the [[Oxford Movement]] of the 19th century that their use was widely extended in parish churches. The growing custom met with some opposition; the law was appealed to, and in 1872 the Privy Council declared altar lights to be illegal (Martin v. Mackonochie). This judgment, founded as was afterwards admitted on insufficient knowledge, produced no effect. In the absence of any authoritative negative pronouncement, churches returned to practically the whole ceremonial use of lights as practised in the Roman Catholic Church.

The matter was again raised in the case of Read and others v. the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], one of the counts of the indictment being that the bishop had, during the celebration of Holy Communion, allowed two candles to be alight on a shelf or retable behind the communion table when they were not necessary for giving light. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in whose court the case was heard (1889), decided that the mere presence of two candles on the table, burning during the service but lit before it began, was lawful under the first Prayer-Book of Edward VI. and had never been made unlawful. On the case being appealed to the [[Privy Council]], this particular indictment was dismissed on the ground that the [[vicar]], not the [[bishop]], was responsible for the presence of the lights.

The custom of placing lighted candles around the bodies of the dead, especially when lying in state, has never wholly died out in the Anglican communion. In the 18th century, moreover, it was still customary in England to accompany a funeral with lighted tapers.&lt;ref&gt;Picart (op. cit. 1737)&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary illustration shows a funeral cortege preceded and accompanied by boys, each carrying four lighted candles in a branched candlestick. The usage in this respect in [[Anglo-Catholic]] churches is a revival of pre-Reformation ceremonial as is found in the Roman Catholic Church.

In the [[Church of Ireland]], a branch of Anglicanism that is both Catholic and Apostolic in origins and in the closest historical and doctrinal communion with the younger Church of England, but with a more generally robust middle- to low-church tradition in ritual, the use of candles and lanterns of all kinds is canonically forbidden except for the specific purpose of "giving light" during services.   This conforms to that Church's similar abjuring of, for example, [[incense]], all but rather simple clerical [[vestments]], [[mitre]]s, eucharistic wafers, the [[Reserved Sacrament]] and the elevation of the sacred elements in the [[Eucharist]].

==Protestant usage==
As a result of the Reformation, the use of ceremonial lights was either greatly modified, or totally abolished in the [[Protestant|Protestant Churches]]. In the Reformed ([[Calvinistic]]) Churches altar lights were, with the rest, done away with entirely as popish and superstitious. In the [[Lutheran|Lutheran Churches]] they were retained, and in Evangelical Germany have even survived most of the other medieval rites and ceremonies (e.g. the use of vestments) which were not abolished at the Reformation itself. The custom of placing lighted candles around the bodies of the dead is still practised by some Protestants.

==Usage in Hinduism==
In almost all [[Hinduism|Hindu]] homes, lamps are lit daily, sometimes before an [[altar]]. In some houses, [[oil lamps]] or candles are lit at dawn, in some houses they are lit at both dawn and dusk, and in a few, lamps are maintained continuously.

A [[Diya (light)|diya]], or clay lamp, is frequently used in Hindu celebrations and forms an integral part of many social rites. It is a strong symbol of enlightenment, hope, and prosperity. [[Diwali]] is the festival of lights celebrated by followers of [[dharmic religion]]s.

In its traditional and simplest form, the diya is made from baked clay or [[terracotta]] and holds oil or [[ghee]] that is lit via a cotton wick.

Traditional diyas have now evolved into a form wherein waxes are used as replacements for oils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhsenseindia.com/prodgallery/gallery/89.jpg sample of a traditional earthen clay lamp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072138/http://www.seventhsenseindia.com/prodgallery/gallery/89.jpg |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Sikhism==
Lamps are lit in [[Sikhism]] on [[Diwali]], the festival of light, as well as being lit everyday by followers of [[Dharmic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Peoples of Eastern Asia | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | year = 2004 | page = 223 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RW92mFLB6n0C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=candles+diwali+sikh&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=JC8i3J4jOYyUQdBzRqJsILU6Dis#PPA223,M1 | isbn = 0-7614-7551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candles are a traditional part of [[Buddhist]] ritual observances. Along with [[incense]] and flowers, candles (or some other type of light source, such as butter lamps) are placed before Buddhist shrines or images of the Buddha as a show of respect. They may also be accompanied by offerings of food and drink.&lt;ref name=Teece&gt;{{cite book | last = Teece | first = Geoff  | title = Buddhism | publisher = Black Rabbit Books | year = 2004 | page = 24 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Qn7hiIFGNzUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=candles+buddhism&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=Ojy2gdW9DAx9aRMi7X8DtoL4kxw#PPA24,M1   | isbn = 1-58340-464-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light of the candles is described as representing the light of the Buddha's teachings, echoing the metaphor of light used in various Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref name=Teece/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html#offerings |title=Lay Buddhist Practice by Bhikkhu Khantipalo |publisher=Accesstoinsight.org |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Ubon Ratchathani Candle Festival]]'' for an example of a Buddhist festival that makes extensive use of candles.

In [[Christianity]] the candle is commonly used in [[worship]] both for decoration and ambiance, and as a symbol that represents the light of [[God]] or, specifically, the light of [[Christ]]. The [[altar candle]] is often placed on the altar, usually in pairs. Candles are also carried in [[procession]]s, especially to either side of the [[processional cross]]. A [[votive candle]] or taper may be lit as an accompaniment to [[prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = Jean C.  | title = Dictionary of Christianity | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1996 | page = 43 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lriWCwsBDNwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=candle+christianity&amp;sig=s-N5ES354hr792oKI88yAfYOp84#PPA43,M1 | isbn = 1-884964-49-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candles are lit by worshippers in front of [[icon]]s in [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Catholic]] and other churches. This is referred to as "offering a candle", because the candle is a symbol of the worshiper offering himself or herself to God (and proceeds from the sale of the candle are [[wikt:offering|offerings]] by the faithful which go to help the church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eastmond | first = Antony  |author2=Liz James|author3=Robin Cormack | title = Icon and Word: the power of images in Byzantium | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2003  | page = 145 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w2_gvJC9v8UC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=offering+a+candle+icon&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=VJiQcCfN3A2s67FvuGPqmgVctqI | isbn = 0-7546-3549-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Eastern Orthodox, there are times when the entire congregation stands holding lit tapers, such as during the reading of the [[Matins Gospel]]s on [[Good Friday]], the Lamentations on [[Holy Saturday]], [[funeral]]s, [[Pannikhida|Memorial services]], etc. There are also special candles that are used by Orthodox clergy. A bishop will bless using [[dikirion and trikirion]] (candlesticks holding two and three candles, respectively). At [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter) the priest holds a special [[Paschal trikirion]], and the deacon holds a [[Paschal candle]]. The priest will also bless the faithful with a single candle during the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] (celebrated only during [[Great Lent]]).

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] a liturgical candle must be made of at least 51% beeswax, the remainder may be paraffin or some other substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anson | first = Peter F.  | title = Churches – Their Plan and Furnishing | publisher = READ BOOKS | year = 2007 | page = 111 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yJFLDzqEBeEC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=liturgical+candle+51%25+wax&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=r3wtu9v30ZXoqqp---00DzWgY7Q | isbn = 1-4067-5889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Orthodox Church, the tapers offered should be 100% beeswax, unless poverty makes this impossible. The stumps from burned candles can be saved and melted down to make new candles.

In some [[Western Christianity|Western churches]], a special candle known as the ''[[Paschal candle]]'', specifically represents the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Christ]] and is lit only at [[Easter]], [[funeral]]s, and [[baptism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stravinskas | first = Peter M.

In Sweden (and other [[Scandinavia]]n countries), [[Saint Lucy|St. Lucia Day]] is celebrated on December 13 with the [[crown (headgear)|crowning]] of a young girl with a wreath of candles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miles | first = Clement A.  | title = Christmas Customs and Traditions: Their History and Significance | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1976 | pages = 221–224 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1XRjAyL8LogC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=sweden+st+lucia+day+candle&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=Hp1Q08o1xpL1wcV4ZAnx77-E-T4#PPA224,M1 | isbn = 0-486-23354-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Western churches, a group of candles arranged in a ring, known as an [[Advent wreath]], are used in church services in the Sundays leading up to Christmas.  In households in some Western European countries, a single candle marked with the days of December is gradually burned down, day by day, to mark the passing of the days of Advent; this is called an [[Advent candle]].

;Humanism
For some [[Humanism|Humanists]] the candle is used as a symbol of the light of [[reason]] or [[rationality]]. The Humanist festival of [[HumanLight]] often features a candle-lighting ceremony.

;Satanism
During satanic rituals black candles are the only light source, except for one white candle on the altar. The dim lighting is used to create an air of mystique and the color of the candles has symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, The Satanic Bible, pp. 136-137. {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Unitarian Universalism
A common element of worship in many [[Unitarian Universalism]] churches and fellowships is the lighting of candles of joy and concern.  Here members of the congregation may come up to the altar or chancel, light a votive or other candle, and share a personal concern or joy with the community.  Unitarian Universalism also incorporates candle-lighting ceremonies from other spiritual traditions, from which they draw inspiration. A [[flaming chalice]] is the most widely used symbol of [[Unitarianism]] and Unitarian Universalism, and is, in reality, usually a candle, not an actual [[chalice]] of burning oil.

;Wicca
In [[Wicca]] and related forms of [[Paganism]], the candle is frequently used on the altar to represent the presence of the God and Goddess, and in the four corners of a ritual circle to represent the presence of the four [[classical element]]s: [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Water (classical element)|Water]]. When used in this manner, lighting and extinguishing the candle marks the opening and closing of the ritual. The candle is also frequently used for [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] meditative purposes. Altar candles are traditionally thick tall candles or long tapers which are available in many colors.  In Wicca, the candles that are used come in a variety of colors, depending on the nature of the ritual or custom at hand.  Some Wiccans may use red, green, blue, yellow and white or purple candles to represent the elements.

Using candles in magic based on Wiccan beliefs is known as "sympathetic magick" in that it is believed the candle represents the outcome the person is wanting.  It is a "like attracts like" form of magical practice.  For example, if a person is looking for a job or needs extra income a green candle (the color of American dollars) would be used.  For romance, a red candle would be used (red is a universal color of love and hearts).  There is an additional belief that the smoke from the candles will take the prayer requests, desires, or wishes up to the gods.

;Raqs sharqi

In [[raqs sharqi]], candles are used as a complementary element in some [[dance style]]s. The candles can be held either on the dancer's hand or above her head, depending on what the [[choreography]] demands.

A '''civilization''' or '''civilisation''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|English spelling differences]]) is any [[complex society]] characterized by [[urban area|urban development]], [[social stratification]] imposed by a cultural [[elite]], [[symbol]]ic systems of communication (for example, [[writing system]]s), and a perceived separation from and domination over the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adams, Robert McCormick|title=The Evolution of Urban Society|year=1966|page=13|publisher=Transaction Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZOwKU0TlsC&amp;q=%22civilizations+are+associated%22|isbn=9780202365947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Haviland, William|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|page=250|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|display-authors=etal|isbn=978-1285675305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Wright|title=A Short History of Progress|publisher=House of Anansi|year=2004|pages=115, 117, and 212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzWPFQIEvfEC&amp;q=%22technical,%20anthropological%22|isbn=9780887847066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Josep|last=Llobera|title=An Invitation to Anthropology|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2003|pages=136–137|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_-LDyWxODjAC&amp;q=%22best-known+definition%22|isbn=9781571815972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernández-Armesto 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2001|url= https://books.google.com/?id=3MNzi698aXwC|isbn=9780743216500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyden|first=Stephen Vickers|title=The Biology of Civilisation|year=2004|pages=7–8|publisher=UNSW Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TX78DfVbM7kC&amp;q=%22the+essential+precondition%22|isbn=9780868407661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franz|last=Solms-Laubach|title=Nietzsche and Early German and Austrian Sociology|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2007|pages=115, 117, and 212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxTITNduFc4C&amp;dq|isbn=9783110181098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|page=8|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including [[centralization]], the [[domestication]] of both humans and other organisms, [[division of labor|specialization of labour]], culturally ingrained [[Idea of Progress|ideologies of progress]] and [[supremacism]], [[monument]]al [[architecture]], [[taxation]], societal dependence upon [[farming]] and [[expansionism]].&lt;ref name="Haviland 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyden 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solms-Laubach 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historically, civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, in contrast to smaller, supposedly [[primitive culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Adams 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llobera 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolesti|first=Maria|title=Barbarism and Its Discontents|year=2013|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpZZKabXvWAC|isbn=9780804785372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some scholars have described civilization as being necessarily multicultural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|journal=Globality Studies Journal|year=2011|issue=24|title=Civilization and Culture|first=Ruan |url=https://gsj.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/0024Wei.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of [[nomadic pastoralist]]s, [[Neolithic]] societies or [[hunter-gather]]ers, but it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. As an uncountable noun, "civilization" also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social class]]es with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Sources of Social Power |last=Mann |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=34–41 |author-link=Michael Mann (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], culminating in the relatively rapid process of [[urban revolution]] and [[state formation]], a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.

== History of the concept ==
The English word ''civilization'' comes from the [[Early modern France|16th-century French]] ''civilisé'' ("civilized"), from Latin ''civilis'' ("civil"), related to ''civis'' ("citizen") and ''civitas'' ("city").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3041K2Zv76AC&amp;pg=PT73 |title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences |last=Sullivan |first=Larry E. |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781412951432 |page=73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental treatise is [[Norbert Elias]]'s ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939), which traces social [[mores]] from [[Court (royal)|medieval courtly society]] to the [[Early Modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;It remains the most influential sociological study of the topic, spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988–2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's ''Der Zivilisationsprozeß: Mythos oder Realität'' (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to a hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of [[political correctness]].  ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25327104.html 40/2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Philosophy of Civilization'' (1923), [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlines two opinions: one purely [[materialism|material]] and the other material and [[ethic]]al. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress".{{page needed|date=October 2014}}

Adjectives like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by [[Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]], and the first use in English is attributed to [[Adam Ferguson]], who in his 1767 ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' wrote, &lt;!-- Keep original spelling please. --&gt;"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".&lt;ref name=Benveniste&gt;Cited after [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Civilisation. Contribution à l'histoire du mot'' (''Civilisation. Contribution to the history of the word''), 1954, published in ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], 1966, pp. 336–345 (translated by Mary Elizabeth Meek as ''Problems in general linguistics'', 2 vols., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of [[Progress (history)|progress]] characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the [[French Revolution]], "civilization" was used in the [[Grammatical number|singular]], never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French.&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the title ''A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event. To which is subjoined a short account of the natives of Madagascar, with suggestions as to their civilizations'' by J. Hatchard, L.B. Seeley and T. Hamilton, London, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning [[culture]] (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of [[ethnography]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Civilization" (1974), ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 15th ed. Vol. II, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 956. Retrieved 25 August 2007. Using the terms "civilization" and "culture" as equivalents is controversial{{clarify|date=October 2014}} and generally rejected, so that for example some types of culture are not normally described as civilizations.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.

Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of [[Rousseau]], particularly his work about education, ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. Here, civilization, being more [[Reason|rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accord with [[human nature]], and "human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity" (see [[noble savage]]). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]" (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Grün - The End of Dinner.jpg|thumb|The emergence of [[table manners]] and other forms of [[etiquette]] and [[self-restraint]] are presented as one of the characteristics of ''civilized'' society by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939). ''The End of Dinner'' by [[Jules-Alexandre Grün]] (1913).]]
Social scientists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Childe, V., ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin, 1942) and ''Man Makes Himself'' (Harmondsworth, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of [[livelihood]], [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns, [[forms of government]], [[social stratification]], economic systems, [[literacy]] and other cultural traits. [[Andrew Nikiforuk]] argues that "civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Energy of Slaves: Oil and the new servitude |last=Nikiforuk |first=Andrew |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=85 | title= The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher= The Hall of Ma'at |format= |website= | accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=978-0-8465-4800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Hadjikoumis; Angelos, Robinson; and Sarah Viner-Daniels (Eds) (2011), "Dynamics of Neolithisation in Europe: Studies in honour of Andrew Sherratt" (Oxbow Books)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because grain can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[soldiers]], [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= Göbekli Tepe |publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=|date = June 2011|last= Mann|first = Charles C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word "civilization" is sometimes simply defined as "'''living in cities''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Standage]] (2005), ''A History of the World in 6 Glasses'', Walker &amp; Company, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.

Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Grinin, Leonid E (Ed) et al. (2004), "The Early State and its Alternatives and Analogues" (Ichitel)&lt;/ref&gt; State societies are more stratified&lt;ref&gt;Bondarenko, Dmitri et al. (2004), "Alternatives to Social Evolution" in Grinin op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The [[ruling class]], normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a [[Forms of government|government]] or [[bureaucracy]]. [[Morton Fried]], a [[conflict theory|conflict theorist]] and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and [[social inequality]]. This system of classification contains four categories&lt;ref&gt;Bogucki, Peter (1999), "The Origins of Human Society" (Wiley Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[horticulture|Horticultural]]/[[Pastoralism|pastoral]] societies'' in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.
* ''Highly stratified structures'', or [[chiefdom]]s, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave.

Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[Market (economics)|market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a [[gift economy]] supplemented by limited [[barter]] systems. By the early [[Iron Age]], contemporary civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.

[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians|last=Pauketat|first=Timothy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521520669|location=|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the [[Inca]] civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the "Quipus", whose still functioned as a civilized society.

[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher and scientist [[Aristotle]]]]
Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].

Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some "[[primitive culture|primitive]]", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. "Primitive" implies in some way that a culture is "first" (Latin = ''primus''), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term "[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]" to describe these peoples.

Civilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.

Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its [[division of labor|division of labour]], and the carrying capacity of its [[urbanism|urban centres]]. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and [[tort]]-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, [[metallurgy]], political structures and organized religion.

Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as "civilized" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence&amp;nbsp;– calling the latter [[barbarians]], [[wikt:savages|savages]], and [[primitive culture|primitives]]. In a modern-day context, "civilized people" have been contrasted with [[indigenous people]] or [[tribal societies]].

== Cultural identity ==

&lt;!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of Arabia]] comment to remove redlinked img--&gt;
"Civilization" can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a [[state (polity)|state]]-based [[decision making]] apparatus, a [[literature]], professional [[art]], [[architecture]], organized [[religion]] and complex customs of [[education]], [[coercion]] and control associated with maintaining the elite.

[[File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png|thumb|upright=2.0|A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]]]

The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.

Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919"&gt;Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; uses the German word ''Kultur'', "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable".&lt;ref name="Spengler, Oswald 1919" /&gt;

This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] defines civilization as "the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416561248 |page=43 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex systems ==
Another group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]] and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]], India and China, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. During the [[Uruk period]], Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization'' (Second Edition, 2004) ({{ISBN|978-0-226-01382-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Resin found later in the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single "[[world-system theory|world system]]", a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. [[David Wilkinson (political scientist)|David Wilkinson]] has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central Civilization" around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/view/12262/12162|title=Central Civilization|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|author-link1=David Wilkinson (political scientist)|journal=[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]|volume=17|issue=|date=Fall 1987|pages=31–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since [[Ancient history|ancient times]], and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The notion of [[world history]] as a succession of "civilizations" is an entirely modern one.
In the European [[Age of Discovery]], emerging [[Modernity]] was put into stark contrast with the
[[Neolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]  stage of the cultures of the [[New World]], suggesting
that the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;
"Explicit theories of the origin of the state are relatively modern [...] the age of exploration, by making Europeans aware that many peoples throughout the world lived, not in states, but in independent villages or tribes, made the state seem less natural, and thus more in need of explanation."
{{cite web |url=http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |title=A Theory of the Origin of the State |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530140606/http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;
The term "civilization" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around roughly 3000 BC.
[[Gordon Childe]] defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]].

===Urban Revolution===
{{Main article|Neolithic|Bronze Age|Cradle of Civilization}}
At first, the [[Neolithic]] was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.
This encouraged a [[secondary products revolution]] in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts&amp;nbsp;– a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.

The earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at [[Göbekli Tepe]], from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze]] basins in China (for example the [[Pengtoushan]] culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.
[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in [[History of the world|human history]] including the invention of the [[wheel]], the development of [[cuneiform]] script, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[agriculture]]."&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-13.html|title=Iraq, past, present and future: a thoroughly-modern mandate?|last=Milton-Edwards|first=Beverley|date=May 2003|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern [[South America]] (the [[Norte Chico civilization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Haas |first=Jonathan |last2=Creamer |first2=Winifred |last3=Ruiz |first3=Alvaro |date=December 2004 |title=Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru |url= |journal=Nature |language=En |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1020–1023 |doi=10.1038/nature03146 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=15616561}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, Douglas J.; Winterhalder, Bruce (2006).

The [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event]] and the [[5.9 kiloyear event|5.9 Kiloyear]] [[Pluvial|Interpluvial]] saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.&lt;ref&gt;De Meo, James (2nd Edition), "Saharasia"&lt;/ref&gt;  This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of [[endemic warfare|endemic violence]] between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.

[[File:Lascar Avenue of the Dead and the Pyramid of the Sun in the background (4566574277).jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Mesoamerica]]n city [[Teotihuacan]]]]
This "[[urban revolution]]" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;"Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies" op cit{{huh|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of [[sedentism]], the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated [[economies of scale]] and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors.  The transition from ''complex cultures'' to ''civilizations'', while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class&lt;ref&gt;Carniero, R.L. (Ed) (1967), "The Evolution of Society: Selections from Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology", (Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1967), pp. 32–47, 63–96, 153–165.&lt;/ref&gt; who practised human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Joseph |last1 = Watts|first2 =Oliver|last2 = Sheehan|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Joseph|last4 = Bulbulia|first5 = Russell D.|last5= Gray|title = Ritual human sacrifice promoted and sustained the evolution of stratified societies|journal =Nature |volume = 532|issue = 532|pages = 228–231|date = 4 April 2016|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v532/n7598/full/nature17159.html |doi = 10.1038/nature17159|pmid = 27042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist [[Chalcolithic]] civilizations began to rise in various [[Cradle of civilisation|"cradles"]] from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale [[empire]]s in the course of the Bronze Age ([[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyrian Empire]], [[Old Assyrian Empire]], [[Hittite Empire]]).

A parallel development took place independently in the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], where the [[Mayan civilization|Mayans]] began to be [[Maya city|urbanised]] around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.

=== Axial Age ===
{{Main article|Axial Age}}
{{further|Iron Age|Hinduism|Christianization|Spread of Buddhism|Spread of Islam}}
The [[Bronze Age collapse]] was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which  [[Karl Jaspers]] termed the [[Axial Age]], presented as a critical transitional phase leading to [[Classical antiquity|classical civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard (1993). ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View'' (Ballantine Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Hardy McNeill]] proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the "closure of the [[oecumene]]" and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other [[world systems theory|world systems theorists]].

== Fall of civilizations ==
{{prose|section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main article|Societal collapse}}
Civilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Arnold (1965) "A Study of History" (OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.
* [[Ibn Khaldūn]]'s ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Campanini (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5DoasQxzvNQC&amp;pg=PA75 ''Studies on Ibn Khaldûn''], Polimetrica s.a.s., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|[[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]] played an important role in the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].]] 
* [[Edward Gibbon]]'s work ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J. B. Bury (London, 1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174. Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis. Part VI. General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theodor Mommsen]] in his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth", "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
* [[Oswald Spengler]], in his ''[[Decline of the West]]'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].
* [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in his ''[[A Study of History]]'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural [[elite]] became a [[parasitic]] elite, leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.
* [[Joseph Tainter]] in ''[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.
* [[Jared Diamond]] in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.
* [[Peter Turchin]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830212141/http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' in their [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121–127; [[Andrey Korotayev]] et al. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=302&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, 2006]).
* [[Peter Heather]] argues in his book ''[[Decline of the Roman Empire#Peter Heather|The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Heather|title=The Fall Of The Roman Empire: A New History Of Rome And The Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCOJfTB7HtgC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=1 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and others.
* [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]], in his book ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Ward-Perkins|title=The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vSUh9KbfKAC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280728-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.
* [[Arthur Demarest]] argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-521-53390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
* Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society".&lt;ref&gt;McNeely, Jeffrey A. (1994) "Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity" (Vol 3, No 1 1994. Biodiversity and Conservation)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in [http://www.theupsideofdown.com/ ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization''], where he considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.
* [[Feliks Koneczny]] in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations"  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a "biological" life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese&amp;nbsp;– which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social life" upon the other.&lt;ref&gt;Koneczny, Feliks (1962) On the Plurality of Civilizations, Posthumous English translation by Polonica Publications, London {{ASIN|B0000CLABJ}}. Originally published in Polish, O Wielości Cywilizacyj, Gebethner &amp; Wolff, Kraków 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Absorbing alien "method of organizing social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition.

Political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P., ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;, has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a [[clash of civilizations]]. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between [[nation-state]]s and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like [[Edward Said]], Muhammed Asadi and [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |title=A Critique of Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" |last=Asadi |first=Muhammed |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=Selves and Others |accessdate=23 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042806/http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html |archivedate=26 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Pippa Norris]] have argued that the "true clash of civilizations" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/0304clash.htm|title=The True Clash of Civilizations|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|author2=Pippa Norris|date=March–April 2003|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Identity and Violence'' Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed "civilization", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.

Cultural Historian [[Morris Berman]] suggests in ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Morris (2007), ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' (W.W. Norton)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, [[Jane Jacobs]] who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jane (2005), ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Vintage)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental scientists also see the world entering a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html Orion Thoughts on America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112558/http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html |date=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml Kosmos Journal Paths to Planetary Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712162009/http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml |date=12 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the [[Global scenario group]] used [[scenario analysis]] to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented [[Eco-Communalism]] movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new [[sustainability]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf GTinitiative.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814021505/http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf |date=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural critic]] and author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 &amp; Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities", with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), "Endgame: The Problem of Civilization", Vol 1 (Seven Stories Press), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.

The [[Kardashev scale]] classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist (see also: [[Civilizations and the Future]] and [[Space civilization]]).

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
A '''classic''' is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of [[Masterpiece|lasting worth]] or with a timeless quality; of the first or [[Literary merit|highest quality]], class, or rank&lt;ref name="dref" /&gt; &amp;ndash; something that [[Exemplification|exemplifies]] its [[Class (philosophy)|class]]. The word can be an [[adjective]] (a ''classic'' car) or a [[noun]] (a ''classic'' of English literature). It denotes a particular quality in art, architecture, literature, design, technology, or other cultural artifacts. In commerce, products are named 'classic' to denote a long-standing popular version or model, to distinguish it from a newer variety. ''Classic'' is used to describe many major, long-standing sporting events. Colloquially, an everyday occurrence (e.g. a joke or mishap) may be described in some dialects of English as 'an absolute classic'.

"Classic" should not be confused with ''classical'', which refers specifically to certain cultural styles, especially in [[Classical music|music]] and [[Classical architecture|architecture]]: styles generally taking inspiration from the [[Classical tradition]], hence [[classicism]].

==The Classics==
{{main article|Classics}}
The [[classics]] are the literature of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], known as [[classical antiquity]], and once the principal subject studied in the [[humanities]].  Classics (without the definite article) can refer to the study of philosophy, literature, history and the arts of the ancient world, as in "reading classics at Cambridge". From that usage came the more general concept of 'classic'.&lt;ref name="dref"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classic] Definition of classic at dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese classics]] occupy a similar position in [[Chinese culture]], and various other cultures have their own classics.

==Cultural classics==
Books, films and music particularly may become ''a classic'' but a painting would more likely be called a [[masterpiece]]. A classic is often something old that is still popular.

The first known use of "classic" in this sense — a work so excellent that it is on the level of the "classics" (Greek and Latin authors) — is by the 18th-century scholar [[John Bowle (writer)|Rev. John Bowle]]. He applied the term to ''[[Don Quixote]]'', of which Bowle prepared an innovative edition, such as he judged that a classic work needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article
|title=A letter to the Reverend Dr. Percy : concerning a new and classical edition of Historia del valeroso cavallero Don Quixote de la Mancha
|first=John
|last=Bowle
|authorlink=John Bowle (writer)
|location=London
|year=2001
|volume=21
|number=1
|pages=95–146
|journal=Cervantes (journal of the [[Cervantes Society of America]])
|url=https://www.h-net.org/~cervantes/csa/artics01/bowle2.pdf
|quote=First edition 1777.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples would be the book ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' by [[Mark Twain]], the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and the song [[Heartbreak Hotel]] by [[Elvis Presley]]. Lists of classics are long and wide-ranging,{{cn|date=November 2018}} and would vary depending on personal opinion. [[Classic rock]] is a popular radio format, playing a repertoire of old but familiar recordings.

A contemporary work may be hailed as an ''instant classic'', but the criteria for classic status tends to include the test of time. The term "classic" is in fact often generalized to refer to any work of a certain age, regardless of whether it is any good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cult classic]] may be well known but is only favored by a minority.

==Science and technology==
A well known and reliable procedure, such as a demonstration of well-established scientific principle, may be described as classic: e.g. the [[cartesian diver]] experiment.

==Consumer artifacts==
Manufacturers frequently describe their products as classic, to distinguish the original from a new variety, or to imply qualities in the product – although the [[Ford Consul Classic]], a car manufactured 1961–1963, has the "classic" tag for no apparent reason. The [[iPod classic]] was simply called the iPod until the sixth generation, when ''classic'' was added to the name because other designs were also available – an example of a [[retronym]]. ''Coca-Cola Classic'' is the name used for the relaunch of [[Coca-Cola]] after the failure of the [[New Coke]] recipe change. Similarly, the [[Classic (transit bus)]], a transit bus manufactured from 1982–97, succeeded an unpopular futuristic design.

A classic can be something old that remains prized or valuable (but not an [[antique]]). [[Classic car]]s, for example, are recognised by various collectors' organisations such as the [[Classic Car Club of America]], who regulate the qualifying attributes that constitute classic status.

==Sport==
Many sporting events take the name ''classic'':

*Horse races, e.g. [[British Classic Races]]
*Snooker tournaments e.g. the [[Wuxi Classic]]
*College Basketball e.g. the [[Charleston Classic]]
*Major League Baseball All-Star Game e.g. the [[Midsummer Classic]]
*[[World Baseball Classic]]
*National Hockey League, the [[Winter Classic]].
*Cycling, the [[Classic cycle races]]

In Spanish-speaking countries, the term "Clásico" refers to a match between two [[Association football|football]] teams known as traditional rivals, e.g. [[El Clásico]] in Spain.&lt;sup&gt;rr&lt;/sup&gt;

The '''Clay-body''', '''clay corpse''', or ''Corp criadhach'' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]) might be said to be an indigenous [[Scotland|Scottish]] variant of the more famous [[voodoo doll]].

Supposedly, when a [[witch]] wanted to destroy anyone to whom she had an ill will, she often made a “corpse” of [[clay]] resembling the unfortunate one, and placed it in some out-of-the-way stream under a precipice or waterfall, in such a way that the water trickled slowly on it. As the clay-body wasted, so the live body of the person it resembled was also supposed to waste away. Were the clay-body found, it was carefully preserved, and so the spell of the witch was broken. Sometimes pins were stuck in the clay body to make the death of the doomed one more painful. Several such bodies have been found, even around the turn of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments. 

== Overview ==
Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

== Examples ==
Examples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:
* [[Bill Cosby]]'s daughters&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/obama-cultural-mulatto_b_41576.html|title = Obama: Cultural Mulatto|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Real African people working on their little farm in Freetown.jpg|thumb|Traveler from [[Australia]] visiting a small farm in [[Sierra Leone]].]]
'''Culture shock''' is an experience a person may have when one moves to a cultural environment which is different from one's own; it is also the personal disorientation a person may feel when experiencing an unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a visit to a new country, a move between social environments, or simply transition to another type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John, and Linda Gerber. "Chapter 3 - Culture." Sociology. 7th edition ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Canada Inc., 2010. 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common causes of culture shock involves individuals in a foreign environment. Culture shock can be described as consisting of at least one of four distinct phases: [[honeymoon]], negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation. 

Common problems include: [[information overload]], [[language barrier]], [[generation gap]], [[technology gap]], skill interdependence, formulation dependency, [[homesickness]] (cultural), boredom (job dependency), response ability [[Cross-cultural capital|(cultural skill set)]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, Paul. The Five Stages of Culture Shock: Critical Incidents Around the World. Contributions in psychology, no. 25. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no true way to entirely prevent culture shock, as individuals in any society are personally affected by cultural contrasts differently.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, LaRay M. "HOW CULTURE SHOCK AFFECTS COMMUNICATION." Communication 5.1 (n.d.): 1-18. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO.29 Sept.2009.web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four phases==

=== Honeymoon ===
During this period, the differences between the old and new culture are seen in a romantic light. For example, in moving to a new country, an individual might love the new food, the pace of life, and the locals' habits. During the first few weeks, most people are fascinated by the new culture. They associate with nationals who speak their language, and who are polite to the foreigners. Like most [[honeymoon]] periods, this stage eventually ends.&lt;ref&gt;Oberg, Dr. Kalervo. "Culture Shock and the problem of Adjustment to the new cultural environments". World Wide Classroom Consortium for International Education &amp; Multicultural studies. 29 Sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation===
After some time (usually around three months, depending on the individual), differences between the old and new culture become apparent and may create [[anxiety]]. Excitement may eventually give way to unpleasant feelings of frustration and anger as one continues to experience unfavorable events that may be perceived as strange and offensive to one's cultural attitude. Language barriers, stark differences in public hygiene, traffic safety, food accessibility and quality may heighten the sense of disconnection from the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrides, Gregory PhD “Culture Shock and Clinical Depression.” Foreign Teachers Guide to Living and Working in China. Middle Kingdom Life, 2009. Web. 29 Sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being transferred into a different environment puts special pressure on communication skills, there are practical difficulties to overcome, such as [[circadian rhythm]] disruption that often leads to [[insomnia]] and daylight drowsiness; adaptation of [[gut flora]] to different [[bacteria]] levels and concentrations in food and water; difficulty in seeking treatment for illness, as medicines may have different names from the native country's and the same [[active ingredient]]s might be hard to recognize.

Still, the most important change in the period is communication: People adjusting to a new culture often feel [[Loneliness|lonely]] and homesick because they are not yet used to the new environment and meet people with whom they are not familiar every day. The language barrier may become a major obstacle in creating new relationships: special attention must be paid to one's and others' culture-specific [[body language]] signs, linguistic faux pas, conversation tone, linguistic nuances and customs, and [[false friends]]. 

In the case of students studying abroad, some develop additional symptoms of loneliness that ultimately affect their lifestyles as a whole. Due to the strain of living in a different country without parental support, international students often feel anxious and feel more pressure while adjusting to new cultures—even more so when the cultural distances are wide, as patterns of [[logic]] and [[speech]] are different and a special emphasis is put on [[rhetoric]].

=== Adjustment ===
Again, after some time (usually 6 to 12 months), one grows accustomed to the new culture and develops routines. One knows what to expect in most situations and the host country no longer feels all that new. One becomes concerned with basic living again, and things become more "normal". One starts to develop problem-solving skills for dealing with the culture and begins to accept the culture's ways with a [[Optimism|positive attitude]]. The culture begins to make sense, and negative reactions and responses to the culture are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewanderlanders.com/the-four-stages-of-adjusting-to-a-new-culture/|title=Adjust To New Cultures Like A Pro|first=|last=Sarah|date=25 May 2016|website=thewanderlanders.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
In the mastery stage individuals are able to participate fully and comfortably in the host culture. Mastery does not mean total conversion; people often keep many traits from their earlier culture, such as accents and languages. It is often referred to as the [[Bicultural identity|bicultural]] stage.

==Reverse culture shock==
'''Reverse culture shock''' (also known as "re-entry shock" or "own culture shock"&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Woesler]], A new model of intercultural communication – critically reviewing, combining and further developing the basic models of Permutter, Yoshikawa, Hall, [[Geert Hofstede]], Thomas, Hallpike, and the social-constructivism, Bochum/Berlin 2009, book series Comparative Cultural Sciences vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;) may take place—returning to one's home culture after growing accustomed to a new one can produce the same effects as described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161104-how-expats-cope-with-losing-their-identity |title=How expats cope with losing their identity |last=Clarke |first=Laura |date=6 November 2016 |website=BBC Capital |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130611-returning-expat-culture-shock|title=Expat culture shock boomerangs in the office|last=Garone|first=Elizabeth|date=3 November 2014|website=BBC Capital |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are results from the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] and psychological consequences of the readjustment process to the primary culture.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Jennifer L. "Parental attachment, reverse culture shock, perceived social support, and college adjustment of missionary children." Journal of Psychology &amp; Theology 29.3 (2001): 246-264.29 Sept 2009.Web&lt;/ref&gt; The affected person often finds this more surprising and difficult to deal with than the original culture shock.  This phenomenon, the reactions that members of the re-entered culture exhibit toward the re-entrant, and the inevitability of the two are encapsulated in the following saying, which is also the title of a book by [[Thomas Wolfe]], ''[[You Can't Go Home Again]]''.

Reverse culture shock is generally made up of two parts: idealization and expectations. When an extended period of time is spent abroad we focus on the good from our past, cut out the bad, and create an idealized version of the past. Secondly, once removed from our familiar setting and placed in a foreign one we incorrectly assume that our previous world has not changed.  We expect things to remain exactly the same as when we left them. The realization that life back home is now different, that the world has continued without us, and the process of readjusting to these new conditions as well as actualizing our new perceptions about the world with our old way of living causes discomfort and psychological anguish. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Hank "Dealing with Reverse Culture Shock." Breaking Trail Online. http://brktrail.com/rshock/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
There are three basic outcomes of the Adjustment Phase:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winkelman|first1=Michael|title=Cultural Shock and Adaptation|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|date=1994|volume=73|issue=2|pages=121-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people find it impossible to accept the foreign culture and to [[Social integration|integrate]]. They isolate themselves from the host country's environment, which they come to perceive as hostile, withdraw into an (often mental) "[[ghetto]]" and see return to their own culture as the only way out. These "Rejectors" also have the greatest problems re-integrating back home after return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winant|first1=Howard|title=The World Is A Ghetto|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-04341-0|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people integrate fully and take on all parts of the host culture while losing their original identity. This is called [[cultural assimilation]]. They normally remain in the host country forever. This group is sometimes known as "Adopters" and describes approximately 10% of expatriates.
* Some people manage to adapt to the aspects of the host culture they see as positive, while keeping some of their own and creating their unique blend. They have no major problems returning home or relocating elsewhere. This group can be thought to be [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]. Approximately 30% of expats belong to this group.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Transition shock==
Culture shock is a subcategory of a more universal construct called transition shock. Transition shock is a state of loss and disorientation predicated by a change in one's familiar environment that requires adjustment. There are many symptoms of transition shock, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CESA|title=Dealing with culture shock|website=Management Entity: Office of International Research, Education, and Development|accessdate= 29 September 2009|url=http://www.oired.vt.edu/cesa/currentstudents/cs_culturalshock.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dematerialization of the art object''' is an idea in [[conceptual art]].  In "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [[Lucy Lippard]] characterizes the period of 1966 to 1972 as one in which the [[art object]] was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Blocker]] ''What the Body Cost''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falata Umbroro''' (the transhumance pastoralists) originally came from western Africa and settled in the [[Blue Nile]] in the beginning of the 1950s. They were permitted by the indigenous tribes to use the natural resources.

The Falata-Umbroro actually consist several ethnic groups which have their own local language, religion and native homeland. Originally from Western African countries, including Mali, Mauritania, Cameroon and Nigeria. Falata herders breed a species of cow that is known for its big horns, brown skin and tough hide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Mey Eltayeb|title=Blue Nile: National and indigenous conflict management – competing or complementary systems?|journal=New Routes|date=2012|issue=2|pages=22–25|url=http://www.life-peace.org/wp-content/uploads/nr_2012_2.22-25.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of China |expanded = Leadership }}

Since both the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] promote according to seniority, it is possible to discern distinct '''generations of Chinese leadership'''.&lt;ref&gt;The landmark study of military generations and factions is William Whitson's ''The Chinese High Command,'' Praeger, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In official discourse, each group of leadership is identified with a distinct extension of the ideology of the party. Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] by reference to these "generations".

==Terminology==
While in English the chronological leadership groups are commonly referred to as "generations of Chinese leadership", there is no exact equivalent expression in Chinese. The usual term in official discourse for such a group is a "leadership collective", which are counted in generations. Thus, for example, the "first generation" of leaders identified below are labelled as "the first generation leadership collective". In official discourse, they are also not viewed as leaders of the ''state'' (the [[People's Republic of China]]), but rather leaders of the ''party'' (the [[Communist Party of China]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. {{cite web |url= http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/17039979.html|title= Formation of the First Generation Central Leadership Collective - and also on how Mao Zedong's core status was determined (第一代中央领导集体形成——兼谈毛泽东核心地位怎样确立)|last1= Liao (廖)|first1= Xinwen (心文)|last2= |first2= |date= 2012-02-07|work= Communist Party of China News|publisher= People.com.cn|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Communist Party's official discourse, the "generational" division and identification of the "[[Leadership core|core leader]]" for each of the first, second and third generations was set down during the leadership of [[Jiang Zemin]] and first publicised in 1999. This division and identification was not uncontroversial at the time, since the party had hitherto regarded his immediate predecessors as the party's [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], [[Hu Yaobang]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], as its leaders, and regarded [[Deng Xiaoping]] as the "power behind the throne" rather than a formal leader. The revision of party history into "generations" helped to secure Jiang's position as "core" and anointed heir. Through the invention of the concept of the "core", it also helped to de-legitimise Jiang's deposed predecessors (such as Hu and Zhao), by relegating them from party leader to mere "membership" of a "leadership collective", which also conveniently helped to legitimise their deposition.

Jiang's successors have maintained this generational division, but have retreated from identifying a "core leader" in the fourth generation, and the succeeding general secretary [[Hu Jintao]] has never been identified in official announcements as the "core" of the fourth generation, preferring to be simply called by his title "General Secretary". [[Xi Jinping]] did continue this practice until October 2016 when the 6th Plenary of the 18th Central Committee named him as the "core leader" in a document.&lt;ref&gt;Chen Heying.[http://epaper.globaltimes.cn/2016-10-28/P01.htm 6th plenum hails Xi as core leader], in: Global Times, 28. October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The "leadership collective" at any one time usually, but not always, correlates with the members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]], with the leader of the party (the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] or, after 1982, the General Secretary) often, but not always, the leader of this leadership collective.

==First generation==
[[File:1954 chenyun maozedong.jpg|thumb|left|First generation leaders (from left) [[Zhu De]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Chen Yun]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] in [[Zhongnanhai]] in 1954.]]
Although the first generation of leaders ruled collectively for only part of the period, and [[Mao Zedong]] was to a large extent a paramount, autocratic leader for most of the period, the successive leaders from the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 until Mao's death and the dismantling of the power of his closest deputies in 1976 are now referred to retrospectively as the "first generation" of leaders in official discourse.

Thus, the first generation, from 1949 to 1976, consisted of Mao Zedong as core, along with [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Zhu De]] (as informal [[triumvirate]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol16n2/juz016002002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Chen Yun]], [[Peng Dehuai]], and later [[Lin Biao]] and the [[Gang of Four]] (neither Lin nor the Gang are today considered by official discourse to be part of this generation because of political antagonism resulting from the [[Cultural Revolution]]). These were the leaders that founded the [[People's Republic of China]] after the Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. They were born between 1886 and 1907, although the Gang of Four were a distinct subgroup born 1914 to 1935. Most were born before the demise and fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (not including the Gang) and thus lived to see both the birth and, on [[Mainland China|the mainland]], the end of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. One heavy characteristic of these leaders were that they tended to be both political and military leaders.  Most had some education outside [[China]], and their formative experiences included the [[Long March]], [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The guiding political ideology from the first generations were general principles of [[Marxism]] and ''[[Mao Zedong Thought]]''.

Of this group, Mao, Zhou, Zhu and Liu were the four original members of the collective leadership from 1949 until the political turmoil of the late 1950s and early 1960s, which resulted in Mao gaining paramount autocratic power. Liu, then the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] (or "Chairman of the State"), was removed from his party position in 1966, placed under house arrest in 1967, and died from torture and maltreatment in 1969.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Mao, Zhou and Zhu were the only three original members of the [[Historical membership of the Politburo Standing Committee#7th de facto PSC (1945–1956)|Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China]] who remained in the Politburo from 1945 until their deaths in 1976 (though Zhu temporarily lost his membership between 1969-1973) and died while holding the highest party and state offices [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman of the Communist Party]] (Mao), [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] (Zhou) and [[Chairman of the National People's Congress|Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]], the nominal [[List of Presidents of the People's Republic of China|head of state]] (Zhu).

With the demise of Liu, Mao promoted Lin Biao as his deputy, and the "Gang of Four" to fill the role of his trusted henchmen. Lin fell out of favour, however, and died in 1971 while attempting to escape to the [[Soviet Union]]. The Gang of Four, which consisted of [[Jiang Qing]] (Madame Mao), and three other members meteorically promoted in the late 1960s, were the only members of the first generation of leadership to remain after Mao's death in 1976. Their demise came shortly afterwards in a political coup managed by what become the second generation of leaders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Of the other members identified above, Chen Yun was sidelined from the early 1960s, lost his party position in 1969, but survived to play an influential role in the second generation of leadership. Peng Dehuai was denounced in 1959, made a brief return to government in 1965, but was detained by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] from 1966 and died in prison from torture and maltreatment in 1974. While not named above, [[Deng Xiaoping]], the core of the second generation of leadership, also played a key role in the first generation at various times, mainly as an ally of Zhou and Peng, but was purged from government in 1976 and remained sidelined at the time of Mao's death.

==Second generation==

The death of Mao, Zhou and Zhu in 1976, and soon afterwards the coup that resulted in the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], ushered in the era now identified as the "second generation" of leaders. The era began with [[Hua Guofeng]] as the successor to Mao, but his position was soon eclipsed by the ascendancy of [[Deng Xiaoping]] as the paramount leader, in which position he remained at least until 1992 when he resigned from his leadership positions. During this period the most power and influence had a group of old party veterans, known as the [[Eight Elders]], whose main members were [[Li Xiannian]] and [[Chen Yun]], together with Deng. All of them had more than 40 years of political experience.&lt;ref&gt;China's Great Economic Transformation,"These two individuals had a more direct influence on economic policy than did Deng"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in official discourse, the second generation of leadership lasted from 1976 to 1992. The official discourse of the Communist Party today identifies [[Deng Xiaoping]] as the "core" of this second generation, but Deng was never formally the leader of the party during this period. Instead, the formal party leaders during this time were, successively, [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Hu Yaobang]], [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. Other prominent leaders of this generation were [[Chen Yun]], [[Li Xiannian]], [[Ye Jianying]], [[Peng Zhen]] and [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]]. These leaders were also involved in the Chinese revolution, but with the exception of Deng Xiaoping, served in more junior roles, as they were all born from 1897 to 1921 (that is, some were born after the demise of the [[Qing Empire]] in the [[Xinhai Revolution]]). Like the first generation, many were educated overseas, particularly in [[France]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Their young formative experiences were similar to the first generation. Most had some position of authority during the [[Cultural Revolution]], although as a rule those that held power after the 1980s were purged during that decade. This generation turned the focus from class struggle and political movements to economic development and pioneering [[Chinese economic reform]].

The dominant political ideology of the era was [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], which was accepted by the party in 1978, and he served in various leadership positions, although his paramount power was not overtly reflected in his formal titles. Instead, the formal leaders of the party were a series of younger leaders promoted (and then demoted) by Deng and other influential elders. The most prominent of these were [[Hu Yaobang]] (Party Chairman from 1981, General Secretary from 1982, demoted 1987, died 1989), and Zhao Ziyang (Premier from 1980, General Secretary from 1987, demoted and place under house arrest in 1989). They were replaced by [[Li Peng]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], who would go on to become prominent members of the third generation of leaders.

Consistently influential behind the scenes during Deng's time as paramount leader were fellow elder statesmen Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. Other prominent elders were Ye Jianying (until his death in 1986), Deng Yingchao (Zhou Enlai's widow, until her death in 1992) and Peng Zhen (who retired in 1988). [[Yang Shangkun]] played a brief but important role in the period between 1989 and 1992, when as President he subverted the existing constitutional convention and turned the office of President from a symbolic role into an executive one.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The transition towards the third generation of leadership began with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The purges that followed led to the promotion of what became the third generation of leadership. Soon afterwards, Deng resigned his last major party post, as chairman of the central military committee, although he remained influential behind the scenes until his death in 1997.

==Third generation==
Between 1989 and 1992, Jiang was believed to be simply a transitional figure to protect the party from a power vacuum (or even an Eastern Bloc style collapse) until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place. Because of this, the era of the "third generation" is not regarded to have begun until 1992, with the election of the new [[Politburo]] standing committee and Jiang consolidating his power without Deng.

Thus, the "third generation" lasted from 1992 to 2002, with [[Jiang Zemin]] as core, and other leaders including [[Li Peng]], [[Zhu Rongji]], [[Qiao Shi]], [[Li Ruihuan]]. These leaders were born before the revolution from 1924 to 1934 but were educated afterwards before the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Most of them received education in the [[Soviet Union]] as engineers and entered the party initially as factory managers. As a result, many of them did not wield any significant political power prior to the 1980s, spending their time during the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath working for the civil infrastructure of the state and were protected from the purges, as opposed to their predecessors. Unlike their predecessors, there is a split between the political and military leadership. Their formative experiences included the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Korean War]]. This generation continued economic development while China saw the emergence of various serious social issues. The political ideological innovation officially associated with this period was Jiang's "[[Three Represents]]".

The initial members of the third generation were mostly survivors from before 1989, including [[Jiang Zemin]], [[Li Peng]] (who continued as premier), [[Qiao Shi]] and [[Li Ruihuan]]. Notable changes to the leadership were the elevation of [[Zhu Rongji]] in place of [[Li Peng]] as premier in 1998 and the elevation of [[Hu Jintao]] as vice president. For the first time since 1982, the three centres of power of the presidency, the party general secretaryship and the chairmanship of the central military commission were concentrated in a single person, Jiang Zemin. This enabled him to declare himself the "core" of the third generation of leadership.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

During this period, while Deng Xiaoping had retired from all leadership positions, he remained influential. In 1992, Deng's informal intervention ensured that market-orientated reforms were not halted by resurgent conservative elements. Deng also played an important role in nominating [[Hu Jintao]] as Jiang's successor as party secretary.

==Fourth generation==
{{main article|Hu–Wen Administration}}
2002 saw the first orderly transition of power in the Communist Party of China in accordance with rules on term limits. The new leaders were elected to the Communist Party's Politburo in 2002, and took up their governmental positions in 2003, while the most prominent of their "third generation" predecessors stepped down at the same time.

Thus, the era of the "fourth generation" is officially regarded to have begun in 2002, and lasted until 2012, when the next election for the party leadership occurred. The prominent leaders included [[Hu Jintao]] (as [[General Secretary]]), [[Wu Bangguo]], [[Wen Jiabao]], [[Jia Qinglin]], [[Zeng Qinghong]] and [[Li Changchun]]. It is also known as the "republican generation" or the [[Hu-Wen Administration]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} These were promoted to top leadership at the [[16th Party Congress]] and remained in power until the [[18th Party Congress]] in 2012. This generation of leaders, born mainly in the [[World War II]] years from 1939 to 1944, represented a new [[technocratic]] style governance and a less centralized political structure. The majority of this generation of leaders were engineers whose academic lives were disrupted by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and, unlike both their predecessors and likely successors, have spent very little time overseas. The dominant political ideology of this era was Hu's [[Scientific Development Concept]] and a goal for a [[Socialist Harmonious Society]].

==Fifth generation (current)==
{{main article|Xi–Li Administration}}
The fifth generation came to power at the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th Party Congress]] in 2012, when [[Hu Jintao]] stepped down as Party [[General Secretary]]. In the fifth generation, one sees fewer engineers and more management and finance majors, including successful entrepreneurs. Most of the fifth generation of civilian leadership, born in the [[postwar]] years 1945 to 1955, were educated at top Chinese universities. Hu Jintao's [[Communist Youth League]] faction, and the [[Crown Prince Party]] (or "Princelings") are seen to be the two dominant factions within the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willy Lam|Willy Wo-Lap Lam]]. [http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/31/china.fifth/ China's 5th generation comes of age], [[CNN]], January 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arpi, Claude (October 18, 2010). [http://sify.com/news/why-beijing-seethes-over-the-nobel-for-liu-news-columns-kksoVnciihi.html "Why Beijing seethes over the Nobel for Liu"], Sify&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his elevation to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], which oversees the [[People's Liberation Army]], the Princeling and current General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]] succeeded Hu Jintao as the [[paramount leader]] of this generation.&lt;ref name="demick"&gt;{{cite web|last=Demick|first=Barbara |date=19 October 2010|title=Xi Jinping on track to become China's next president|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-xi-20101019,0,604801.story|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Li Keqiang]] took the place of former Premier [[Wen Jiabao]]. Other prominent figures that are top figures in the 5th generation as it develops include Congress Chairmen [[Zhang Dejiang]] and [[Li Zhanshu]], Conference Chairmen [[Yu Zhengsheng]] and [[Wang Yang (official)|Wang Yang]], Secretariat Secretaries [[Liu Yunshan]] and [[Wang Huning]], Vice President and former Discipline Secretary [[Wang Qishan]], first Vice Premiers [[Zhang Gaoli]] and [[Han Zheng]], former Vice President [[Li Yuanchao]], and its leading females, former Vice Premier [[Liu Yandong]] and current Vice Premier [[Sun Chunlan]].

==Sixth generation==
The sixth generation of leaders has been expected to come to power at the 20th Party Congress in 2022. Under current unspoken Chinese political conventions the leaders of this generation would be mostly born in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/Vol2No1_BoZhiyue.pdf |title=eai.nus.edu |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006004033/http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/Vol2No1_BoZhiyue.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and speculated future leaders were born from 1960 to 1967. Current speculation places former [[Communist Youth League]] head and current [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|3rd-ranked Vice Premier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/world/asia/a-rising-party-leader-in-china-is-elevated-yet-again.html |title=China: A Rising Party Leader Is Elevated Yet Again |publisher=The New York Times |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hu Chunhua]] as a possible core figure. Hu and [[Sun Zhengcai]] were the only Politburo members named at the 18th Party Congress in 2012 who were born after 1960, making their further advancement an apparent certainty, but Sun was purged before the 19th Party Congress. U.S.-based newspaper ''[[Duo Wei Times]]'' also listed [[Fujian]] Governor [[Su Shulin]] (since then fallen from grace), President of the [[Supreme People's Court]] [[Zhou Qiang]], Heilongjiang Party Secretary [[Zhang Qingwei]], and [[Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Natural Resources]] [[Lu Hao (born 1967)|Lu Hao]] as other potential figures in this generation of leadership.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Feng|title=中国政坛"第六代新星"开始崭露头角|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2011-03-23/57531330.html|accessdate=2011-03-23|newspaper=Duowei|date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in this rough age group ascending in the ranks include  [[Zhang Guoqing]] ([[Mayor of Tianjin]]) and  [[Chen Min'er]] ([[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo member]]).

Following Xi Jinping's consolidation of power at the [[19th Party Congress]], the future of the sixth generation was cast into doubt as clear successor figures failed to be named to senior leadership posts, particularly the [[Politburo Standing Committee]].&lt;ref name="Nikkei"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nakazawa|first1=Katsuji|title=Only Wang Qishan knew what Xi Jinping was going to do|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Features/China-up-close/Only-Wang-Qishan-knew-what-Xi-Jinping-was-going-to-do?page=2|accessdate=26 March 2018|work=[[Nikkei Asian Review]]|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The villages of '''Großwilsdorf''' and the Rödel Plateau are situated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the middle of [[Germany]].  It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts (Deutsch-Slawische Forschungen zur Namenkunde und Siedlungsgeschichte 26).|date=1971|publisher=Berlin|language=German|trans-title=The history of names in the settlement in the area of the Saale and the Elbeuntil the end of the 9th century (German-Slav research on the history of names and settlements 26).|author=Walter, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sandstone,_Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">'''Hayandose''' is a cultural category used to express membership and belonging among Zapotec migrants, described by cultural anthropologist [[Lourdes Gutiérrez-Nájera]]. Hayandose entails a process of creating ethnically-marked spaces among migrants in an effort to combat feelings of [[marginalization]] and [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] in a host country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gutiérrez-Nájera, Lourdes. “Hayandose”, in ''Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America''. Ed. Peréz,Gina M., Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be compared to the notion of Native Hubs developed by anthropologist Renya Ramirez to describe how urban Native Americans negotiate a transnational existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramirez|first=Renya|title=Native Hubs: Culture, Community, and Belonging in Silicon Valley and Beyond|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press Books|isbn=0822340305|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Beyond el Barrio ==
“Hayandose”, in ''Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America'',&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Peréz,Gina M., Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; examines the place of indigenous people within the broader scope of Latino Studies and also within the national political landscape. As argued in the text, indigenous subjects do not easily fit the category of "Latino" used to describe national identities; for example, Guatemalan, Mexican, Ecuadorian. At the same time, indigenous migrants often are targets of racism and prejudice directed towards them. The essay is in conversation with other essays in the volume that interrogate the ways that Latinos carve out niches for themselves and thrive in urban spaces within the United States. As the essay Hayandose argues, such established spaces allow migrants, struggling with separation from their home country and racist stigmatization in their host country, to engage in a “meaningful practice of belonging” in which they are able to express their cultural membership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Hayandose marks the point at which people finally feel as though they belong through the discovery of themselves in a foreign place.

== Zapotecs/Gutiérrez-Nájera ==
Gutiérrez-Nájera uses [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] as an example of migrants who originate from [[Oaxaca]], [[México]] and form their own spaces of belonging in the [[United States]], specifically in [[Los Angeles]]. The Zapotecs that Gutiérrez-Najera writes about are from Yalálag, a small rural town in the heart of Oaxaca. The community of Yalaltecos in Los Angeles comes together collectively and participates in festivals, ceremonies, ''tandas'' and other small gatherings where they can gossip in Zapotec, share food, dance, financially and emotionally support one another, and engage in other [[customs]] and [[traditions]] from their place of origin. The existence and practice of customs and traditions that were once thought to be exclusive to Yalálag, but that have now permeated American society, demonstrates the [[International|transnational]] character of Yalaltecos [[indigeneity]] that makes possible the process of Hayandose through the seizure and declaration of these ethnically-marked spaces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles have invoked their [[cultural identity]] hundreds of miles from home and have used it as a tool to resist the push for [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and marginalization within the United States. Therefore, the transmission and continuity of [[culture]] across national borders are essential for Yalaltecos to mark their own space and ultimately find themselves in a hostile environment far from their home country. With this new-found sense of belonging, the opportunity for “rally[ing] for indigenous rights and the development of hometown communities in Oaxaca, as well as to organize in the United States around immigrant legislation” no longer remains out of reach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This claim is reaffirmed by another scholar, Annice Jacoby, who argues that the affirmation of transnational identities allows “borders of ownership, space, and social agency” to be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Annice. "With and Without Permission: Mission Muralismo", in ''Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo''. Ed. Jacoby, Annice. New York: Abrams, 2009. 29-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a migrant ''se hayan'', or finds themselves, they have gained a sense of belonging by affirming their cultural membership and confronting their marginalization and displacement within a space collectively or individually marked as their own in the host country. This phenomenon then acts as a bridge for migrants to gain social ascendancy and acknowledgment that has the potential to improve lives in the home and host country alike.

== De/territorialization ==
Hayandose is also reflective of a contemporary cultural process known as de/territorialization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Inda, Johnathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. "Introduction: A World in Motion", in ''The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader''. Ed. Inda, J.X. and R. Rosaldo. Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2002. 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[emigrants]] moved to the United States they and their culture became deterritorialized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Once they moved, however, they are simultaneously reterritorialized as they begin to form a space for themselves and practice their customs and traditions as they did in their home country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The theory of de/territorialization can be seen in the Yalalteco community in Los Angeles through the perseverance of their cultural solidarity from Oaxaca to California, and the maintenance of community ties that traverse national boundaries. The theories of de/territorialization and Hayandose entail the movement of culture from one place to another, and thus reveal the “multiple centers” culture can obtain, as opposed to just a single "center" being the place of origin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Because [[human migration|migration]] causes displacement among emigrants who are forced to adapt to a new environment, culture, and way of living, bringing the culture and customs that they practiced in their places of origin to their new location helps to combat these negative feelings and also adds an additional “center” to their particular culture. In regards to Gutiérrez-Nájera’s example, Yalaltecos adopted Los Angeles as an additional “center” where their customs and traditions could be expressed as they would have been in Yalálag. This sharing of cultures creates a cultural flow between the United States and Oaxacan communities that have allowed emigrants not to lose their culture and sense of who they are, but to maintain it and ultimately use it as a powerful tool to engage in practices of belonging that resist sentiments of marginalization and displacement in new locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8312">The '''history of mentalities''' is a [[calque]] of the [[French language|French]] term ''histoire des mentalités'', which might also be translated as "[[history]] of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s", "[[mindset]]s" or "[[world-view]]s". The term describes a particular manner of researching history. This approach is associated with the "critical turn" (''tournant critique'') taken by the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]], particularly around the 1960s.

In keeping with the ''Annales''' interest in the ''[[longue durée]]'' (long-term), the history of mentalities focuses on the mindsets of past cultural and social groups, and their gradual changes over time, as opposed to the history of particular events, or economic trends. The term can also be seen as an equivalent to, or a form of, [[cultural history]] or [[historical anthropology]]

== History ==

=== ''Annales'' ===
The history of mentalities, or ''histoire des mentalités'', is a term used to describe works of history aimed at describing and analyzing the ways in which people of a given time period thought about, interacted with, and classified the world around them. The history of mentalities has been used as a historical tool by several historians and scholars from various schools of history. Notably, the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]] helped to develop the history of mentalities and construct a methodology from which to operate. In establishing this methodology, they sought to limit their analysis to a particular place and a particular time.&lt;ref name=Duby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duby|first1=Georges|title=The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} This approach lends itself to the intensive study that characterizes microhistory, another field which adopted the history of mentalities as a tool of historical analysis.

The origin of the term history of mentalities lies in the writings of the ''Annales'' historians such as [[Georges Duby]] and [[Roger Chartier]]. In seeking to create works of total history, ''Annales'' historians tended not to simply rely on the political or event oriented history of past generations.&lt;ref name=Harsgor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harsgor|first1=Michael|title=Total History: The Annales School|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|date=January 1978|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Michael Harsgor points out in that the challenge of the ''Annales'' historians was not to create this deterministic history that appeared to rely heavily on teleological conclusions, such as the Marxist forms of history being written at the time. Rather, Harsgor writes that the ''Annales'' historians tasked themselves with the creation of social structures, "which means covering the skeleton of the basic economic analysis with the flesh of demographic, cultural, mental, and event psychoanalytical data."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|4}} It has also been said that ''Annales'' historians, in their attempts at the creation of total history, considered the history of mentalities a single aspect in the creation of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=Patrick|title=The History of Mentalities: The New Map of Cultural History|journal=History and Theory|date=October 1981|volume=20|issue=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they were attempting to reconstruct the world of whatever time period they were examining. In his works, such as ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'' and his work on William Marshal, Duby focused on the development of ideologies within the structures that permeated the various aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name=Duby/&gt;{{rp|9}}

=== Microhistory ===
This development in methodology would prove crucial for other historians who would use the history of mentalities to attempt to reconstruct the worldviews of individuals and extrapolate their findings to the population at large in the form of microhistories. These historians would largely concern themselves with social and cultural history in order to form their history of mentalities, narrowing their realm historical inquiry by not concerning themselves with the broad economic serialization that had become so important for the ''Annales'' historians.&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|2}} [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s book, ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'', is archetypical of the microhistories that emerged with the history of mentalities in mind. Ginzburg attempted to reconstruct peasant mentalities in sixteenth century Italy by examining the trial records of a single miller, Domenico Scandella, called [[Menocchio]], and trying to find currents or similarities in otherwise fragmentary and obscure evidence.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginzburg|first1=Carlo|title=The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

Similar techniques can be seen in [[Robert Darnton]]'s ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', which uses microhistory to establish the mentalities of groups at different social levels of French society. Darnton concerns himself greatly with the ways in which people viewed the world around them. He interprets the symbolic significance of journeymen printers massacring neighborhood cats as a display of frustration with the growing bourgeoisie class.&lt;ref name=Darnton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darnton|first1=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|date=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} Similarly, and in keeping with the tradition of the history of mentalities, Darnton devotes a chapter to an analysis of a bourgeoisie's description of his city, in an effort to determine how an individual in a given social situation would interpret and make sense of the world around them. Darnton uses this description to demonstrate that the ways in which events might be portrayed might be completely unsupported by the ways in which individuals of the time might have interpreted those events.&lt;ref name=Darnton/&gt;{{rp|116}}

== Criticism ==
Criticisms have emerged regarding the history of mentalities at all stages of its development. In particular, [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] were quick to criticize the ''Annales'' historians for "attempts to include the study of mentalities in a general synthesis, which can only lead to the publication of articles reflecting a basic reliance upon faith accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|7}} Carlo Ginzburg himself has criticized the methods of the history of mentalities for its "decidedly classless character."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg/&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Negroponte |first=Nicolas |title=Being Digital |publisher=Vintage |date=1996-01-03 |edition= 1st |isbn= 978-0-679-76290-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=New Rules For The New Economy |journal=Wired |date=1997-09-01 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/newrules.html |accessdate=2011-12-30 |volume=5.09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Esther |title=Release 2.0: A Design For Living In The Digital Age |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=1997 |edition= 1st}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which created "debunking" responses.&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Terry |title=New Media: An Introduction |publisher=OUP Australia and New Zealand |location=South Melbourne |year=2008 |edition= 3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such hype and the negative and positive responses toward it have given way to research that looks empirically at new media and its impact.

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Criticisms==

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Homicide}}

'''Infanticide''' (or '''infant homicide''') is the intentional killing of [[infant]]s.

Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrators of [[neonaticide]]&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Neil S. Kaye M.D - Families, Murder, and Insanity: A Psychiatric Review of Paternal Neonaticide&lt;/ref&gt; and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general.&lt;ref&gt;MARLENE L. DALLEY, Ph.D. The Killing of Canadian Children by Parent(s) or Guardian(s): Characteristics and Trends 1990-1993, January 1997 &amp; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Laila Williamson notes that "Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule."&lt;ref name="InfAnAn"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Williamson  | first = Laila  | contribution = Infanticide: an anthropological analysis  | editor-last = Kohl  | editor-first = Marvin  | title = Infanticide and the Value of Life  | volume =  | pages = 61–75  | publisher = [[Prometheus Books]]  | place = NY  | year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}

In many past societies, certain forms of infanticide were considered permissible. 

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
[[File:InfanticidioGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|''Infanticidio'' by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
The practice of infanticide has taken many forms over time. [[Child sacrifice]] to supernatural figures or forces, such as that believed to have been practiced in ancient [[Carthage]], may be only the most notorious example in the [[ancient world]]. 

A frequent method of infanticide in ancient Europe and Asia was simply to [[child abandonment|abandon the infant]], leaving it to die by exposure (i.e. [[hypothermia]], hunger, thirst, or animal attack).&lt;ref name = "Justin Martyr"&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[First Apology]].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ex&amp;Ob"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Boswell| first = John Eastburn| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  Exposition and oblation: the abandonment of children and the ancient and medieval family  | jstor = 1855916| journal= [[American Historical Review]]| volume = 89  | pages = 10–33  | year = 1984| doi =  10.2307/1855916  | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one island in [[Oceania]], infanticide was carried out until the 20th century by suffocating the infant,&lt;ref name="Collapse"&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]] (2005). ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''. {{ISBN|0-14-303655-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in the [[Inca Empire]] it was carried out by sacrifice (see below).

===Paleolithic and Neolithic===
Many Neolithic groups routinely resorted to infanticide in order to control their numbers so that their lands could support them. [[Joseph Birdsell]] believed that infanticide rates in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Birdsell  | first = Joseph, B.  | contribution = Some predictions for the Pleistocene based on equilibrium systems among recent hunter gatherers  | editor-last = Lee  | editor-first = Richard &amp; Irven DeVore  | title = Man the Hunter  | volume =  | pages = 239  | publisher =Aldine Publishing Co.  | place =  | year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while Laila Williamson estimated a lower rate ranging from 15% to 20%.&lt;ref name="InfAnAn"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Both [[anthropologist]]s believed that these high rates of infanticide persisted until the development of agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Comparative anthropologists have calculated that 50% of female newborn babies were killed by their parents during the [[Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Hoffer|first = Peter| authorlink = Peter Hoffer|author2=N.E.H.

Rituales de vida y muerte en la prehistoria de menorca. Barcelona 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===In ancient history===

====In the New World====
{{Main|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}

[[Archaeologist]]s have uncovered physical evidence of [[child sacrifice]] at several locations.&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|16–22}} Some of the best attested examples are the diverse rites which were part of the religious practices in [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reinhard  | first = Johan  | authorlink =Johan Reinhard|author2=Maria Stenzel  | title = A 6,700 metros niños incas sacrificados quedaron congelados en el tiempo  | journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]  | pages = 36–55  |date=November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452 |title=Discovery Channel: The mystery of Inca child sacrifice |publisher=Exn.ca |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = de Sahagún  | first = Bernardino | authorlink = Bernardino de Sahagún  | title = ''Florentine Codex: History of the Things of New Spain''| publisher = University of Utah Press| date = 1950–1982  | location = Utah  | pages =  | url =  | doi =  | title-link = Florentine Codex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the Old World====
Three thousand bones of young children, with evidence of sacrificial rituals, have been found in [[Sardinia]].  [[Pelasgians]] offered a sacrifice of every tenth child during difficult times. [[Syrians]] sacrificed children to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. Many remains of children have been found in [[Gezer]] excavations with signs of sacrifice. Child skeletons with the marks of sacrifice have been found also in [[Egypt]] dating 950–720 BCE.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In [[Carthage]] "[child] sacrifice in the ancient world reached its infamous zenith".{{attribution needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;{{rp|324}} Besides the Carthaginians, other [[Phoenicians]], and the [[Canaanites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Sepharvite]]s offered their first-born as a sacrifice to their gods.

=====Ancient Egypt=====
In Egyptian households, at all social levels, children of both sexes were valued and there is no evidence of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt and the Egyptians'', Emily Teeter, p. 97, Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0521449847}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of the [[Ancient Egyptian Religion|Ancient Egyptians]] forbade infanticide and during the [[Greco-Roman]] period they rescued abandoned babies from manure heaps, a common method of infanticide by Greeks or Romans, and were allowed to either adopt them as foundlings or raise them as slaves, often giving them names such as "copro -" to memorialise their rescue.&lt;ref&gt;"''Eroticism and Infanticide at Ashkelon"'', Lawrence E. Stager, Biblical Archaeology Review, July/August 1991&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] considered it a peculiarity of the Egyptians that every child must be reared.&lt;ref&gt;''Folkways: A Study of Mores, Manners, Customs and Morals'', [[William Graham Sumner]], p. 318, org pub 1906, Cosmo 2007, {{ISBN|9781602067585}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] indicates infanticide was a punishable offence.&lt;ref&gt;''Life in Ancient Egypt'', [[Adolf Erman]],  Translated by H. M. Tirard, p. 141, org pub 1894, republished Kessinger  2003, {{ISBN|0-7661-7660-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was heavily dependent on the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate the land and in years of low inundation severe famine could occur with breakdowns in social order resulting, notably between 930–1070 AD and 1180–1350 AD. Instances of cannibalism are recorded during these periods but it is unknown if this happened during the pharaonic era of Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Egypt'', David P. Silverman, p. 13, Oxford University Press US, 2003, {{ISBN|0-19-521952-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrix Midant-Reynes describes human sacrifice as having occurred at Abydos in the early dynastic period (c. 3150–2850 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Ian Shaw, p. 54, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-280293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jan Assmann]] asserts there is no clear evidence of human sacrifice ever happening in Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''Of God and Gods'', Jan Assmann, p. 32, University of Wisconsin Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-299-22554-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Carthage=====
&lt;!--

Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

{{Main|Religion in Carthage#Child sacrifice|l1=Carthaginian religion - Child Sacrifice Question}}

According to Shelby Brown, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s, descendants of the [[Phoenicia]]ns, sacrificed infants to their gods.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brown | first = Shelby | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charred bones of hundreds of infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites. One such area harbored as many as 20,000 burial [[urn]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown 1991"/&gt;  Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] (c. 46–120 [[Common Era|AD]]) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], Diodorus Siculus and [[Philo]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practiced at a place called the [[Tophet]] (from the Hebrew ''taph'' or ''toph'', to burn) by the [[Canaan]]ites. Writing in the 3rd century BCE, [[Kleitarchos]], one of the historians of [[Alexander the Great]], described that the infants rolled into the flaming pit. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that babies were roasted to death inside the burning pit of the god [[Baal#Ba'al of Carthage|Baal Hamon]], a bronze statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stager| first = Lawrence| authorlink = Lawrence Stager|author2=Samuel R.

=====Greece and Rome=====
[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 031.jpg|thumb|[[Medea]] killing her sons, by [[Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix]] (1862).]]

The historical Greeks considered the practice of adult and child sacrifice [[Barbarian|barbarous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Hughes|first = Dennis D.|title = Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece | publisher = Routledge|year = 1991|location = |page = 187|url =| isbn=978-0-415-03483-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the exposure of newborns was widely practiced in [[ancient Greece]], it was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity — "As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91| issue=1 |year=2006|pages=F75–7 | author = Dunn PM| journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece the decision to expose a child was typically the father's, although in Sparta the decision was made by a group of elders.&lt;ref&gt;See Plutarch's ''Life of Lycurgus''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure was the preferred method of disposal, as that act in itself was not considered to be murder; moreover, the exposed child technically had a chance of being rescued by the gods or any passersby.&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Budin 2004, 122-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This very situation was a recurring motif in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Infant exposure]]&lt;/ref&gt;
To notify the neighbors of a birth of a child, a woolen strip was hung over the front door to indicate a female baby and an olive branch to indicate a boy had been born. Families did not always keep their new child. After a woman had a baby, she would show it to her husband. If the husband accepted it, it would live, but if he refused it, it would die. Babies would often be rejected if they were illegitimate, unhealthy or deformed, the wrong sex, or too great a burden on the family. These babies would not be directly killed, but put in a clay pot or jar and deserted outside the front door or on the roadway. In ancient Greek religion, this practice took the responsibility away from the parents because the child would die of natural causes, for example hunger, asphyxiation or exposure to the elements.

The practice was prevalent in [[ancient Rome]], as well. [[Philo]] was the first philosopher to speak out against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Philo| authorlink = Philo| title =  The Special Laws| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1950| location =  Cambridge| pages =  III, XX.117, Volume VII, pp. 118, 551, 549| url =| doi= | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from a Roman citizen to his sister, or a pregnant wife from her husband,&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;q=letter+pregnant|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from 1 BC, demonstrates the casual nature with which infanticide was often viewed:
:"I am still in Alexandria. ... I beg and plead with you to take care of our little child, and as soon as we receive wages, I will send them to you. In the meantime, if (good fortune to you!) you give birth, if it is a boy, let it live; if it is a girl, expose it.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-privatelife249.shtml |title=249.

In some periods of [[Roman history]] it was traditional for a newborn to be brought to the ''[[pater familias]]'', the family [[Patriarchy|patriarch]], who would then decide whether the child was to be kept and raised, or left to die by exposure.&lt;ref name=Crossan&gt;John Crossan, ''The Essential Jesus: Original Sayings and Earliest Images'', p. 151 (Castle, 1994, 1998).  {{ISBN|978-1-55635-833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Twelve Tables]] of [[Roman law]] obliged him to put to death a child that was visibly deformed.  The concurrent practices of [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]] and infanticide contributed to the "background noise" of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic#Institution of Slavery|crises during the Republic]].&lt;ref name=Crossan /&gt;

Infanticide became a [[capital offense]] in Roman law in 374 [[Common Era|AD]], but offenders were rarely if ever prosecuted.&lt;ref name="SXR"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Radbill  | first = Samuel X.  | contribution = A history of child abuse and infanticide  | editor-last = Steinmetz  | editor-first = Suzanne K. and [[Murray A. Straus]]  | title = Violence in the Family  | volume =  | pages = 173–179  | publisher = Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.  | place = NY  | year = 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to mythology, [[Romulus and Remus]], twin infant sons of the war god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], survived near-infanticide after being tossed into the Tiber River. According to the myth, they were raised by wolves, and later founded the city of Rome.

=====Judaism=====
Judaism prohibits infanticide, and has for some time, dating back to at least early [[Common Era]].  Roman historians wrote about the ideas and customs of other peoples, which often diverged from their own. [[Tacitus]] recorded that the Jews "regard it as a crime to kill any late-born children".&lt;ref name="Histories"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tacitus| authorlink = Tacitus| title =  The Histories| publisher =  William Heinemann| year =  1931| location =  London|  pages=  Volume II, 183|url =  | doi=    | nopp = true  | title-link = The Histories (Tacitus)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], whose works give an important insight into 1st-century Judaism, wrote that God "forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Josephus| authorlink = Josephus| title =  The Works of Flavius Josephus, "Against Apion"| publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1976| location =  Cambridge| pages =  II.25, p. 597| url =  | doi=     }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pagan European tribes=====
In his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', [[Tacitus]] wrote that the ancient [[Germanic tribes]] enforced a similar prohibition. He found such mores remarkable and commented: ''"[The Germani] hold it shameful to kill any unwanted child."'' Modern scholarship differs. [[John Boswell]] believed that in ancient Germanic tribes unwanted children were exposed, usually in the forest.&lt;ref name="KofS"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boswell| first = John| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  The Kindness of Strangers| publisher = Vintage Books| year =  1988| location =  NY| pages =  | url =| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}} "It was the custom of the [Teutonic] pagans, that if they wanted to kill a son or daughter, they would be killed before they had been given any food."&lt;ref name="KofS"/&gt;{{rp|211}} Usually children born out of wedlock were disposed that way.

In his highly influential ''Pre-historic Times'', [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] described burnt bones indicating the practice of child sacrifice in pagan Britain.&lt;ref name="Pre-historic Times"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lubbock| first = John| authorlink = John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury| title =  Pre-historic Times, as Illustrated by Ancient Remains, and the Manners and Customs of Modern Savages| publisher =  Williams and Norgate | year =  1865| location =  London| page =  176| url =  | doi=     | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last canto, ''Marjatan poika'' (Son of Marjatta), of Finnish [[national epic]] [[Kalevala]] describes an assumed infanticide. [[Väinämöinen]] orders the infant [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]] son of Marjatta to be drowned in [[marsh]].

The [[Íslendingabók]], a main source for the early history of [[Iceland]], recounts that on the [[Íslendingabók#7. Conversion of Iceland to Christianity|Conversion of Iceland to Christianity]] in 1000 it was provided – in order to make the transition more palatable to Pagans – that "the old laws allowing exposure of newborn children will remain in force".
However, this provision – like other concessions made at the time to the Pagans – was abolished some years later.

===Christianity===
[[Christianity]] rejects infanticide. The ''Teachings of the [[Apostles]]'' or ''[[Didache]]'' said "thou shalt not kill a child by [[abortion]], neither shalt thou slay it when born".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last =Robinson  | first =Charles (translator)  | title =The Didache  | pages =76  | publisher =David Nutt   | place =Oxford | year =1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'' stated an identical command, both thus conflating abortion and infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'', xix.5d.&lt;/ref&gt; Apologists [[Tertullian]], [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Lactantius]] also maintained that exposing a baby to death was a wicked act.&lt;ref name="Justin Martyr"/&gt; In 318 [[AD]], [[Constantine I]] considered infanticide a crime, and in 374 [[AD]], [[Valentinian I]] mandated the rearing of all children (exposing babies, especially girls, was still common). The [[Council of Constantinople (1094)|Council of Constantinople]] declared that infanticide was homicide, and in 589 [[AD]], the [[Third Council of Toledo]] took measures against the custom of killing their own children.&lt;ref name="SXR"/&gt;

====Middle Ages====
Whereas theologians and clerics preached sparing their lives, newborn abandonment continued as registered in both the literature record and in legal documents.&lt;ref name="Ex&amp;Ob"/&gt;{{rp|16}} According to [[William L. Langer]], exposure in the [[Middle Ages]] "was practiced on gigantic scale with absolute impunity, noticed by writers with most frigid indifference".&lt;ref name="InfHisSu"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Langer| first = William L.| authorlink = William L. Langer|title = Infanticide: a historical survey| journal = History of Childhood Quarterly| volume = 1  | pages = 353–366  | year = 1974  | pmid = 11614564  | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|355–356}} At the end of the 12th century, notes [[Richard Trexler]], Roman women threw their newborns into the [[Tiber river]] in daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Trexler| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Trexler|title = Infanticide in Florence: new sources and first results| journal = History of Childhood Quarterly| volume = 1  | page = 99  | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it also conjectured that the notion of "rampant" infanticide is a myth pushed by modern historians inferring from lack of particular records, and "there is absolutely no evidence to support such carnage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/medieval-child-surviving-infancy-1789124|title=Surviving Infancy in the Middle Ages|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other European regions, in the Middle Ages the German mother had the right to expose the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westrup| first = C.W.| title =  Introduction to Roman Law| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| year = 1944| location =  London| page = 249| url =  | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gotland]], [[Sweden]], children were also sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Turville-Petre|first = Gabriel | authorlink = Gabriel Turville-Petre| title =Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia | publisher = Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|year = 1964|location =NY |page = 253|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the High Middle Ages, abandoning unwanted children finally eclipsed infanticide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Unwanted children were left at the door of church or abbey, and the clergy was assumed to take care of their upbringing. This practice also gave rise to the first [[orphanage]]s.

However, very high sex ratios were common in even late medieval Europe, which may indicate sex-selective infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Cox Russell, 1958, ''Late Ancient and Medieval Population,'' pp. 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabia===
Some Muslim sources allege that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n society practiced infanticide as a form of "post-partum birth control".&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Children''&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''waʾd'' was used to describe the practice.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Infanticide"&gt;Donna Lee Bowen, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Infanticide&lt;/ref&gt; These sources state that infanticide was practiced either out of destitution (thus practiced on males and females alike), or as "disappointment and fear of social disgrace felt by a father upon the birth of a daughter".&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

Some authors believe that there is little evidence that infanticide was prevalent in pre-Islamic [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] or early [[Muslim history]], except for the case of the [[Banu Tamim|Tamim tribe]], who practiced it during severe famine according to Islamic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Lammens|first = Henri| title = Islam. Belief and Institutions| publisher = Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.|origyear = 1929|year = 1987| location = London|page = 21|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others state that "female infanticide was common all over Arabia during this period of time" (pre-Islamic Arabia), especially by burying alive a female newborn.&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;{{rp|59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith| first = William Robertson| authorlink = Robertson Smith| title =  Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia| publisher =  Adam &amp; Charles Block| year =  1903| location =  London| page =  293| url =  | doi=     }}&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet discovered in [[Yemen]], forbidding the people of a certain town from engaging in the practice, is the only written reference to infanticide within the peninsula in pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Free and bound prepositions: a new look at the inscription Mafray/Qutra 1  |volume=28| date=17-19 July 1997 | pages=169–74| journal=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies |author=Manfred Kropp|jstor= 41223623  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Infanticide is explicitly [[Islam and children#Against infanticide|prohibited by the Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{Cite book| last= Esposito|first = John L.

Other passages condemning infanticide in the Qur'an appear in LXXXI:8-9, XVI:60-62, XVII:42 and XLII:48.&lt;/ref&gt;
Together with [[polytheism]] and [[homicide]], infanticide is regarded as a grave sin (see {{cite quran|6|151|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|60|12|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt; Infanticide is also implicitly denounced in the story of Pharaoh's slaughter of the male children of Israelites (see  {{cite quran|2|49|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|7|127|style=nosup|expand=no}};   {{cite quran|7|141|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|14|6|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|28|4|style=nosup|expand=no}} ;{{cite quran|40|25|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="Children"/&gt;

Infanticide may have been practiced as human sacrifice, as part of the [[pagan]] cult of [[Perun]]. [[Ibn Fadlan]] describes sacrificial practices at the time of his trip to Kiev Rus (present day Ukraine) in 921–922, and describes an incident of a woman voluntarily sacrificing her life as part of a [[funeral rite]] for a prominent leader, but makes no mention of infanticide. The [[Primary Chronicle]], one of the most important literary sources before the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, indicates that human sacrifice to idols may have been introduced by [[Vladimir the Great]] in 980. The same Vladimir the Great formally converted Kiev Rus into [[Christianity]] just 8&amp;nbsp;years later, but pagan cults continued to be practiced clandestinely in remote areas as late as the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.

In [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]], babies were killed and thrown to the dogs.&lt;ref name="StAnHist"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} American explorer [[George Kennan (explorer)|George Kennan]] noted that among the [[Koryaks]], a [[Mongoloid]] people of north-eastern [[Siberia]], infanticide was still common in the nineteenth century.

=== United Kingdom ===
Infanticide (as a crime) gained both popular and bureaucratic significance in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Great Britain|Britain]]. By the [[Mid-19th century|mid 19th century]], in the context of criminal lunacy and the [[Insanity defense|insanity defence]], killing one's own child(ren) attracted ferocious debate, as the role of women in society was defined by motherhood, and it was thought that any woman who murdered her own child was by definition insane and could not be held responsible for her actions. Several cases were subsequently highlighted during the [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864–66|Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1864-66)]], as a particular felony where an effective avoidance of the [[Death penalty in the UK|death penalty]] had informally begun.

The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|New Poor Law Act of 1834]] ended [[English Poor Laws|parish relief]] for unmarried mothers and allowed fathers of illegitimate children to avoid paying for "child support".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1989-0/haller.htm|title=Bastardy and Baby Farming in Victorian England|last=Haller|first=Dorothy L.|date=|website=Loyola University New Orleans|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried mothers then received little assistance and the poor were left with the option either entering the [[workhouse]], prostitution, infanticide or abortion. By the middle of the century infanticide was common for social reasons, such as illegitimacy, and the introduction of [[child life insurance]] additionally encouraged some women to kill their children for gain. Examples are [[Mary Ann Cotton]], who murdered many of her 15 children as well as 3 husbands, [[Margaret Waters]], the 'Brixton Baby Farmer', a professional [[Baby farming|baby-farmer]] who was found guilty of infanticide in 1870, Jessie King hanged in 1889, [[Amelia Dyer]], the 'Angel Maker', who murdered over 400 babies in her care, and [[Ada Williams (baby farmer)|Ada Chard-Williams]], a baby farmer who was later hanged at Newgate prison.

The Times reported that 67 infants were murdered in London in 1861 and 150 more recorded as "found dead", many of which were found on the streets. Another 250 were suffocated, half of them not recorded as accidental deaths. The report noted that "infancy in London has to creep into life in the midst of foes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=rtl_ttda&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS135043741&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=Infanticide in London|last=|first=|date=29 April 1862|work=Times [London, England]|access-date=|page=8|via=The Times Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording a birth as a [[Stillbirth|still-birth]] was also another way of concealing infanticide because still-births did not need to be registered until 1926 and they did not need to be buried in public cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002148/18950201/084/0006|title=Trafficking in Babies.

There are a large number of cases of what are called newly-born children, which are found all over England, more especially in London and large towns, abandoned in streets, rivers, on commons, and so on." He continued "a great deal of that crime is due to what are called lying-in houses, which are not registered, or under the supervision of that sort, where the people who act as midwives constantly, as soon as the child is born, either  drop it into a pail of water or smother it with a damp cloth. It is a very common thing,  also, to find that they bash their heads on the floor and break their skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secret Commissions: An Anthology of Victorian Investigative Journalism|last=Donovan|first=Stephen|last2=Rubery|first2=Matthew|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=9781551113302|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=232–269|chapter=Herbert Cadett.

The last British woman to be executed for infanticide of her own child was [[Rebecca Smith (infanticide)|Rebecca Smith]], who was hanged in Wiltshire in 1849.

The [[Infant Life Protection Act 1897|Infant Life Protection Act of 1897]] required local authorities to be notified within 48 hours of changes in custody or the death of children under seven years. Under the [[Children Act 1908|Children’s Act of 1908]] "no infant could be kept in a home that was so unfit and so overcrowded as to endanger its health, and no infant could be kept by an unfit nurse who threatened, by neglect or abuse, its proper care and maintenance."

Philosopher [[Han Fei Tzu]], a member of the ruling aristocracy of the 3rd century BC, who developed a school of law, wrote: "As to children, a father and mother when they produce a boy congratulate one another, but when they produce a girl they put it to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Yu-Lan|first = Fung|title = A History of Chinese Philosophy| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]|year = 1952|location = Princeton|page = 327|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Hakka people]], and in [[Yunnan]], [[Anhui]], [[Sichuan]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] a method of killing the baby was to put her into a bucket of cold water, which was called "baby water".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Yao |first = Esther S.

Infanticide was known in China as early as the 3rd century BC, and, by the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), it was widespread in some provinces. [[Buddhist]] belief in transmigration allowed poor residents of the country to kill their newborn children if they felt unable to care for them, hoping that they would be reborn in better circumstances. Furthermore, some Chinese did not consider newborn children fully "human", and saw "life" beginning at some point after the sixth month after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774–1873|authors=James Z. Lee, Cameron D. Campbell|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary writers from the Song dynasty note that, in [[Hubei]] and [[Fujian]] provinces, residents would only keep three sons and two daughters (among poor farmers, two sons and one daughter), and kill all babies beyond that number at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drowning girls in China: female infanticide since 1650|author=David E. Mungello|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the sex of the child was only one factor to consider. By the time of the Ming Dynasty, however (1368–1644), male infanticide was becoming increasingly uncommon. The prevalence of female infanticide remained high much longer. The magnitude of this practice is subject to some dispute; however, one commonly quoted estimate is that, by late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]], between one fifth and one quarter of all newborn girls, across the entire social spectrum, were victims of infanticide. If one includes excess mortality among female children under 10 (ascribed to gender-differential neglect), the share of victims rises to one third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drowning daughters: A cultural history of female infanticide in late nineteenth century China|author=Michelle Tien King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774-1873|authors=James Z.

Scottish Physician [[John Dudgeon]], who worked in [[Beijing]], China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]] said that in China, "Infanticide does not prevail to the extent so generally believed among us, and in the north it does not exist at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sB9t4PIqNhQC&amp;dq=formosa+china+partial+same+race&amp;q=Infanticide+does+not+prevail+to+the+extent+so+generally+believed+among+us%2C+and+in+the+north+it+does+not+exist+at+all#v=snippet&amp;q=Infanticide%20does%20not%20prevail%20to%20the%20extent%20so%20generally%20believed%20among%20us%2C%20and%20in%20the%20north%20it%20does%20not%20exist%20at%20all&amp;f=false|title=The Diseases of China, including Formosa and Korea|volume=|year=1910|author=William Hamilton Jefferys|edition= |publisher=P.

Meanwhile, much has been gained. Whereas the effort to argue parents into leaving a child at once and the difficulty of winning the frightened child are enormous. The Chinese infant usually has a pretty good start in life.

====Japan====

Since feudal [[Japan]] the common slang for infanticide was ''"mabiki"'' (間引き) which means to pull plants from an overcrowded garden. A typical method in Japan was smothering through wet paper on the baby's mouth and nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-198607020-00004 | last = Shiono| first = Hiroshi| authorlink = |author2=Atoyo Maya |author3=Noriko Tabata |author4=Masataka Fujiwara |author5=Jun-ich Azumi |author6=Mashahiko Morita| title =  Medicolegal aspects of infanticide in Hokkaido District, Japan| journal =  American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 104–6| year = 1986| url = | pmid = 3740005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became common as a method of population control.

[[Female infanticide]] of newborn girls was systematic in feudatory [[Rajputs]] in [[South Asia]] for [[illegitimate]] female children during the Middle Ages. According to [[Firishta]], as soon as the illegitimate female child was born she was held "in one hand, and a knife in the other, that any person who wanted a wife might take her now, otherwise she was immediately put to death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westermarck| first = Edward| authorlink = Edward Westermarck| title =  A Short History of Marriage| publisher =  Humanities Press| year =  1968| location =  NY| pages =  Vol. III, 162| url = | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of female infanticide was also common among the Kutch, Kehtri, Nagar, Bengal, Miazed, Kalowries in [[India]] inhabitants, and also among the [[Sindh]] in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Panigrahi| first = Lalita |title =  British Social Policy and Female Infanticidein India| publisher =  Munshiram Manoharlal| year =  1972| location = New Delhi| page = 18| url = | doi=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

In some [[Africa]]n societies some neonates were killed because of beliefs in evil omens or because they were considered unlucky. Twins were usually put to death in Arebo; as well as by the [[Nama people]] of [[South West Africa]]; in the [[Lake Victoria|Lake Victoria Nyanza]] region; by the [[Tswana people|Tswana]] in [[Portuguese East Africa]]; in some parts of [[Igboland]], [[Nigeria]] twins were sometimes abandoned in a forest at birth (as depicted in ''[[Things Fall Apart]]''), oftentimes one twin was killed or hidden by midwives of wealthier mothers; and by the [[!Kung people]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|160–161}} The [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Kenya]]'s most populous ethnic group, practiced ritual killing of twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = LeVine  | first = Sarah and Robert LeVine  | contribution = Child abuse and neglect in Sub-Saharan Africa  | editor-last = Korbin  | editor-first = Jill  | title = Child Abuse and Neglect  | volume =  | pages = 39  | publisher = [[University of California Press]]  | place = Berkeley  | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanticide is rooted in the old traditions and beliefs prevailing all over the country. A survey conducted by [[Disability Rights International]] found that 45% women interviewed by them in Kenya were pressured to kill their children born with disabilities. The pressure being much higher in the rural areas, with every second mother being forced out of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45670750|title=Infanticide in Kenya: 'I was told to kill my disabled baby'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Literature suggests infanticide may have occurred reasonably commonly among Indigenous Australians, in all areas of Australia prior to European settlement.  Infanticide may have continued to occur quite often up until the 1960s.  An 1866 issue of ''The Australian News for Home Readers'' informed readers that "the crime of infanticide is so prevalent amongst the natives that it is rare to see an infant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My First Born|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63170296|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Victoria, Australia|date=20 January 1866|page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Susanna de Vries]] in 2007 told a newspaper that her accounts of Aboriginal violence, including infanticide, were censored by publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.  She told reporters that the censorship "stemmed from guilt over the stolen children question".&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aboriginal violence was 'sanitised'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/aboriginal-violence-was-sanitised/story-e6frg6nf-1111113906387|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=13 April 2013|author=Justine Ferrari|date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Keith Windschuttle]] weighed in on the conversation, saying this type of censorship started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" /&gt;  In the same article [[Louis Nowra]] suggested that infanticide in customary Aboriginal law may have been because it was difficult to keep an abundant number of Aboriginal children alive; there were life-and-death decisions modern-day Australians no longer have to face.&lt;ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" /&gt;

====South Australia and Victoria====
According to [[William D. Rubinstein]], "Nineteenth-century European observers of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] life in South Australia and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] reported that about 30% of Aboriginal infants were killed at birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rubinstein | first = W.

[[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]] wrote a passage about infanticide among Indigenous people in the western district of Victoria, which stated that "Twins are as common among them as among Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce, and a large family troublesome to move about, it is lawful and customary to destroy the weakest twin child, irrespective of sex.
It is usual also to destroy those which are malformed."&lt;ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Aborigines: The Languages and Customs of Several Tribes of Aborigines in the Western District of Victoria, Australia|publisher=George Robertson (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; {{ISBN|978-1-108-00655-2}})|author=James Dawson|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote "When a woman has children too rapidly for the convenience and necessities of the parents, she makes up her mind to let one be killed, and consults with her husband which it is to be. As the strength of a tribe depends more on males than females, the girls are generally sacrificed.
The child is put to death and buried, or burned without ceremony; not, however, by its father or mother, but by relatives. No one wears mourning for it.
Sickly children are never killed on account of their bad health, and are allowed to die naturally."&lt;ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide /&gt;

In 1937, a reverend in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] offered a "baby bonus" to Aboriginal families as a deterrent against infanticide and to increase the birthrate of the local Indigenous population.&lt;ref name=RevLoveBabyBonus&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron-Roofed Cottage as Baby Bonus|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85590904|publisher=The Daily News|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=11 March 1937 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australian Capital Territory====
A [[Canberra]]n journalist in 1927 wrote of the "cheapness of life" to the Aboriginal people local to the Canberra area 100&amp;nbsp;years before.  "If drought or bush fires had devastated the country and curtailed food supplies, babies got short shift.

Annette Hamilton, a professor of anthropology at [[Macquarie University]] who carried out research in the Aboriginal community of Maningrida in Arnhem Land during the 1960s wrote that prior to that time part-European babies born to Aboriginal mothers had not been allowed to live, and that 'mixed-unions are frowned on by men and women alike as a matter of principle'.&lt;ref name=Australia1999Brunton&gt;{{cite web|title=Moral Dilemma Not Merely A Question of Black and White|url=http://www.ipa.org.au/news/682/moral-dilemma-not-merely-a-question-of-black-and-white/pg/8|publisher=Courier Mail|accessdate=13 April 2013|author=Ron Brunton|date=13 March 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522000520/http://www.ipa.org.au/news/682/moral-dilemma-not-merely-a-question-of-black-and-white/pg/8|archive-date=22 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They agreed to have all newborn male babies killed. It is not known how many male babies were killed by being smothered, but it had reportedly happened to all males over a 10-year period and probably was still happening.

==Modern proposals==
In a 2012 article in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'', a philosopher and a bioethicist jointly proposed that infanticide be legalized, calling it "after-birth abortion", and claiming that both "the fetus and the newborn are potential persons". Many replies were published to this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alberto Giubilini1,2, Francesca Minerva3 |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full |title=After-birth abortion: why should the baby live? - Giubilini and Minerva - Journal of Medical Ethics |publisher=Jme.bmj.com |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child euthanasia===
{{Main|Child euthanasia}}
[[Euthanasia]] applied to children that are gravely ill or that suffer from significant birth defects is legal in the [[Netherlands]] under rigidly controlled conditions, but controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Groningen Protocol — Euthanasia in Severely Ill Newborns| doi=10.1056/NEJMp058026 | volume=352|issue = 10|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|pages=959–962|pmid=15758003|date=March 2005|vauthors=Verhagen E, Sauer PJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have compared child euthanasia to infanticide.

==Explanations for the practice==

There are various reasons for infanticide.  Neonaticide typically has different patterns and causes than for killing of older infants. Traditional neonaticide is often related to economic necessity - inability to provide for the infant.

In the United Kingdom and the United States, older infants are typically killed for reasons related to [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]] or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt; For infants older than one day, younger infants are more at risk, and boys are more at risk than girls.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;  Risk factors for the parent include: Family history of violence, violence in current relationship, history of abuse or neglect of children, and personality disorder and/or depression.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;

===Religious===
In the late seventeenth and early  eighteenth centuries, "loopholes" were invented by those who wanted to avoid the damnation that was promised by most Christian doctrine as a penalty of suicide. One famous example of someone who wished to end their life but avoid the eternity in hell was [[Christina Johansdotter]] (died 1740).  She was a Swedish murderer who killed a child in Stockholm with the sole purpose of being executed.  She is an example of those who seek suicide through execution by committing a murder.  It was a common act, frequently targeting young children or infants as they were believed to be free from sin, thus going straight to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Jeffrey Rodgers (2004) From Sin to Insanity: Suicide in Early Modern Europe. Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Lieut. F. Elton reported that Ugi beach people in the [[Solomon Islands]] killed their infants at birth by burying them, and women were also said to practice abortion. They reported that it was too much trouble to raise a child, and instead preferred to buy one from the bush people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elton| first = Lieut. F.| title =  Notes  on Natives of the Solomon Islands | journal =  The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| volume = 17| issue = | pages = 90–99| year = 1988| jstor =2841588| doi =  10.2307/2841588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Many historians believe the reason to be primarily economic, with more children born than the family is prepared to support.  In societies that are [[patrilineal]] and [[patrilocal]], the family may choose to allow more sons to live and kill some daughters, as the former will support their birth family until they die, whereas the latter will leave economically and geographically to join their husband's family, possibly only after the payment of a burdensome [[dowry]] price.  Thus the decision to bring up a boy is more economically rewarding to the parents.&lt;ref name="Hardness"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Milner  | first = Larry S.  | title = Hardness of Heart / Hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide  | publisher = University Press of America  | location =  Lanham/New York/Oxford| year = 2000| url =  | doi =   |isbn=978-0-7618-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|362–368}} However, this does not explain why infanticide would occur equally among rich and poor, nor why it would be as frequent during decadent periods of the [[Roman Empire]] as during earlier, less affluent, periods.&lt;ref name="Hardness"/&gt;{{rp|28–34, 187–192}}

Before the appearance of effective [[contraception]], infanticide was a common occurrence in ancient brothels. Unlike usual infanticide - where historically girls have been more likely to be killed - prostitutes in certain areas preferred to kill their male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK 18th and 19th century====
Instances of infanticide in Britain in 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries is often attributed to the economic position of the women, with juries committing [[Jury nullification|“pious perjury”]] in many subsequent murder cases. The knowledge of the difficulties  faced in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century by those women who attempted to keep their children can be seen as reason for juries to show compassion. If the woman chose to keep the child, society was not set up to ease the pressure placed upon the woman, legally, socially or economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank |title=Crime and Punishment in 18th&amp;nbsp;Century England |publisher=Routledge |location=London, UK |year=1989 |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-18th century Britain there was assistance available for women who were not able to raise their children. The [[Foundling Hospital]] opened in 1756 and was able to take in some of the illegitimate children. However, the conditions within the hospital caused [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] to withdraw funding and the governors to live off of their own incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood |journal=Old and New London Journal |volume=5 |year=1878 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a stringent entrance policy, with the committee requiring that the hospital:

:Will not receive a child that is more than a year old, nor the child of a domestic servant, nor any child whose father can be compelled to maintain it.&lt;ref name="unknown 1878"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood |journal=Old and New London Journal |volume=5 |year=1878  |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a mother had admitted her child to the hospital, the hospital did all it could to ensure that the parent and child were not re-united.&lt;ref name="unknown 1878"/&gt;

MacFarlane argues in ''Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in Britain'' (1980) that English society greatly concerned itself with the burden that a bastard child places upon its communities and had gone to some lengths to ensure that the father of the child is identified in order to maintain its well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacFarlane |first=Alan |title=Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in English History |page=75 |publisher=Arnold |year=1980 |work=Bastardy and its Comparative History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistance could be gained through maintenance payments from the father, however, this was capped "at a miserable 2&amp;nbsp;[[shilling|s]] and 6&amp;nbsp;[[pence|d]] a week".&lt;ref name="Rose 1986 28"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose  |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=28 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the father fell behind with the payments he could only be asked "to pay a maximum of 13&amp;nbsp;weeks arrears".&lt;ref name="Rose 1986 28"/&gt;

Despite the accusations of some that women were getting a free hand-out there is evidence that many women were far from receiving adequate assistance from their parish. "Within Leeds in 1822 ... relief was limited to 1&amp;nbsp;[[shilling|s]] per week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=25 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield required women to enter the [[workhouse]], whereas Halifax gave no relief to the women who required it. The prospect of entering the workhouse was certainly something to be avoided. Lionel Rose quotes Dr&amp;nbsp;[[Joseph Rogers (physician)|Joseph Rogers]] in ''Massacre of the Innocents ...'' (1986). Rogers, who was employed by a London workhouse in 1856 stated that conditions in the nursery were ‘wretchedly damp and miserable ... [and] ... overcrowded with young mothers and their infants’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |pages=31–33 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of social standing for a servant girl was a particular problem in respect of producing a bastard child as they relied upon a good character reference in order to maintain their job and more importantly, to get a new or better job. In a large number of trials for the crime of infanticide, it is the servant girl that stood accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank  |title=Crime and Punishment in 18th Century England |publisher=Routledge |location=London, UK |year=1989 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage of being a servant girl is that they had to live to the social standards of their superiors or risk dismissal and no references. Whereas within other professions, such as in the factory, the relationship between employer and employee was much more anonymous and the mother would be better able to make other provisions, such as employing a minder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Lionel |title=Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800–1939 |page=19 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan |location=London, UK |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the lack of basic social care in Britain in the 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;century is the numerous accounts in court records of women, particularly servant girls, standing trial for the murder of their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hitchcock |first1=Tim |last2=Shoemaker |first2=Robert |url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org |title=The Proceedings of the Old Bailey |publisher=University of Sheffield and University of Hertfordshire |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may have been no specific offence of infanticide in England before about 1623 because infanticide was a matter for the  by [[ecclesiastical court]]s, possibly because [[infant mortality]] from natural causes was high (about 15% or one in six).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Urban disease and mortality in nineteenth-century England |author1=Woods, R. |author2=Woodward, J. |publisher=Batsford |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-7134-3707-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter the accusation of the suppression of bastard children by lewd mothers was a crime incurring the presumption of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The history of infanticide in England |first=Alan |last=MacFarlane |year=2002 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/A-INFANT.PDF |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Infanticide Act]]s are several [[English Law|laws]]. That of 1922 made the killing of an infant child by its mother during the early months of life as a lesser crime than murder. The acts of 1938 and 1939 abolished the earlier act, but introduced the idea that [[postpartum depression]] was legally to be regarded as a form of [[diminished responsibility]].

===Population control===
[[Marvin Harris]] estimated that among [[Paleolithic]] hunters 23–50% of newborn children were killed.  He argued that the goal was to preserve the 0.001% population growth of that time.&lt;ref name="Cannibals&amp;Kings"/&gt;{{RP|15}}  He also wrote that female infanticide may be a form of [[population control]].&lt;ref name="Cannibals&amp;Kings"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Harris  | first = Marvin  | authorlink = Marvin Harris  | title = Cannibals and Kings: The Origins of Cultures  | publisher = Random House  | year = 1977   | location = NY  | url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|5}}  Population control is achieved not only by limiting the number of potential mothers; increased fighting among men for access to relatively scarce wives would also lead to a decline in population.  For example, on the [[Melanesia]]n island of [[Tikopia]] infanticide was used to keep a stable population in line with its [[carrying capacity|resource base]].&lt;ref name="Collapse" /&gt;&lt;!--He devotes a chapter to this aspect of Tikopia--&gt;  Research by Marvin Harris and [[William Divale]] supports this argument, it has been cited as an example of [[environmental determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hallpike | first = C.R.  | title = The Principles of Social Evolution  | publisher = Claredon Press  | year = 1988  | location = Oxford| pages = 237–238  | url =  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===

====Evolutionary psychology====
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has proposed several theories for different forms of infanticide. Infanticide by stepfathers, as well as child abuse in general by stepfathers, has been explained by spending resources on not genetically related children reducing  [[reproductive success]] (See the [[Cinderella effect]] and  [[Infanticide (zoology)]]). Infanticide is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research has found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]], in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men, to spend resources on the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liddle | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Shackelford | first2 = T. K. | last3 = Weekes–Shackelford | first3 = V. A. | title = Why can't we all just get along? Evolutionary perspectives on violence, homicide, and war | doi = 10.1037/a0026610 | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 16 | pages = 24–36 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Early infanticidal childrearing"====
A minority of academics subscribe to an alternate school of thought, considering the practice as "[[early infanticidal childrearing]]".&lt;ref name="EMOL"&gt;{{Cite book| last = deMause  | first = Lloyd  | authorlink = Lloyd deMause | title = The Emotional Life of Nations  | publisher = Karnak  | year = 2002  | location = NY, London  | pages = 258–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246–247}} They attribute parental infanticidal wishes to massive [[projection (psychology)|projection]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] of the parents' [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] onto the child, because of intergenerational, ancestral abuse by their own parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Godwin   | first = Robert W.  | title = One cosmos under God  | publisher = Paragon House  | year = 2004  | location = Minnesota  | pages = 124–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, an infanticidal parent may have multiple motivations, conflicts, emotions, and thoughts about their baby and their relationship with their baby, which are often colored both by their individual psychology, current relational context and attachment history, and, perhaps most saliently, their psychopathology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Almeida A, Merminod G, Schechter DS | year = 2009 | title = Mothers with severe psychiatric illness and their newborns:  a hospital-based model of perinatal consultation | url = | journal = Journal of ZERO-TO-THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 40–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also Psychiatric section below) Almeida, Merminod, and Schechter suggest that parents with fantasies, projections, and delusions involving infanticide need to be taken seriously and assessed carefully, whenever possible, by an interdisciplinary team that includes infant mental health specialists or mental health practitioners who have experience in working with parents, children, and families.

====Wider effects====
In addition to debates over the morality of infanticide itself, there is some debate over the effects of infanticide on surviving children, and the effects of childrearing in societies that also sanction infanticide. Some argue that the practice of infanticide in any widespread form causes enormous psychological damage in children.&lt;ref name="EMOL"/&gt;{{rp|261–262}} Conversely, studying societies that practice infanticide [[Géza Róheim]] reported that even infanticidal mothers in [[New Guinea]], who ate a child, did not affect the personality development of the surviving children; that "these are good mothers who eat their own children".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Róheim| first = Géza| authorlink = Géza Róheim| title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology| publisher = International Universities Press | year = 1950 | location = NY | pages =  60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris and Divale's work on the relationship between female infanticide and warfare suggests that there are, however, extensive negative effects.

===Psychiatric===
{{see also|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth}}

[[Postpartum psychosis]] is also a causative factor of infanticide. Stuart S. Asch, MD, a Professor of Psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|Cornell University]] established the connections between some cases of infanticide and post-partum depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Crib deaths: their possible relationship to post-partum depression and infanticide|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=5239550 | volume=35 |issue=3 |journal=J Mt Sinai Hosp N Y |pages=214–20 | author = Asch SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Postpartum reactions: some unrecognized variations|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=4857893 | doi=10.1176/ajp.131.8.870 |volume=131 |issue=8 |journal=Am J Psychiatry |pages=870–4 |vauthors=Asch SS, Rubin LJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books, ''From Cradle to Grave'',&lt;ref&gt;Egginton, Joyce.

William Morrow, New York&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Death of Innocents'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Firstman and Jamie Talan.  The Death of Innocents. Bantam, New York. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; describe selected cases of maternal infanticide and the investigative research of Professor Asch working in concert with the New York City Medical Examiner's Office.
Stanley Hopwood wrote that childbirth and lactation entail severe stress on the female sex, and that under certain circumstances attempts at infanticide and suicide are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Hopwood  | first = Stanley, J.  | title = Child murder and insanity  | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Psychopathology  | volume = 73  | page = 96  | year = 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' revealed that 44% of filicidal [[father]]s had a diagnosis of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Campion| first = John| authorlink = |author2=James M. Cravens |author3=Fred Covan| title =  A study of filicidal men| journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 145| issue = | page = 143| year = 1988| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to postpartum psychosis, dissociative psychopathology and sociopathy have also been found to be associated with neonaticide in some cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spinelli MG | year = 2001 | title = A systematic investigation of 16 cases of neonaticide | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5| pages = 811–3 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.811 | pmid=11329409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, severe [[postpartum depression]] can lead to infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Perspect Public Health| year = 2009 | volume = 129 | number = 5 | pages = 221–7 | title = Postnatal depression: a global public health perspective | author = Almond P. | doi=10.1177/1757913909343882| pmid = 19788165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex selection===
&lt;!-- Female infanticide redirects here --&gt;
[[Sex selection]] may be one of the contributing factors of infanticide. In the absence of [[sex-selective abortion]], sex-selective infanticide{{Dead link|date=August 2013}} can be deduced from very skewed birth statistics. The biologically normal [[sex ratio for humans]] at birth is approximately 105 males per 100 females; normal ratios hardly ranging beyond 102–108.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barclay |first=George W. |title=Techniques of Population Analysis |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1958n|location=New York, NY |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a society has an infant male to female ratio which is [[statistical significance|significantly]] higher or lower than the biological norm, and biased data can be ruled out, sex selection can usually be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;This is a major issue in [[classical demography|ancient]] and [[medieval demography]] Josiah Cox (1958) notes evidence of sex-selective infanticide in the Roman world and very high sex ratios in the medieval world. See: {{cite book |first=Josiah Cox |last=Russell |year=1958 |title=Late Ancient and Medieval Population |pages=13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law==

===Australia===
In [[New South Wales (Australia)|New South Wales]], infanticide is defined in Section 22A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|22A}} Infanticide; see also {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1755|2014|litigants=R v MB (No. 2) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Where a woman by any willful act or omission causes the death of her child, being a child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for this section the offence would have amounted to murder, she shall be guilty of infanticide, and may for such offence be dealt with and punished as if she had been guilty of the offence of manslaughter of such child.}}

Because Infanticide is punishable as manslaughter, as per s24,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|24}} Manslaughter--punishment.&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum penalty for this offence is therefore 25 years imprisonment.

===India===
Infanticide is illegal in India, but rarely enforced in the rural parts of India. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Canada===
In Canada, a mother commits infanticide, a lesser offence than homicide, if she killed her child while "not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child and by reason thereof or of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child her mind is then disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-124.html#docCont RSC 1985, c C-46, s 233].&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], the [[Infanticide Act 1938]] describes the offence of infanticide as one which would otherwise amount to murder (by his/her mother) if the victim was older than 12 months and the mother was not suffering from an imbalance of mind due to the effects of childbirth or lactation. Where a mother who has killed such an infant has been charged with murder rather than infanticide s.1(3) of the Act confirms that a jury has the power to find alternative verdicts of [[manslaughter|Manslaughter in English law]] or guilty but insane.

===Romania===
Article 200 of the [[Penal Code of Romania#The Penal Code of 2014|Penal Code of Romania]] stipulates that the killing of a newborn during the first 24 hours, by the mother who is in a state of mental distress, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html|title=Noul Cod Penal (2014)|website=avocatura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Romanian Penal Code also defined infanticide (''pruncucidere'') as a distinct criminal offence, providing for a punishment of two to seven years imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/cod-penal-actualizat-2011/art-177-cpen|title=Art. 177 Cod penal Pruncuciderea Omuciderea INFRACŢIUNI CONTRA VIEŢII, INTEGRITĂŢII CORPORALE ŞI SĂNĂTĂŢII|website=legeaz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing the fact that a mother's judgment may be impaired immediately after birth, but did not define the term "infant", and this had led to debates regarding the precise moment when infanticide becomes homicide. This issue was resolved by the new Penal Code, which came into force in 2014.

===United States===
In 2009, [[Texas]] state representative [[Jessica Farrar]] proposed legislation that would define infanticide as a distinct and lesser crime than [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/032209dnmetinfanticide.3030173.html Proposed Texas House bill would recognize postpartum psychosis as a defense for moms who kill infants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417132305/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/032209dnmetinfanticide.3030173.html |date=April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the proposed legislation, if jurors concluded that a mother's "judgment was impaired as a result of the effects of giving birth or the effects of lactation following the birth", they would be allowed to convict her of the crime of infanticide, rather than murder.&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/when-infanticide-isnt-mur_b_279703.html |title=When Infanticide Isn't Murder |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-07-18 |date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for infanticide would be two years in prison.&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/&gt; Farrar's introduction of this bill prompted liberal bioethics scholar [[Jacob M. Appel]] to call her "the bravest politician in America".&lt;ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/&gt;

==Prevention==

Since infanticide, especially neonaticide, is often a response to an unwanted birth,&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt; preventing [[unwanted pregnancies]] through improved [[sex education]] and increased [[birth control|contraceptive]] access are advocated as ways of preventing infanticide.&lt;ref name=Friedman2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Neonaticide: Phenomenology and considerations for prevention |journal=Int J Law Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19064290 |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.11.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased use of contraceptives and access to safe legal abortions&lt;ref name="Hardness" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;{{rp|122–123}} have greatly reduced neonaticide in many developed nations.  Some say that where abortion is illegal, as in Pakistan, infanticide would decline if safer legal abortions were available.&lt;ref name =tribune /&gt;

Screening for psychiatric disorders or risk factors, and providing treatment or assistance to those at risk may help prevent infanticide.&lt;ref name=FriedmanDepress&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Postpartum depression: an update |journal=Women's Health (Lond Engl) |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=287–95 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19392614 |doi=10.2217/whe.09.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in developed world significant proportions of neonaticides that are detected occur in young women who deny their pregnancy, and avoid outside contacts, so they may have limited contact with health care services.&lt;ref name=Marks2009/&gt;

In some areas [[baby hatch]]es or ''safe surrender sites'', safe places for a mother to anonymously leave an infant, are offered, in part to reduce the rate of infanticide.  In other places, like the United States, [[safe-haven law]]s allow mothers to anonymously give infants to designated officials; they are frequently located at hospitals and police and fire stations.  Typically such babies are put up for adoption, or cared for in orphanages.

Granting women employment raises their status and autonomy. Having a [[gainful employment]] can raise the perceived worth of females. This can lead to an increase in the number of women getting an education and a decrease in the number of female infanticide. As a result, the [[infant mortality]] rate will decrease and economic development will increase.&lt;ref name="Fuse"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuse|first=K|author2=Crenshaw, E.M|title=Gender imbalance in infant mortality: A cross-national study of social structure and female infanticide|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2006|volume=62|issue=2|pages=360–374|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.06.006|pmid=16046041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Mones.jpg|thumb|Infanticide occurs in other animals, such as in [[Hanuman langur]]s.]]

{{Main|Infanticide (zoology)}}
Although human infanticide has been widely studied, the practice has been observed in many other species of the [[animal]] kingdom since it was first seriously studied by [[:jp:杉山幸丸|Yukimaru Sugiyama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sugiyama Y | year = 1965 | title = On the social change of Hanuman langurs (''Presbytis entellus'') in their natural conditions | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 6 | issue = 3–4| pages = 381–417 | doi=10.1007/bf01730356}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include from microscopic [[rotifer]]s and [[insect]]s, to [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, including primates such as [[chacma baboon]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoogland"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoogland J. L. | year = 1985 | title = Infanticide in Prairie Dogs: Lactating Females Kill Offspring of Close Kin | url = | journal = Science | volume = 230 | issue = 4729| pages = 1037–1040 | doi=10.1126/science.230.4729.1037 | pmid=17814930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infanticide can be practiced by both [[male]]s and [[female]]s.

According to studies carried out by [[Kyoto University]] in non-human primates, including certain types of gorillas and chimpanzees, several conditions favor the tendency to infanticide in some species (to be performed only by males), among them are: Nocturnal live, the absence of nest construction, the marked sexual dimorphism in which the male is much larger than the female, the mating in a specific season and the high period of lactation without resumption of the estrus state in the female.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2761">The term '''information cycle''' refers to the way information is processed and distributed and how it changes over time. It is usually used to describe the progression of [[news media|media]] coverage relating to a particular newsworthy event or topic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.tru.ca/infocycle|title=Tru Libraries|last=|first=|date=10 March 2018|website=Thompson Rivers University|archive-url=https://libguides.tru.ca/infocycle|archive-date=10 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which information goes through various stages of reporting and publication. 

In the cycle model, information begins circulation with a [[news story]] presented via the [[Internet]], [[television]], [[radio]], or [[newspaper]], followed by its release in [[magazine]]s. The information is then researched by scholars and published in [[academic journal]]s or books and presented at academic conferences. Finally, if the information is considered important enough, it is included in reference works such as [[handbook]]s and [[encyclopedia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/howdoi/informationcycle.html |publisher=University Library, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |title=The Information Cycle |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As information passes through these stages, its content and presentation changes. Initial news coverage may take place [[24-hour news cycle|as events unfold]], and offer only the basics in terms of "who, what, when, and where." News magazines will provide more background information, adding the [[Five Ws|fifth W]], "why," especially in less frequently appearing or specialized periodicals. As more time passes, scholars will research the information and write detailed studies that take historical context and long-term meaning into account. Finally, after a few years, books regarding the information may appear. 

Understanding the information cycle helps aid researchers and academics in determining the validity of source material. For instance, the cycle model is commonly taught in [[Library instruction|library education]].{{r|teaching}} Information flow in this model can be thought of as a cycle because, conceptually, the published information might spark new ideas which will pass through similar stages.&lt;ref name="teaching"&gt;{{cite book |title=Teaching Information Literacy: 50 Standards-based Exercises for College Students |first1=Joanna M. |last1=Burkhardt |first2=Mary C. |last2=MacDonald |first3=Andrée J. |last3=Rathemacher |publisher=American Library Association |year=2010 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally used in Chinese poetry as a four-line composition, such as [[Qijue]], and is also referred to as {{Nihongo||起承転合|kishōtengō}}. The first [[Chinese character]] refers to the introduction or {{Nihongo||起句|kiku}}, the next: development, {{Nihongo||承句|shōku}}, the third: twist, {{Nihongo||転句|tenku}}, and the last character indicates conclusion or {{Nihongo||結句|kekku}}. 句 is the {{nihongo|[[phrase]]|句|ku}}, and {{nihongo||合|gō}} means "meeting point of ''introduction'' 起 and ''twist'' 転" for conclusion.

The following is an example of how this might be applied to a fairytale.
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: introducing [[Fictional character|characters]], era, and other important information for understanding the setting of the [[narrative|story]].
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: follows leads towards the twist in the story. Major changes do not occur. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: the story turns toward an unexpected development. This is the crux of the story, the {{Nihongo||ヤマ|yama}} or climax. In case of several turns in the narrative, this is the biggest one. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}, also called {{Nihongo||落ち|ochi}} or ending, wraps up the story.

A specific example by the poet Sanyō Rai (頼山陽):
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: Daughters of Itoya, in the [[Honmachi]] of [[Osaka]].
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: The elder daughter is sixteen and the younger one is fourteen. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: Throughout history, generals (''[[daimyō]]s'') killed the enemy with bows and arrows. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}: The daughters of Itoya kill with their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, S. K. (1997). ''Japanese communication: Language and thought in context.'' Honolulu, HI: University of Hawai'i Press, 159-162.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first verse introduces the female characters of the story. The second verse gives more details about both. Verse three goes astray to an unrelated territory. Verse four explains: The main characters of the story seduce men with their eyes – killing them just as the, until now, unrelated generals who kill with bows and arrow – thus showing the relation of the daughters of Itoya and the killing generals.

The same pattern is used to arrange arguments:
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: In old times, copying information by hand was necessary. Some mistakes were made.
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: Copying machines made it possible to make quick and accurate copies. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: Traveling by car saves time, but you don't get much impression of the local beauty. Walking makes it a lot easier to appreciate nature close up. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}: Although photocopying is easier, copying by hand is sometimes better, because the information stays in your memory longer and can be used later. 

In the structure of narrative and [[yonkoma]] [[manga]], and even for [[document]] and [[dissertation]], the style in ''kishōtenketsu'' applies to sentence or sentences, and even [[clause]] to [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] as well as the phrase for understandable introduction to conclusion.

The concept has also been used in [[game design]], particularly in [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]]s, most notably ''[[Super Mario]]'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' (2007) and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' (2013); their designers [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and Koichi Hayashida are known to utilize this concept for their game designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-17-how-nintendos-best-mario-levels-were-structured-using-chinese-poetry | title=Nintendo's "kishōtenketsu" Mario level design philosophy explained | work=Eurogamer.net | date=2015-03-17 | accessdate=September 16, 2016 | author=Tom Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
'''Kulig''' (sleigh rides) is an old [[Poland|Polish]] winter tradition dating back to the days of the [[szlachta]] (nobility).

The kulig was a [[sleigh]] ride party organized among the Polish aristocracy. A cavalcade of horse-pulled sleighs and sleds went from one manor house to another, entertained everywhere with hearty meals followed by dancing.

Nowadays Kulig rides are a popular tourist attraction in the Polish [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra mountains]], advertised and practiced in places such as [[Zakopane]]. However, this practice is often borderline illegal and dangerous for passengers and horses alike. Since they provide significant profits Kulig rides are organized no matter what the weather conditions and even out of season. Horses are forced to pull overloaded sleighs - it is not uncommon that the number of passengers exceeds the capacity of the sleigh itself. What is worse - sometimes sleighs are being pulled not on snow, but on mud, stone and even asphalt. There have been numerous reports of Kulig rides causing horses to die out of exhaustion or accidents due to bad terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tvs.pl/informacje/kon-kuligu-wisle-przewrocil-sie-umarl-dzialo-sie-oczach-turystow-wideo-zdjecia/|title=Koń podczas kuligu w Wiśle przewrócił się i umarł!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8676">The '''last offices''', or '''laying out''', is the procedures performed, usually by a [[nurse]], to the body of a dead person shortly after [[death]] has been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;http://bereavementsupport.co.uk/how-will-the-person-be-cared-for-immediately-after-they-have-died/the-person-has-died-in-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt; They can vary between [[hospital|hospitals]] and between [[culture|cultures]].

==Name==
The word "offices" is related to the original [[Latin]], in which ''officium'' means "service, duty,  business".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=office&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence these are the "last duties" carried out on the body.

==Aims==
*To prepare the deceased for the mortuary (a funeral home or morgue), respecting their cultural beliefs
*To comply with legislation, in particular where the death of a patient requires the involvement of a Procurator Fiscal aka. Coroner
*To minimise any risk of cross-infection to relative, health care worker or persons who may need to handle the deceased
&lt;ref&gt;Rana, D., &amp; Upton, D. (2009). Psychology for nurses. Essex, UK: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Often the body of the deceased is left for up to an [[hour]] as a mark of respect. The procedure then typically includes the following steps, though they can vary according to an institution's preferred practices:
*Removal of [[jewellery]] unless requested otherwise by the deceased's family. If left on it must be documented in the patient's property list.
*[[Wounds]], including [[Skin ulcer|pressure sores]], should be covered with a waterproof [[dressing (medical)|dressing]]. Tube insertion points should be padded with gauze and tape to avoid purging.
*The patient is laid on his/her back with arms by their side (unless religious customs demand otherwise). [[Eyelid]]s are closed.
*The [[jaw]] is often supported with a pillow or cervical collar.
*[[Dentures]] should be left in place, unless inappropriate.
*The [[bladder]] is drained by applying pressure on the lower [[abdomen]]. Orifices are blocked only if leakage of body fluid is evident.
*The body is then washed and dried, the mouth cleaned and the face shaved.
*An identification bracelet is put on the [[ankle]] detailing: the name of the patient; date of birth; date and time of death; name of ward (if patient died in hospital); patient identification number.
*The body is dressed in a simple garment or wrapped in a shroud. An identification label duplicating the above information is pinned to the wrap or shroud.
*A stretcher drawsheet is placed under the body to enable removal to a trolley for transportation to the morgue. These trolleys may often be disguised to resemble laundry carts if transportation has to pass through areas where members of the public may be present.

==Bathing the dead==
'''Washing the body of a dead person''', sometimes as part of a [[religious]] [[ritual]], is a customary [[funerary]] practice in several cultures. It was delegated to professionals in ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, by well-off [[Victorian (era)|Victorians]], and continues so in modern America, but was traditionally performed by "family, friends, and neighbors."&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Quigley|title=The Corpse: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM4BqO68wxEC&amp;pg=PA52|date=1 January 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2449-8|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Bereavement in Judaism}} 
It is part of traditional [[Judaism|Jewish]] burial rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/nyregion/13burial.html|title=Reviving a Ritual of Tending to the Dead|work=The New York Times|date=December 12, 2010|author=Paul Vitello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Inquisition]] in Spain, bodies undergoing preparation for burial were sometimes scrutinized for signs that they had been washed, since this was seen as a marker of secret Jewish practice ([[crypto-Judaism]]).&lt;ref name="Eire2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos M. N. Eire|title=From Madrid to Purgatory: The Art and Craft of Dying in Sixteenth-Century Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEU-Nt9lRdsC&amp;pg=PA86|date=25 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52942-6|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Hinduism===
Bathing of the dead, known as ''yukan'', is also found in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Handbook of Death and Dying | editor1-last = Bryant | editor1-first= Clifton D. | editor-link = Clifton D. Bryant | year = 2003 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | page = 664}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC&amp;pg=PA153|date=10 March 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
It is a religious practice in [[Islam]], where the body is washed by members of the dead person's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/12/AR2010031202891.html|title=The Washing: In the Muslim custom of bathing the dead, she found a deep sense of reward -- and shaved off 40 sins|author=Reshma Memon Yaqub|date= March 21, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, three washings are performed: first with water infused with [[plum]] leaves, then with water infused with [[camphor]], and lastly with purified water.&lt;ref name="Bern-Klug2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mercedes Bern-Klug|title=Transforming Palliative Care in Nursing Homes: The Social Work Role|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtu80unvyV8C&amp;pg=PA262|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50707-3|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The washing is usually performed by others of the same gender, although Islamic [[Hausa people]] permit spouses to wash each other's bodies.&lt;ref name="JosephNaǧmābādī2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suad Joseph|author2=Afsāna Naǧmābādī|title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, Body, Sexuality And Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzXzWgVajnQC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12819-0|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In West Africa===
Funerary bathing is performed in traditional funerals in some countries in [[West Africa]]. The ritual washing of the dead is believed to be one of the factors which resulted in the rapid spread of [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola virus]] in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-ebola-outbreak-so-bad-sierra-leone-emergency-quarantine-180952218/|title=The Difficulty of Burying Ebola's Victims|author=Mary Beth Griggs|date=July 31, 2014|publisher=Smithsonian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] speaks of washing the dead in accordance with the Greek custom, although she was limited to pouring water on the body of her brother [[Polyneikes]].&lt;ref name="Gibbons2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reginald Gibbons|title=Antigone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPI6agP4io0C&amp;pg=PT186|date=26 April 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984020-5|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of bathing the dead has been depicted in a number of films. In the 1995 film ''[[Braveheart]]'', a young [[William Wallace]] watches as women bathe the bodies of his father and brother, who were killed in battle against English troops during the 13th century. The 2009 film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' depicts the washing of a deceased housewife in a Northern German village just before [[World War I]]. In the film ''[[A Midnight Clear]]'' (1992), set in the [[Battle of the Ardennes]] in [[World War II]], a small group of soldiers are able to take a brief respite from the war when they procure a bath tub and heat up some water.  After all have bathed, they wash the body of a comrade who was recently killed while trying to help a unit of German soldiers.

An episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' shows [[Nate Fisher]]'s body being "slowly and methodically" washed by his mother and brother.&lt;ref name="Ashenburg2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Ashenburg|title=The Dirt on Clean: An Unsanitized History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4a7cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4668-6776-5|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="217197">The following tables compare traits given to [[vampires]] in folklore and fiction. Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with [[Varney the Vampire]] and [[Count Dracula]] both bearing protruding teeth,&lt;ref name="Skal99"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|Murnau's]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) the first vampire to be killed by daylight.&lt;ref name="Skal104"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel is the best known vampire fiction of the 19th century, it is the aristocratic figure of [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]] who is thought to have inspired the elegant and suave creature of stage and film.&lt;ref name="Skal75"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright [[Hamilton Deane]] to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.&lt;ref name="Skal62"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.&lt;ref name="SU389"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, ''The Vampire Film'', pp.&amp;nbsp;38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mana''', in [[Austronesian languages]], means "power", "effectiveness", and "prestige". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[Māori language|Māori]], a tribe with ''mana whenua'' must have demonstrated their authority over a territory. In [[Māori culture]], there are two essential aspects of a person's mana: ''mana [[tangata whenua|tangata]]'', authority derived from [[whakapapa]] ([[genealogy]]) and ''mana huaanga'', defined as "authority derived from having a wealth of resources to [[gift economy|gift to others to bind them into reciprocal obligations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Whanganui River report (Wai 167).|date=1999|publisher=GP Publications|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=186956250X|page=35|url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68450539/Whanganui%20River%20Report%201999.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemopereki Simon]], from [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa|Ngati Tuwharetoa]], asserts that there are many forms of mana in Maori culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ojs.aut.ac.nz/te-kaharoa/index.php/tekaharoa/article/view/6/4|title=View of Te Arewhana Kei Roto i Te Rūma: An Indigenous Neo-Disputatio on Settler Society, Nullifying Te Tiriti, ‘Natural Resources’ and Our Collective Future in Aotearoa New Zealand|website=ojs.aut.ac.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous word reflects a non-Western view of reality, complicating translation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469d396b-ce85-4e30-b04f-a39dc8d03f38&amp;chapter=36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102335/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469D396B-CE85-4E30-B04F-A39DC8D03F38&amp;chapter=36 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-20 |title=Waitangi Tribunal |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the definition of mana provided by [[Maori Mardsden]] who states that mana is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Spiritual power and authority as opposed to the purely psychic and natural force — ihi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Te Ao Hurihuri: The World Moves|last=Marsden|first=Māori|publisher=Hicks Smith|year=1975|isbn=|editor-last=King|editor-first=Micheal|location=Wellington|pages=145|chapter=God, Man, and the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Prof. [[Margaret Mutu]] mana in its traditional sense means:&lt;blockquote&gt;Power, authority, ownership, status, influence, dignity, respect derived from the god[/[[atua]]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State of Māori Rights|last=Mutu|first=Margaret|publisher=Huia|year=2011|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of leadership [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] legal scholar [https://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/carwyn-jones Carwyn Jones] comments that, "mana is the central concept that underlies Māori leadership and accountability."

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts they can not easily be translated into a single English definition.

In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mos Teutonicus''' (Latin: ''the Germanic custom'') was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.

== Background ==

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.&lt;ref name= Keen&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0300033605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate.

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scäfer |first1=Von Dietrich |last2= |first2= |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |issue=|pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''mos Teutonicus'', meaning ‘the Germanic custom.’{{#tag:ref|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; |group=note}}

English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of ''mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |issue=|pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;  Embalming and ''mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to [[France]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

== Process ==

The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water or wine&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; for several hours.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with [[salt]] in the same manner as animal meat.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

== Prohibition of the practice ==

Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. This probably hindered the research of some anatomists as they feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies but ''[[De Sepulturis]]'' only prohibited the act of ''mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general.

[[Indigenous peoples of Oceania]] and [[Circumpolar peoples]], and perhaps other populations of [[Asian people|Asiatic]] origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed.&lt;ref name="Gracey1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracey|first=Michael|year=1995|title=New World syndrome in Western Australian aborigines|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=220–225|issn=0305-1870|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01985.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119247811/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and shortened [[life expectancy|life span]].

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

'''Peripeteia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|p|ᵻ|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə}} ({{lang-el|περιπέτεια}}) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature. The Anglicized form of ''peripeteia'' is '''peripety'''.

==Aristotle's view==
[[Aristotle]], in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]], defines peripeteia as "a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity." According to [[Aristotle]], peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to [[drama]], particularly in a [[tragedy]]. He wrote that "The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in [[Oedipus]]...".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Poetics]], 1452a&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery. A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama "Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that" ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity" (1452a 1); in fact, at one point [[Aristotle]] isolates the imitation of "actions that excite pity and fear" as "the distinctive mark of tragic imitation" (1452b 30). Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these "most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist's fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both" (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes [[character arc|changes of character]], but also more external changes.  A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as [[anagnorisis]] or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle's work.

Aristotle considered anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy.  Two such plays are ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', where the oracle's information that Oedipus had killed [[Laius|his father]] and married [[Jocasta|his mother]] brought about his mother's death and his own blindness and exile, and ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' as the principal work demonstrating peripety.  (See Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.)

==Examples==

===''Oedipus Rex''===
In Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage.  In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother.  His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom.  The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, "Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood" (Sophocles 1113).  The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus.  The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta.  Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and [[Anagnorisis|anagnôrisis]] occur at the same time "for the greatest possible impact" because Oedipus has been "struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe" (Winkler 57).

===Conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus===
{{main|Conversion of Paul}}
The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of ''peripeteia'', which [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] presented in his ''Life of Constantine'' as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'' 2010: the ''trope'' of peripaty is discussed in "Constantine's Conversion", pp168f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Three Apples===
In "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her [[infidelity]] and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father's journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the [[tricky slave]] within three days, or else he will have Ja'far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja'far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story's twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution. That was a [[plot twist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10218">{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}The '''portrait''' is a literary [[genre]] derived from pictorial portraiture.

The imitation of [[painting]] is apparent in the name of the genre itself, which is a painting term. Historians of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] recognised the task of the portrait as representation; we find the beginnings of the narrative portrait in [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. However, the portrait began to emerge from the need to describe oneself (self-portrait) or one's contemporaries, as in the ''Essays'' of [[Montaigne]]. This latter work develops a line of questioning around the movement of the representation of the individual (or of a society) from the pictorial mode to the discursive mode.

The portrait can be realised in [[prose]] or in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. Its objectives vary according to context: sociocultural, sociopolitical, historical, or again according to the subjectivity of the portraitist (the writer). Thus one can speak of a fictional portrait (corresponding to the characters who populate the fictional universe of each [[author]]) as much as a realist one (representing real-life people).

The portrait oscillates between [[reality]] and [[fiction]], between [[eulogy]] and [[satire]], between one portrait which imitates its original and another which moves away from it (such as the [[caricatures]] found in newspapers or in [[Molière]]). Nevertheless, the objective portrait which describes the flaws and qualities of the individual represented (or equally the object or the idea) is quite widespread. The literary portrait evolved through the centuries and its development has been shaped by writers as well as literary critics and theorists.

== The portrait in the seventeenth century ==
It is from the 1650s that the portrait began to be defined as a literary genre. It is through the social innovations of the ''précieuses'' - such as [[La Grande Mademoiselle]] who, influenced by the portrait-laden works of [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], gathered around her (as a ''salonnière'' or ‘salon hostess’) men of letters - that the portrait was transformed into a ‘diversion of society’.

The literary portrait held to the essential aesthetic rules of the pictorial mode - that is, it had to describe the individual (model) faithfully in order to disguinguish it as a type apart. Nevertheless, it was not to be inferred from the recognition of the individual represented, but rather from the portraitist's style. This narrative representation had the function of highlighting fixed and timeless physical and mental features, as one sees in the works of Molière or in the ''Caractères'' by [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. It had to be achieved through layers of successive description - as in painting - which were only distinct phrases describing the real model's features.

== The portrait in the eighteenth century ==
The Age of Enlightenment heralded a new phase in the development of the literary portrait. It invaded literature and even contaminated music. [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]] excelled in this genre. Nevertheless, the portrait carried more of the psychology of the model represented than his or her physical appearance.

In [[Denis Diderot]], it is precisely the pictorial portrait that is the occasion of a narrative self-portrait effected in the form of an artistic critique of the paintings and statues which were made of him. Thus he did not like the painting by [[Louis Michel van Loo]] portraying him:

{{Quote
|''Quite alive; it’s his gentleness, with his vivacity; but too young, head too small, pretty like a woman, ogling, smiling, cute, giving a small kiss, affected mouth […] Sparkling close up, vigorous from afar, especially the skin. Besides, well-modelled beautiful hands, except the left, which is not drawn. We see it from the front; his head is bare; his grey tufts, with his preciousness, gives him the appearance of an old coquette who is still loveable; the position of a secretary of state and not a philosopher. The falsity of the first moment influenced everything else.''
}}
The philosopher blamed the painter's wife for having prevented him from being himself: “It is this madwoman, madame Van Loo, who had come to gossip with him while he was being painted, who gave him that air, and who spoiled everything.” Diderot took to imagining what his portrait would have been like: 
{{Quote
|''If she had taken to her [[harpsichord]] and improvised, or sung''

Non ha ragione, ingrate,
Un core abbandonato

''or some other piece of the same genre, the sensitive philosopher would have taken an altogether different character; and the portrait would have been effective. Or better still he had been left alone and abandoned to his reverie. So would the mouth have been ajar, his distracted looks would have been carried away, the inner workings of his head would have been painted on his face, and Michel would have done a beautiful thing.''
}}
After criticizing the portrait that portrays him, he writes:
{{Quote
|''But what will my little children say when they come to compare my sad works with that laughing, cute, effeminate old flirt there?'' 
}}
He informs them, “My children, I tell you that it is not me,” and undertakes to trace in writing the real portrait of himself:
{{Quote
|''I had in one day a hundred different physiognomies, according to the thing by which I was affected. I was serene, sad, dreamy, tender, violent, passionate, enthusiastic; but I was never such as you see me there. I had a large forehead, very lively eyes, broad features, a head quite like an ancient orator, a ''bonhomie'' that touched very closely the stupidity and rustic character of former times. Without the exaggeration of all the features in the engraving made from Greuze’s pencil, I would have been infinitely better. I have a mask that deceives the artist; either there is too much melted together or the impressions of my soul succeed each other very quickly and paint themselves all over my face: the eye of the painter does not find me the same from one moment to the other; his task becomes much more difficult than he had believed it to be.'' 
}}
According to Diderot, only one painter managed to make a pictorial portrait of him in which he recognizes himself and that is [[Jean-Baptiste Garand]]: by an apparent irony of fate, this success was the result of chance: 
{{Quote
|''It never was done well save by a poor devil named Garand, who caught me, as happens to a fool who says a good word. Whoever sees my portrait by Garand, sees me.'' Ecco il vero Pulcinella.
}}
Moreover, the semi-private sphere of correspondence also allowed the sketching of portraits in principle intended solely for the use of the recipient of the letter. Thus, [[Marie Du Deffand]], taking the thermal waters at [[Forges-les-Eaux]], was able to draw a sharp and cheerful portrait of [[Madame de Pecquigny]], the companion that fate had assigned her during her treatment: 
{{Quote
|''La Pecquigny is no resource, and her spirit is like space; there is no extension, depth, and perhaps all the other dimensions that I can not say, because I do not know them; but this is only empty for use. She has felt everything, judged everything, tested everything, chosen everything, rejected everything; she is, she says, a singular difficulty in company, and yet all day long she jabbers with our little ladies like a magpie.''
}}
However, it is not so much her spirit - or the way she uses it - that irritates Marie Du Deffand as the woman's quirks:
{{Quote
|''But that’s not what I do not like about her. It’s convenient for me today and it will be very pleasant for me as soon as Forment arrives. What is unbearable to me is dinner. She looks crazy while eating; she breaks up a chicken in the dish where it is served, then she puts it in another, has brought broth to put on it, just like the one she makes, and then she takes a wing, then the body, of which she only eats half, and then she does not want us to turn the calf to cut a bone, lest we soften the skin; she cuts a bone with all possible pain, she gnaws half of it, then returns to her hen; it lasts two hours. She has on her plate heaps of gnawed bones, of sucked skins, and, during that time, either I am bored to death or I eat more than I should. It is a curious thing to see her eat a biscuit; it lasts half an hour and the fact of the matter is that she eats like a wolf. It truly is an enraging exercise.''
}}
Marie Du Deffand completes this portrait of an eccentric by linking her to her interlocutor: “I am sorry that you have in common with her the impossibility of staying a minute at rest.” After which she concludes, in accordance with the philosophy of resignation and disinterest she defends, the temporary nature of that which she will have to endure on this “holiday meeting”: 
{{Quote
|''Finally - do you want me to tell you? She is no less amiable. She has no doubt of her wit. But all this is poorly digested, and I do not think it is worth more. She lives comfortably, but I would challenge her to be difficult with me. I submit to all her whims because she does nothing to me. Our present union will be of no consequence for the future.''
}}

== The portrait of the nineteenth century ==
The evolution of the narrative portrait did not stop at the nineteenth century but, on the contrary, it became more refined and took on nuances through the intervention of [[Sainte-Beuve]] in the works or the critiques of such literary portraits.

In fact, the portrait found a true place in the novel where it represented not only real-life individuals but also fictional individuals (who could also be symbolic). It is in this way that the portrait became a predominant and recurring theme in the work of [[Balzac]].

== The portrait of the twentieth century ==
The portrait continued its journey throughout the twentieth century with the modern novel. In [[Nathalie Sarraute]] (in the Portrait d'un inconnu) the features are not fixed, the temporality plays its role in the genre of the moving portrait, progressive, fragmented, as in the life of a human.

{{Violence against women}}
'''''Raptio''''' (in [[Archaic English|archaic]] or [[literary English]] rendered as '''''rape''''') is a [[Latin]] term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. [[kidnapping]] for [[marriage]] or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The equivalent term '''''Frauenraub''''', originally from [[German language|German]], is used in English in the field of [[art history]].

[[Bride kidnapping]] is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.

{{Wiktionary|rape}}

==Terminology==
The English word ''rape'' retains the Latin meaning in [[literary language]], but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of "sexual violation". The word is akin to ''rapine'', ''[[rapture]]'', ''[[wikt:raptor|raptor]]'', ''rapacious'' and ''ravish'', and referred to the more general violations, such as [[looting]], destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during [[war]], e.g. the [[Rape of Nanking]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the definition "the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force" besides the more general "the act of taking anything by force" (marked as ''obsolete'') and the more specific "violation or ravishing of a woman".

English ''rape'' was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an [[Old French]] legal term for "to seize", in turn from [[Latin]] ''rapere'' "seize, carry off by force, abduct". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as "[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).

Though the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word "rape" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', the title means "the theft of a lock [of hair]", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the word with its old meaning of "seizing and taking away" in his ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]] ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' has [[The Fantasticks#Controversy|a controversial song]] ("It Depends on What You Pay") about "an old-fashioned rape". Compare also the adjective "rapacious" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of rape}}

The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the [[nubile]] females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122819/http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduction of women is a common practice in [[tribal warfare|warfare]] among [[tribal societies]], along with [[cattle raiding]]. In [[historical human migrations]], the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s compared to [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s. 
[[Image:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Rape of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], Rome, 1637-38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
The [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] is an important part of the [[Founding of Rome|foundation legends]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (8th century BC). [[Romulus]] had established the settlement on the [[Palatine Hill]] with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the [[Sabines]], without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. [[Livy]] claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, "and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html Livy: The Rape of the Sabines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311040505/http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer [[Saki]] in ''The Schartz-Metterklume Method''.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as the main plot of the movie [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'']].

In [[Sanskrit literature]], the practice is known as ''[[Rakshasa]] Vivaha'' ("devil marriage"), mentioned e.g. by [[Kautilya]]. It is one of the eight forms of [[Hindu marriage]], the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives ([[Manu Smrti]] 3.33).

In the 3rd century, [[Gothic Christianity]] appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the [[Goths]] in [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]]: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor [[Decius]], and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf, ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen'' (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam]] is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law]] ([[Sura 4]]:25).

Mutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the [[Balkans under Ottoman rule]], and is a frequent theme in the [[Hajduk]] songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. Simiczijev, ''Pieśń hajducka Słowian południowych'' ("the Hajduk songs of the South Slavs") 1985; review by Christo Vasilev, Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Setting is an important element in a narrative and in some works the setting becomes a character itself. The term setting is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[novelist]] [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pp.110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.

==Types==
Setting may take various forms:
* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]
* [[Dystopia]]
* [[Fantasy world]]
* [[Fictional city]]
* [[Fictional country]]
* [[Fictional crossover]]
* [[Fictional location]]
* [[Fictional universe]]
* [[Future history]]
* [[Imaginary world]]
* [[Mythical place]]
* [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]]
* [[Planets in science fiction]]
* [[Simulated reality]]
* [[Virtual reality]]
* [[Utopia]]

The '''sociology of culture''', and the related cultural sociology, concerns the systematic analysis of [[culture]], usually understood as the ensemble of symbolic codes used by a members of a society, as it is manifested in the society. For [[Georg Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Culture in the sociological field is analyzed as the ways of thinking and describing, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life.

Contemporary sociologists' approach to culture is often divided between a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not interchangeable.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sociology of culture'' is an older concept, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. By way of contrast, [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]] introduced the term ''cultural sociology'', an approach that sees all, or most, [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] as inherently cultural at some level.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology|publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu|accessdate=2014-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|archivedate=2015-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a leading proponent of the "[[Strong programme|strong program]]" in cultural sociology, Alexander argues: "To believe in the possibility of cultural sociology is to subscribe to the idea that every action, no matter how instrumental, reflexive, or coerced [compared to] its external environment, is embedded to some extent in a horizon of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology By Jeffrey C. Alexander https://books.google.com/books?id=CIA3AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=csNoAH4xzN&amp;dq=%22cultural%20turn%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of analysis, sociology of culture often attempts to explain some discretely cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a component of explanations of social phenomena.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|author1=Griswold, W.|author2=Carroll, C.|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412990547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the field of [[cultural studies]], cultural sociology does not reduce all human matters to a problem of cultural encoding and decoding. For instance, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s cultural sociology has a "clear recognition of the social and the economic as categories which are interlinked with, but not reducible to, the cultural."&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." The Sociological Review 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar, Germany]], where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. In the beginning of the cultural turn, sociologists tended to use qualitative methods and hermeneutic approaches to research, focusing on meanings, words, artifacts and symbols. "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including historically quantitative and model-based subfields, such as [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]].

===Early researchers===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology, as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]], and with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]] where researchers pioneered [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field is still felt in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative) in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities) and substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Karl Marx}}
As a major contributor to [[conflict theory]], Marx argued that culture served to justify inequality. The ruling class, or the [[bourgeoisie]], produce a culture that promotes their interests, while repressing the interests of the [[proletariat]]. His most famous line to this effect is that "Religion is the [[opium of the people]]". Marx believed that the "engine of history" was the struggle between groups of people with diverging economic interests and thus the economy determined the cultural [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of [[values]] and [[ideologies]]. For this reason, Marx is a considered a ''[[materialist]]'' as he believes that the economic (material) produces the cultural (ideal), which "stands [[Hegel]] on his head,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/calhoun.jackson.theory/papers/A--MarxGeneral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who argued the ideal produced the material.

====Émile Durkheim====
{{Main|Émile Durkheim}}
Durkheim held the belief that culture has many relationships to society which include:
* ''Logical'' – Power over individuals belongs to certain cultural categories, and beliefs such as in God.
* ''Functional –'' Certain rites and myths create and build up social order by having more people create strong beliefs. The greater the number of people who believe strongly in these myths more will the social order be strengthened.
* ''Historical –'' Culture had its origins in society, and from those experiences came evolution into things such as classification systems.

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Max Weber}}
Weber innovated the idea of a [[status group]] as a certain type of subculture. Status groups are based on things such as: race, ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, gender, sexual preference, etc. These groups live a certain lifestyle based on different values and norms. They are a culture within a culture, hence the label subculture. Weber also purported the idea that people were motivated by their material and ideal interests, which include things such as preventing one from going to hell. Weber also explains that people use symbols to express their spirituality, that symbols are used to express the spiritual side of real events, and that ideal interests are derived from symbols.

====Georg Simmel====
{{Main|Georg Simmel}}
For Simmel, culture refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel presented his analyses within a context of "form" and "content". Sociological concept and analysis can be viewed.

==The elements of culture==
'''1. Symbols:''' Any thing that carries particular meaning recognized by people who share the same culture.&lt;ref name=gerber&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gerber, John J., and Linda M. Macionis |title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=59–65|edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Language:''' A system of symbols that allows people to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''3. Values:''' Culturally defined standards of desirability, goodness, beauty and many other things that serves as broad guidelines for social living.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''4. Beliefs:''' Specific statements that people hold to be true.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''5. [[Social norm|Norms]]:''' Rules and expectations by which a society guides the behaviour of its members. The two types of norms are mores and folkways. '''[[Mores]]''' are norms that are widely observed and have a great moral significance. '''Folkways''' are norms for routine, casual interaction.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''6. Behavioral patterns:''' The typical manner in which people perform production (e.g., manual, manufactured, automated in various degrees), communicate (e.g., language content, technology choices), mark significant events (e.g., rituals of endorsing values and of punctuating steps in personal life), satisfy basic needs (e.g., for dwelling, feeding, security, sex, reproduction, entertainment), and the like.

'''7. Artifacts:''' Distinct material objects, such as architecture, technologies, and artistic creations.

'''8.  Social institutions:''' Patterns of organization and relationships regarding governance, production, socializing, education, knowledge creation, arts, and relating to other cultures.

==Anthropology==
In an anthropological sense, culture is society based on the values and ideas without influence of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The cultural system is the cognitive and symbolic matrix for the central values system|sign=[[Talcott Parsons]]|source=}}

Culture is like the shell of a lobster. Human nature is the organism living inside of that shell. The shell, culture, identifies the organism, or human nature. Culture is what sets human nature apart, and helps direct the life of human nature.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] lay claim to the establishment of modern uses of the culture concept as defined by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in the mid-19th century.

===Bronisław Malinowski===
{{Main|Bronisław Malinowski}}
Malinowski collected data from the [[Trobriand Islands]]. Descent groups across the island claim parts of the land, and to back up those claims, they tell myths of how an ancestress started a clan and how the clan descends from that ancestress. Malinowski's observations followed the research of that found by Durkheim.

===Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown===
{{Main|Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown}}
Radcliffe-Brown put himself in the culture of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman Islanders]]. His research showed that group solidification among the islanders is based on music and kinship, and the rituals that involve the use of those activities. In the words of Radcliffe-Brown, "Ritual fortifies Society".

===Marcel Mauss===
{{Main|Marcel Mauss}}
Marcel Mauss made many comparative studies on religion, magic, law and morality of occidental and non-occidental societies, and developed the concept of [[total social fact]], and argued that the reciprocity is the universal logic of the cultural interaction.

===Claude Lévi-Strauss===
{{Main|Claude Lévi-Strauss}}
Lévi-Strauss, based, at the same time, on the sociological and anthropological [[positivism]] of Durkheim, Mauss, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, on the economic and sociological [[marxism]], on [[freudian]] and [[Gestalt psychology]] and on [[structural linguistics]] of Saussure and Jakobson, realized great studies on areas myth, kinship, religion, ritual, symbolism, magic, [[ideology]] (souvage pensée), knowledge, art and aesthetics, applying the [[methodological structuralism]] on his investigations. He searched the universal principals of human thought as a form of explaining social behaviors and structures.

==Major areas of research==

===Theoretical constructs in Bourdieu's sociology of culture===
French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s influential model of society and social relations has its roots in [[Marxist theorists|Marxist theories]] of [[Marxian class theory|class]] and [[Social conflict theory|conflict]]. Bourdieu characterizes social relations in the context of what he calls the ''[[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]'', defined as a competitive system of social relations functioning according to its own specific logic or rules. The ''field'' is the site of struggle for power between the dominant and subordinate classes. It is within the ''field'' that [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimacy]]—a key aspect defining the dominant class—is conferred or withdrawn.

Bourdieu's theory of practice is practical rather than [[Discursive psychology|discursive]], embodied as well as cognitive and durable though adaptive. A valid concern that sets the agenda in Bourdieu's [[Practice theory|theory of practice]] is how action follows regular statistical patterns without the product of accordance to rules, norms and/or conscious intention. To explain this concern, Bourdieu explains [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and [[field (Bourdieu)|field]]. Habitus explains the mutually penetrating realities of individual subjectivity and societal objectivity after the function of social construction. It is employed to transcend the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] dichotomy.

===Cultural change===
{{Further|Trans-cultural diffusion}}
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. [[Resistance (psychoanalysis)|Resistance]] can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.

[[Culture change|Cultural change]] can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures.

Several understandings of how cultures change come from anthropology. For instance, in diffusion theory, the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] but has diffused to numerous cultures. Its original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[New Age religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces. A variant of the diffusion theory, [[stimulus diffusion]], refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention in another.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many [[Native American Indians]]. Related processes on an individual level are [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change. Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals – which, for certain elements of cultural change, is true – but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture. The author presents a [[sociological perspective]] to address this conflict.

Sociology suggests an alternative to both the view that it has always been an unsatisfying way  at one extreme and the sociological individual genius view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations. We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p.&amp;nbsp;53)
In short, Griswold argues that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture. The logic is a bit circular, but illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, "there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was"). Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society. This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue. Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural). Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend). Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning. This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do. Cultural change, on the other hand, is a matter that can be questioned and researched, as Griswold does.

===Culture theory===
[[Culture theory]], developed in the 1980s and 1990s, sees audiences as playing an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media. One strand of research focuses on the audiences and how they interact with media; the other strand of research focuses on those who produce the media, particularly the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|title=The Role and Influence of Mass Media|last=|first=|date=|website=Cliffs Notes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821005211/http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-mediated communication as culture===
{{Main|Computer-mediated communication}}

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the process of sending messages—primarily, but not limited to text messages—through the direct use by participants of computers and communication networks. By restricting the definition to the direct use of computers in the communication process, you have to get rid of the communication technologies that rely upon computers for switching technology (such as telephony or compressed video), but do not require the users to interact directly with the computer system via a keyboard or similar computer interface. To be mediated by computers in the sense of this project, the communication must be done by participants fully aware of their interaction with the computer technology in the process of creating and delivering messages. Given the current state of computer communications and networks, this limits CMC to primarily text-based messaging, while leaving the possibility of incorporating sound, graphics, and video images as the technology becomes more sophisticated.

===Cultural institutions===
{{Main|Cultural Institutions Studies}}
Cultural activities are institutionalised; the focus on institutional settings leads to the investigation "of activities in the cultural sector, conceived as historically evolved societal forms of organising the conception, production, distribution, propagation, interpretation, reception, conservation and maintenance of specific cultural goods".&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Tasos (2004): Kulturbetriebslehre. Begründung einer Inter-Disziplin. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Institutions Studies is therefore a specific approach within the sociology of culture.

{{Linguistics}}

'''Speech''' is human vocal [[communication]] using [[language]]. Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[Speech_act|speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation_(linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[Loudness|loudness]], [[Tempo|tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent_(sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol_intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[Trance|trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.  

Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[Prayer|prayer]] or in [[Meditation|meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[Mantra|mantra]]).

Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]].  
Speech compares with [[written language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]]. 

The evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[Sign_language|sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

== Production ==
{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}

Speech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|date=|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Kieth|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425–442|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.

Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}

Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11–46|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|date=|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–490|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|pages=185–238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|date=|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition==
{{main|Speech repetition}}

In speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems involving speech==
{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}

There are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:

#Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.
#Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.
#Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.
#Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].
#In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.

==Brain physiology==

=== The classical model ===
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]

The classical or [[Wernicke–Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2005). "Wernicke--GeschwindModel". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hillis, A. E., &amp; Caramazza, A. (2005). "Aphasia". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to)|publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co|year=1995|isbn=90-272-1893-5|volume=4|location=Amsterdam|pages=69–89|chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875)|author=Wernicke K.|editor=Paul Eling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or [[receptive aphasia]], which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or [[Jargon aphasia|jargon speech]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern research ===
Modern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. &lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension. Damage to the left [[lateral sulcus]] has been connected with difficulty in processing and producing morphology and syntax, while lexical access and comprehension of irregular forms (e.g. eat-ate) remain unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of Speech: from sound to meaning.|last=Tyler|first=Lorraine K.|last2=Marslen-Wilson|first2=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-956131-5|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brian C.

Moreover, the circuits involved in human speech comprehension dynamically adapt with learning, for example, by becoming more efficient in terms of processing time when listening to familiar messages such as learned verses&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Site description==

===Ownership===
TV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym "Fast Eddie", who described himself as having become interested in the conventions of [[genre fiction]] while studying at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |title=Behind The Wiki: Meet TV Tropes Cofounder Fast Eddie |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083524/https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |archivedate=February 27, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 the site is privately owned and the site publicly lists two co-owners besides Eddie.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=April 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421145813/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |archivedate=April 21, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
Initially focused on the television show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref name="MarySue"/&gt; TV Tropes has since increased its scope to include television series, [[film]]s, [[novel]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[professional wrestling]], [[video game]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[comic strip]]s/[[comic book|books]], [[fan fiction]], and many other subjects, including Internet works such as [[Wikipedia]] (referred to in-wiki as "The Other Wiki").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |title=Wikipedia - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025202729/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life, or point out real situations where certain tropes can be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have [[notability]] standards for the works it covers.&lt;ref name="Notability"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |title=There Is No Such Thing As Notability - TV Tropes |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkCvpC?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article organization===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The site includes entries on various series and tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes|title=Tropes - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on a work includes a brief summary of the work in question along with a list of associated tropes. Trope pages are the reverse of articles on works: they give a description of the trope itself, then provide a list of the trope's appearances in various works of media. In this way TV Tropes is fully interconnected through the various connections made between the works and their tropes.

For example, the trope "I Am Spartacus" is a specific type of scene that appears in multiple works. It refers to scenes where a character is shielded from identification by other characters who are also claiming to be that particular character. The trope name references a famous scene in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I Am Spartacus |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=September 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907080917/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |archivedate=September 7, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is included, along with examples from ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', the [[Talmud]] and even recent stories from real life. Not all examples of a trope may be cases where it is "played straight". They may also include cases where the trope is parodied, played with, inverted or even averted (i.e. avoided altogether in a context where it would be expected).

In addition to the tropes, most articles about a work also have a "Your Mileage May Vary"&lt;ref name="mileage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HomePage |title=Your Mileage May Vary - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903082355/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HoMepage |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (YMMV) page with items that are deemed to be subjective. These items are not usually storytelling tropes, but are audience reactions which have been defined and titled. For example, the page of the well known trope "[[jumping the shark]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark|title=Jumping the Shark - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the moment at which a series experiences a sharp decline in quality as in the notorious story point in ''[[Happy Days]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays|title=Happy Days (Series) - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; only contains a list of works that reference the phrase. TV Tropes does not apply the term to a show, that being a subjective opinion about the show, but cites uses of the phrase by the show ("in-universe"). Most articles also have various pages within them. For example, the article may have an "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/sugarwiki/momentofawesome?from=main.crowningmomentofawesome|title=Moment of Awesome / Sugar Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page to describe crowning moments of awesome (i.e., a moment in a show or other fictional work that the majority of the readers or viewers regard as one of the high points); a "Fridge" page which describes examples of the tropes "Fridge Logic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic|title=Fridge Logic - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (issues of a given work's internal consistency that do not typically occur to one until later), as well as the related "Fridge Horror"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror|title=Fridge Horror - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Fridge Brilliance";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance|title=Fridge Brilliance - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "Laconic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaconicWiki|title=Laconic Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page which describes an article/trope in a few short words; and more pages that focus on a particular aspect of an article/item.

===Trope descriptions===
Trope description pages are generally created through a standardized launching system, known as the "Trope Launch Pad" (TLP, formerly "You Know That Thing Where" [YKTTW]); site members, (referred to as "Tropers"), can draft a trope description and have the option of providing examples or suggesting refinements to other drafts before launch. While going through TLP is not necessary to launch a trope, it is strongly recommended in order to strengthen the trope as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |title=TLP Guidelines |accessdate=October 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |archivedate=October 3, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has created its own self-referencing meta-trope, known as "TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life". The trope warns that some readers may become jaded and cynical as an unanticipated side effect of reading TV Tropes, "[replacing] surprise almost entirely with recognition,"  referring to the inability to read books, watch films, etc. without identifying each trope as it occurs. Also mentioned is that many frequently-contributing community members self-describe themselves as addicted to the site. The community has dubbed the pattern of many tropers as taking a "Wiki Walk," starting an edit on an intended article, and subsequently following links from one page to the next for hours on end without intending to, pausing occasionally to add examples the troper notices to the listings or rework articles. In the process, this leads to the discovery of entirely new tropes to analyze, edit, and add examples to. This self-perpetuating cycle of behavior has become the subject of much lampooning for the community, with tongue-in-cheek references being made in the articles for tropes such as "[[Brainwashing]]," "Hive Mind," and ''Tome of Eldritch Lore'' (a book of cursed knowledge which infects the reader with obsessive madness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |title=TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkhf0z?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding scope===
Considerable redesign of some aspects of content organization occurred in 2008, such as the introduction of [[namespace]]s, while 2009 saw the arrival of other languages, [[German language|German]] being the most developed. In 2011, TV Tropes branched out into video production, and launched ''Echo Chamber'', a web series about a TV Tropes [[vlog]]ger explaining and demonstrating tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |title=Echo Chamber |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901055445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |archivedate=September 1, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, [[Gawker Media]]'s blog ''[[io9]]'' described the tone of contributions to the site as "often light and funny". [[Cyberpunk]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] once described its style as a "wry [[fan fiction|fanfic]] analysis".&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Sterling |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |title=TV Tropes, the all-devouring pop-culture wiki |publisher=WIRED |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312063723/https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist Linda Börzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing [[Trope (literature)|recurring elements]] from creative works in an ironic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Börzsei |first=Linda |title=Literary Criticism in New Media |website=Academia.edu |date=April 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |accessdate=September 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171506/https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Robin Hanson]], inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature,&lt;ref name=epjournal&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |format=PDF |author=Kruger, Daniel et. al. |year=2006 |title=Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023074308/https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction - a prime opportunity for research into its nature.&lt;ref name=overcomingbias&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanson |first=Robin |url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |title=Tropes Are Treasures |publisher=Overcoming Bias |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020232952/https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |archivedate=October 20, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lifehacker]], Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to [[Wikipedia]], recommending to "use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Nick |url=https://lifehacker.com/use-the-tv-tropes-site-the-same-way-you-would-wikipedia-1822930619 |title=Use the TV Tropes Site the Same Way You Would Wikipedia |work=Lifehacker |date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Mature content incident===
In October 2010, in what the site refers to as "The Google Incident", [[Google]] temporarily withdrew its [[AdSense]] service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |title=Administrivia: The Google Incident |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516034226/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |archivedate=May 16, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/adsense/i-dont-yet-have-an-account-getting-approved/T7-CeRf60B0 |title=Google Groups |website=productforums.google.com|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and [[rape]] tropes. Feminist blog ''The Mary Sue'' criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in [[sexism in video games|video games]] and [[young adult fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |title=TV Tropes Deletes Every Rape Trope; Geek Feminism Wiki steps in |publisher=themarysue.com |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Aja Romano |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423223946/https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for "providing a financial disincentive to discuss" such topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |title=TV Tropes Bows to Google’s Ad Servers, Deletes Discussions of Sexual Assault in Culture |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Alyssa Rosenberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121952/https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site now separates NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"/&gt;

Regarding these and other concerns of re-licensing and advertising, a wiki called All The Tropes [[Fork (software development)|fork]]ed all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC-BY-SA license in late 2013.

'''''The Encyclopaedia Sinica''''' is a 1917 [[English language|English-language]] [[encyclopedia]] on [[China]] and China-related subjects [[editing|edit]]ed by [[English people|English]] [[missionary]] [[Samuel Couling]]. It covers a range of topics and provides insight on early 20th century perspectives towards China. Commentators{{who|date=February 2012}} report that the work is still useful at the turn of the 21st century particularly to aid the understanding of the relationship between [[Anglo-Chinese relations|China and the United Kingdom]].

'''Tour-realism''' (T.R.) is a new trend in [[alternative tourism]]. It differs from both [[mass tourism]] and "independent tourism", a type of tourism involving absolutely no mediators in the tour organization. 
 
T.R. operators usually represent the country they live and work in. T.R. operators are known for having advanced knowledge of the culture and history of their country, as well as for having tight and constant connections with local population. Because they are residents of the country, T.R. operators are capable of providing unique services for foreign guests.

== Characteristics ==
Tour-realism, as a tourism subgenre, tends to have certain defining characteristics. Tour-realism is generally done in small groups of 3-5 persons, usually family members or groups of friends. The approach is individualized (not reliant on standard itineraries) and focuses on high-quality offerings, with  flexible choice of apartments and [[excursions]] that depend on the demands and wishes of the client. Accommodations are most often private villas, cottages etc., with an emphasis on creating an ''authentic'' experience as befits the culture and locale, again dependent on the wishes of the client. "Extras" in terms of excursions and services are built-in to create a personalized, unique experience for the client, and outings will include both the well-known and the obscure.

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9476">''' Trash Doves ''' is an [[Internet meme]] which originated from a sticker set designed in 2016, which feature a large-eyed purple pigeon in various situations. The most notable sticker of the set is an animated [[GIF]] of the bird vigorously thrashing its head up and down. Shortly after its debut on Facebook in January 2017, the purple dove sticker set quickly became a viral subject of [[Photo manipulation|edited]] parodies and image macros on the social media.

==History==
===Origin and release===
Syd Weiler, a [[Sarasota, Florida]]-based artist and [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Adobe Creative]] resident, first made her dove sticker set for the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] in September 2016.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Cresci|first=Elena|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/trash-dove-how-a-purple-bird-took-over-facebook|title=Trash dove: how a purple bird took over Facebook|work=The Guardian|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petramala2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Petramala|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/trash-dove-created-by-sarasota-artist-goes-viral-on-facebook/408803838|title=Trash Dove' created by Sarasota artist goes viral|work=WTSP|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiler described her visit to [[Minneapolis]] as inspiration for the illustrations, stating, "I was sitting by a pond ... and there were just pigeons everywhere, I had never thought about pigeons before. They're funny little birds. They have really shiny, colorful, almost rainbow-y feathers, but then they bob around and waddle and beg for food. They're like doves but they eat trash."&lt;ref name=Gilmer2017/&gt;

Weiler streamed the entire process of creating the stickers on her [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] channel.&lt;ref name=Kircher2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Kircher|first=Madison Malone|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/02/what-is-trash-dove-the-purple-facebook-comment-sticker-bird.html|title=Introducing Trash Dove: The Floppy-Necked Purple Bird Taking Over Facebook|work=Select All|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]''|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sticker set's illustrations feature a purple pigeon in various situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-38967825|title=What does this purple bird mean?|work=BBC|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after her Twitch stream, the stickers were released onto the [[IOS 10|iOS10]] [[iMessage]] Sticker store.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt;

In December 2016, [[Facebook]] approached Weiler, asking to license the dove artwork for their [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]] app.&lt;ref name=Petramala2017/&gt; It officially made its Facebook debut on January 31, 2017, which included the animated sticker of a head banging pigeon.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Nithya|url=http://www.india.com/buzz/trash-dove-is-internets-new-obsession-and-it-is-spamming-people-all-over-on-facebook-1840297/|title=Trash Dove is internet's new obsession and it is spamming people all over on Facebook|work=[[Penske Media Corporation|India.com]]|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Facebook, the stickers are used in the same way [[emojis]] are used, either through the Messenger app or on a comment section.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; The stickers are also available on [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]].

===Virality and use as a meme===
On February 7, 2017, a Thai [[Facebook]] page posted a video that included a fusion of the headbanging dove from the sticker set, and a dancing cat.&lt;ref name=Tiffany2017/&gt; The video garnered over 3.5 million views in just a few days.&lt;ref name=Kircher2017/&gt;  Weiler responded to the video stating, "I thought it was really funny. At that point, there's not much I can do about it but laugh."&lt;ref name=Gilmer2017/&gt; In Thailand, the usage of the meme was described by Sarasota's local media as "a sort of cultural joke".&lt;ref name=Petramala2017/&gt; The Thai newspaper ''[[Khao Sod]]'' also noted that the Thai word for "bird", "nok", is also used to describe someone who is "hopelessly single or suffering from unrequited love", adding to its humor.&lt;ref name=Thaitrakulpanich2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Thaitrakulpanich|first=Asaree|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/culture/net/2017/02/11/thainet-flips-headbanging-bird/|title=Thainet Flips Out Over Headbanging Bird|work=Khao Sod|date=February 11, 2017|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracy2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Phillip N.|url=http://www.dailydot.com/debug/trash-dove-purple-bird-facebook/|title=What is Trash Dove, and can Facebook do anything to stop it?|work=The Daily Dot|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following weekend, the headbanging bird began to spread to English-language users, who [[spamming|spammed]] Facebook comment sections with the sticker.&lt;ref name=Petramala2017/&gt;

The meme found its way outside of Facebook, being used on other social media websites such as [[YouTube]], in addition to the online comment sections of news outlets such as the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Nickoloff2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Nickoloff|first=Anne|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/02/facebook_sticker_trash_dove_fl.html|title=Facebook sticker "Trash Dove" floods comment conversations on social media|work=cleveland.com|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmer2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmer|first=Marcus|url=http://mashable.com/2017/02/14/trash-dove-meme/#8U0LeCU_XPqw|title=Where the hell did this head-banging purple bird meme even come from|work=Mashable|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Internet users have created Trash Dove fan art, as well as reworked the image of the head banging dove into other memes, such as [[Salt Bae]].&lt;ref name=Kircher2017/&gt; 

Similarly to [[Pepe the Frog]], some users of the imageboard [[4chan]] began to propose that the purple dove become a symbol of the [[alt-right]], producing images of the dove combined with [[Nazi]] iconography, and interpreting it as a reincarnation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] dubbed "Pek" (a pun of the Egyptian god [[Kek (mythology)#In popular culture|Kek]], who was associated with Pepe).&lt;ref name=Hathaway2017/&gt; ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted that "Like a lot of things on 4chan, it's hard to tell if this whole thing is satirical. The most likely case is that, like the white supremacist tendencies on the site, it started out as a joke but eventually turned real. Posters on liberal Facebook groups are alarmed by the bird spam—most of which is totally innocent, carried out by mainstream Facebook 'normies'—and have decided that any use of the bird is subtle fascist propaganda."&lt;ref name=Hathaway2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Hathaway|first=Jay|url=http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/trash-dove-purple-bird-alt-right-meme/|title=A meme war is raging over the future of Trash Dove|work=The Daily Dot|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
When the sticker set was propelled to its meme status in February 2017, it was generally met with positive reception. Weiler commented, "The cultural crossover is totally unanticipated, but it's bringing a lot of joy," adding "I'm all about the positive. I created these to make people smile, so whenever I see people sharing Trash Dove I get really excited. I'm glad people can appropriate that."&lt;ref name=Bergado2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergado|first=Gabe|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/27840-trash-dove-facebook-bird-pigeon-sticker-thailand-syd-weiler|title=Meet Trash Dove, the Facebook Bird Going Viral and Sparking Memes|work=Inverse|date=February 14, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weiler has also expressed, "I'm a quiet homebody – I like to sit at my desk and draw, and play video games. Overnight, I was flooded with attention, and that has only sped up for five days now [...], I'm amazed at how mean people can be to someone they've never met, because of something silly online. I didn't ask for or sign up for any of this, but many people are blaming me, and I've even received some threats."&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; 

Kaitlyn Tiffany of ''[[The Verge]]'' opined that the birds in the sticker set are "cuties".&lt;ref name=Tiffany2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiffany|first=Kaitlyn|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/13/14601122/trash-doves-meme-facebook-sticker-set|title=This very distressed purple bird is derailing conversations across Facebook|work=The Verge|date=February 13, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the meme rose to popularity, Madison Malone Kircher of [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' Magazine]] detailed, "since it's been about a week since Trash Dove rose to internet fame, the backlash cycle has already begun. People are starting to get irritated by the endless stream of reply comments consisting solely of Trash Doves, and some are even proposing a ban [from Facebook]."&lt;ref name=Kircher2017/&gt;

'''Will Brooker''' is a writer and academic, professor of film and cultural studies at Kingston University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingston.ac.uk/ Kingston University Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and an author of several books of [[cultural studies]] dealing with elements of modern pop culture and fandom, specifically [[Batman]], [[Star Wars]] and [[Alice in Wonderland]].&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://www.kingston.ac.uk/pressoffice/findanexpert/profile/48/Will-Brooker/ Kingston University profile of Dr Will Brooker], accessed 12 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

Brooker completed his BA (Hons) in film and English studies at the [[University of East Anglia]] in Norwich in 1991, and completed his PhD in cultural studies at [[Cardiff University]] in 1999. The title of his thesis was "One Life, Many Faces: The Uses and Meanings of the Batman, 1939–1999".&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Brooker also completed a postgraduate diploma in communication at Goldsmiths, where he is now recognised as one of a select group of notable alumni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/gold-stories/# ''Our Gold Stories: the people who make Goldsmiths what it is today'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooker has worked at [[Kingston University]] since 2005. From 2005 until 2007 he was senior lecturer and field leader for film studies, and from 2007 until 2009 he served as principal lecturer and director of studies for film and television. He was promoted to reader in 2009 and professor in 2013. He is currently the director of research of Kingston's Film and Television Department.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; On 1 January 2013, Brooker became the first British editor of ''Cinema Journal'' since the publication was established in 1967. His five-year term ran until 31 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmstudies.org/news/77078/ Society for Cinema and Media Studies – New CJ Editor Announced], accessed 15 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Brooker's first major [[monograph]], ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'',&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Will (2001) ''Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon'', Continuum [https://books.google.com/books/about/Batman_Unmasked.htmlwhid=GNRreYO91ogC&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2001. The book is a series of essays on the comic book superhero Batman, an expansion of Brooker's PhD thesis. The essays are each centred on a different period of Batman's history, drawing out the key elements that differ from period to period, as well as those that remain constant. Entertainment Weekly describes ''Batman Unmasked'' as "cutting through the mumbo jumbo...to deliver incisive analysis and very sharp reporting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20610393_279258,00.html Entertainment Weekly, issue No. 576 January 5, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker engages with the major dialogues surrounding the topic, including the question of Batman's role as a patriotic figure, questions of his sexuality and the role of ''Batman'' as a viable queer text, to the point where [[Popmatters]] refers to it as "less an analysis of the Batman than a repudiation of a number of other texts that support DC's "official" reading of the character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/batman-unmasked Popmatters review of ''Batman Unmasked''], accessed 12 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooker went on to publish ''Using the Force: Creativity, Community and Star Wars Fans''&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Will (2002), ''Using the Force: Creativity, Community and Star Wars Fans'', Continuum [https://books.google.com/books/about/Using_the_Force.html?id=80kB6JG1PVsC&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002, ''Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll in Popular Culture''&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Will (2005), ''Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll in Popular Culture'', Continuum [https://books.google.com/books/about/Alice_s_Adventures.html?id=ub11oqKaT5oC&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and ''The Blade Runner Experience: The Legacy of a Science Fiction Classic'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Will (2006) ''The Blade Runner Experience: The Legacy of a Science Fiction Classic'', Wallflower Press [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Blade_Runner_Experience.html?id=KE0XEBs2keQC&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has written the BFI Film Classics edition ''Star Wars'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Star_Wars.html?id=p-RrVblSrvMC&amp;redir_esc=y Brooker, Will (2009) ''Star Wars'', Palgrave Macmillan]&lt;/ref&gt; which received positive reviews in ''Empire'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?BID=10137 Empire's Star Wars BFI Film Classic (2009) Book Review], accessed 15 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/26/star-wars-will-brooker The Guardian – Star Wars by Will Brooker], accessed 15 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Between August 2011 and March 2012, Brooker was a regular film, television and culture commentator for the ''Times Higher Education magazine.'' His reviews and articles during this period included ''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418540 Times Higher Education Supplement – Girl with the Dragon Tattoo review], accessed 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''We Need To Talk About Kevin'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=417807&amp;sectioncode=26 Times Higher Education Supplement – We Need To Talk About Kevin review], accessed 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''One Day'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=417189&amp;c=1 Times Higher Education Supplement – One Day review], accessed 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''J.Edgar'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418770 Times Higher Education Supplement – J.

He also packs a loaded Bat-belt of theories and themes, roving from 'queer' slants to 'paratexts' to pizza tie-ins and beyond... Brooker's enthused rigour is infectious.'

In early 2013 Brooker teamed up with Suze Shore and Dr. Sarah Zaidan to create an online comic book series entitled  ''My So Called Secret Identity''. The comic has been critically acclaimed and celebrated by ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/comic-book-superheroine-cat-gender The Guardian – Comic-book superheroine Cat aims to see off gender stereotypes], accessed 30 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''Times Higher Education'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/campus-round-up-28-february-2013/2001975.article Times Higher Education – Campus round-up – 28 February 2013], accessed 30 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ms Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/02/25/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-no-its-a-feminist-superhero/ Ms Magazine – It’s A Bird!

''My So Called Secret Identity's'' success has led to both Brooker and Zaidan being invited to contribute to the British Library's ''Comics Unmasked'' exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/comics-unmasked/index.html?ns_campaign=comics&amp;ns_mchannel=bl_website&amp;ns_source=carousel&amp;ns_linkname=comics_image_link&amp;ns_fee=0 ''Comics Unmasked'']&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker and Zaidan will join comics' greats [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Grant Morrison]] as panellists in the ''(Super)Hero with 1000 Faces'' panel on 16 June 2014 to discuss the importance of superheroes to the comics medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/whatson/events/event160662.html ''(Super)Hero with 1000 Faces'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''My So Called Secret Identity'' has also been noticed by the London fashion magazine ''Stylist,'' who ran a feature--"Comic Books: Not Just for the Boys"—that highlighted ''My So Called Secret Identity'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://ciajackson.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/stylist-magazine-comic-books-not-just-for-the-boys/ ''Stylist Magazine: Comic Books: Not Just for the Boys'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, following "Magic Words: An Evening With Alan Moore", Brooker criticised Moore’s short film ''An Act of Faith'' on [[Twitter]] for its representation of sexualised violence. He also raised concerns about Kevin O’Neill’s suggestion that the "Golliwog" from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier, is “an incredibly powerful black character”, and Moore’s description of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a “bipolar Cyclops”. Moore responded to Brooker and other critics in a [ lengthy interview in which Moore referred to Brooker as "Batman scholar."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://slovobooks.wordpress.com/2014/01/09/last-alan-moore-interview/ Last Alan Moore Interview]," Slovo Books&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker responded online on [[Sequart Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequart.org/magazine/39259/twisted-times-my-part-in-alan-moores-last-interview/ Twisted Times: My Part in Alan Moore's 'Last Interview'], accessed 16 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Sim]] reflected upon the controversy, suggesting that although he feels that it is difficult to find fault with Alan Moore's "bottom line", he "can't see why Dr. Brooker shouldn't vent about" the content of Moore's work.&lt;ref&gt;A Moment of Cerebus [http://www.momentofcerebus.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/comic-art-metaphysics-ii-double-helix.html?m=1], accessed 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zombies}}

A '''zombie''' ([[Haitian French]]: ''{{lang|fr|zombi}}'', {{lang-ht|zonbi}}) is a fictional [[undead]] being created through the reanimation of a human [[corpse]]. Zombies are most commonly found in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] genre works. The term comes from [[Culture of Haiti#Folklore and mythology|Haitian folklore]], where a ''zombie'' is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Modern depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke [[science fiction]]al methods such as [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s, [[radiation]], mental diseases, [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, [[pathogens]], scientific accidents, etc.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|author=Maçek III, J.C.|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human|editor= Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&amp;pg=PA57|isbn=978-0-8232-3447-9 |publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] word "zombie" is first recorded in 1819, in a history of [[Brazil]] by the poet [[Robert Southey]], in the form of "zombi".&lt;ref name="Zombie"&gt;[http://0-www.oed.com.catalogue.ulrls.lon.ac.uk/view/Entry/232982?redirectedFrom=zombie#eid "Zombie"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online {{subscription}}, accessed 23 May 2014. The quotation cited is: "Zombi, the title whereby he [chief of Brazilian natives] was called, is the name for the Deity, in the Angolan tongue."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives the origin of the word as West African, and compares it to the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] words ''{{lang|kg|nzambi}}'' (god) and ''{{lang|kg|zumbi}}'' ([[fetishism|fetish]]).  A [[Kimbundu]]-to -Portuguese dictionary from 1903 defines the related word &lt;i&gt;nzumbi&lt;/i&gt; as soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pereira Do Nascimento|first= Jose|date= 1903|title= Diccionario Portuguez-Kimbundu|url= https://archive.org/details/diccionarioport00nascgoog|publisher= Huilla : Typographia da Missão|}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a later Kimbundu{{endash}}Portuguese dictionary defines it as being a "spirit that is supposed to wander the earth to torment the living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= de Assis Junior|first= A.|date= unknown|title= Diccionario Portuguez-Kimbundu|url= https://archive.org/stream/dicionriokimbu00assiuoft#page/378/search/nzumbi|publisher= Luanda Argente, Santos|}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

One of the first books to expose Western culture to the concept of the voodoo zombie was ''The Magic Island'' by [[William Seabrook|W. B. Seabrook]] in 1929. This is the sensationalized account of a narrator who encounters [[Voodoo doll|voodoo]] cults in [[Haiti]] and their resurrected thralls. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] claimed that the book "introduced 'zombi' into U.S. speech".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764649,00.html |title=Books: Mumble-Jumble |publisher=TIME |date=1940-09-09 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zombies have a complex literary heritage, with antecedents ranging from [[Richard Matheson]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]] to [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' drawing on European folklore of the [[undead]]. In 1932, [[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s, with notable films including ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943) and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959).

A new version of the zombie, distinct from that described in Haitian folklore, has also emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the twentieth century. This "zombie" is taken largely from [[George A. Romero]]'s seminal film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; which was in turn partly inspired by [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&amp;pg=PA57 Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie as Post-Human].

The "[[zombie apocalypse]]" concept, in which the civilized world is brought low by a global zombie infestation, became a staple of modern popular art.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word "zombie" is first recorded in 1819, in a history of [[Brazil]] by the poet [[Robert Southey]], in the form of "zombi", actually referring to the Afro-Brazilian rebel leader named [[Zumbi]] and the etymology of his name in "nzambi".&lt;ref name="Zombie"/&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] gives the origin of the word as West African and compares it to the [[Kongo language|Kongo]] words "nzambi" (god) and "zumbi" (fetish).

In [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian folklore]], a ''zombie'' ([[Haitian French]]: ''zombi'', [[Haitian Creole]]: ''zonbi'') is an [[Undead|animated corpse]] raised by magical means, such as [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Zombie | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been popularly associated with the [[Haitian Vodou|religion of voodoo]], but it plays no part in that faith's formal practices.

How the creatures in contemporary zombie films came to be called "zombies" is not fully clear. The film ''Night of the Living Dead'' made no spoken reference to its undead antagonists as "zombies", describing them instead as "[[ghoul]]s" (though ghouls, which derive from Arabic folklore, are demons, not undead). Although George Romero used the term "ghoul" in his original scripts, in later interviews he used the term "zombie". The word "zombie" is used exclusively by Romero in his 1978 script for his sequel ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'',&lt;ref&gt;George A. Romero ''Dawn of the Dead'' (Working draft 1977) [http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt Horrorlair.com]&lt;/ref&gt; including once in dialog. According to George Romero, film critics were influential in associating the term "zombie" to his creatures, and especially the French magazine "[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]". He eventually accepted this linkage, even though he remained convinced at the time that "zombies" corresponded to the undead slaves of Haitian voodoo as depicted in [[Bela Lugosi]]'s ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J'irai loler sur vos tombes - Romero|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CFFRkLqrg|location=11min 15sec|date=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk beliefs==

===Haitian tradition===
[[File:Zombie haiti ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|right|A depiction of a zombie, at twilight, in a field of sugar cane.]]
Zombies are featured widely in Haitian rural folklore as dead persons physically revived by the act of [[necromancy]] of a ''[[bokor]]'', a sorcerer or witch. The ''bokor'' is opposed by the ''[[houngan]]'' or priest and the ''[[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]'' or priestess of the formal [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo religion]]. A zombie remains under the control of the ''bokor'' as a personal slave, having no will of its own.

The Haitian tradition also includes an incorporeal type of zombie, the "zombie [[Astral body|astral]]", which is a part of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. A ''bokor'' can capture a zombie astral to enhance his spiritual power. A zombie astral can also be sealed inside a specially decorated bottle by a ''bokor'' and sold to a client to bring luck, healing, or business success. It is believed that God eventually will reclaim the zombie's soul, so the zombie is a temporary spiritual entity.&lt;ref name = Bottle&gt;*McAlister, Elizabeth. 1995."[http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=div2facpubs A Sorcerer's Bottle: The Visual Art of Magic in Haiti." In Donald J. Cosentino, ed., Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou. UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 1995: 304–321.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested{{who|date=October 2015}} that the two types of zombie reflect [[soul dualism]], a [[Haitian Vodou#Soul|belief of Haitian voodoo]]. Each type of legendary zombie is therefore missing one half of its soul (the flesh or the spirit).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The zombie belief has its roots in traditions brought to Haiti by enslaved Africans, and their subsequent experiences in the New World. It was thought that the voodoo deity [[Baron Samedi]] would gather them from their grave to bring them to a heavenly afterlife in Africa ("[[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]"), unless they had offended him in some way, in which case they would be forever a slave after death, as a zombie. A zombie could also be saved by [[Salt#In religion|feeding them salt]]. English professor [[Amy Wilentz]] has written that the modern concept of Zombies was strongly influenced by [[slavery in Haiti|Haitian slavery]]. Slave drivers on the plantations, who were usually slaves themselves and sometimes Voodoo priests, used the fear of zombification to discourage slaves from committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/opinion/a-zombie-is-a-slave-forever.html |title=A Zombie Is a Slave Forever |location=Haiti |work=The New York Times |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilentz |first=Amy |url=https://amywilentz.com/from-the-newsstands/response-to-i-walked-with-a-zombie/ |title=Response to “I Walked with a Zombie” |work=amywilentz.com |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most scholars have associated the Haitian zombie with African cultures, a connection has also been suggested to the island's indigenous [[Taíno people]], partly based on an early account of native [[Shamanism|shamanist]] practices written by the Hieronymite monk [[Ramón Pané]], a companion of [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/panerelacion.html|title=The Relacion of Fray Ramon Pane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=Neal L.|title=Of Cannibals and Kings: Primal Anthropology in the Americas|date=2011|publisher=Penn State Press|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmonds|first1=Ennis B.|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Michelle A.|title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction|date=2010|publisher=NYU Press|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haitian zombie phenomenon first attracted widespread international attention during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] (1915–1934), when a number of [[medical history|case histories]] of purported "zombies" began to emerge. The first popular book covering the topics was [[William Seabrook]]'s ''The Magic Island'' (1929). Seabrooke cited Article 246 of the Haitian [[criminal code]] which was passed in 1864, asserting that it was an official recognition of zombies. This passage was later used in promotional materials for the 1932 film ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seabrook|first1=William|title=The Magic Island|date=1929|publisher=Blue Ribbon Books|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, while researching [[folklore]] in Haiti, [[Zora Neale Hurston]] encountered the case of a woman who appeared in a village. A family claimed she was Felicia Felix-Mentor, a relative who had died and been buried in 1907 at the age of 29. The woman was examined by a doctor; X-rays indicated that she did not have a leg fracture that Felix-Mentor was known to have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mars | first1 = Louis P. | title = Media life zombies for the world| doi = 10.2307/2792947 | jstor = 2792947 | journal = [[Man (journal)|Man]]| volume = 45 | number = 22| pages = 38–40 | year = 1945 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston pursued rumors that affected persons were given a powerful [[psychoactive drug]], but she was unable to locate individuals willing to offer much information.

===African and related legends===
A Central or West African origin for the Haitian zombie has been postulated based on two etymologies in the [[Kongo language]], ''nzambi'' ("god") and ''zumbi'' ("[[fetishism|fetish]]"). This root helps form the names of several deities, including the Kongo creator deity [[Nzambi a Mpungu]] and the Louisiana serpent deity [[Li Grand Zombi]] (a local version of the Haitian [[Damballa]]), but it is in fact a generic word for a divine spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreman|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Rushton|first2=Cory James|title=Race, Oppression and the Zombie: Essays on Cross-Cultural Appropriations of the Caribbean Tradi|date=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=3 | isbn= 978-0-7864-5911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common African conception of beings under these names is more similar to the incorporeal "zombie astral",&lt;ref name = Bottle/&gt; as in the Kongo [[Nkisi]] spirits.

A related, but also often incorporeal, undead being is the [[jumbee]] of the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|English-speaking Caribbean]], considered to be of the same etymology;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Brian L.|title=Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana, 1838-1900|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|pages=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[French West Indies]] also, local "zombies" are recognized, but these are of a more general spirit nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dayan|first=Joan|title=Haiti, History, and the Gods|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of physical zombie-like creatures is present in some South African cultures, where they are called ''xidachane'' in [[Sotho language|Sotho]]/[[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] and ''maduxwane'' in [[Venda language|Venda]]. In some communities, it is believed that a dead person can be zombified by a small child.&lt;ref name="Marinovich84"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the spell can be broken by a powerful enough [[sangoma]].&lt;ref name="Marinovich98"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots from a Hidden War |last1=Marinovich |first1=Greg |authorlink=Greg Marinovich |author2=Silva Joao |year=2000 |publisher=William Heinemann|isbn=0-434-00733-1 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed in some areas of South Africa that [[witch]]es can zombify a person by killing and possessing the victim's body in order to force it into slave labor.&lt;ref name=Niehaus&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niehaus |first= Isak |title=Witches and Zombies of the South African Lowveld: Discourse, Accusations and Subjective Reality |journal= The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2005|volume= 11| pages =197–198 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00232.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rail lines were built to transport migrant workers, stories emerged about "witch trains". These trains appeared ordinary, but were staffed by zombified workers controlled by a witch. The trains would abduct a person boarding at night, and the person would then either be turned into a zombified worker, or beaten and thrown from the train a distance away from the original location.&lt;ref name=Niehaus/&gt;

===Origins of zombie beliefs===
====Chemical hypothesis====
Several decades after Hurston's work,  [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], a Harvard [[ethnobotanist]], presented a pharmacological case for zombies in a 1983 paper in the ''[[Journal of Ethnopharmacology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 6668953|year = 1983|last1 = Davis|first1 = E. W.|title = The ethnobiology of the Haitian zombi|journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume = 9|issue = 1|pages = 85–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in two popular books, ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' (1985) and ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie ''(1988).

Davis traveled to Haiti in 1982 and, as a result of his investigations, claimed that a living person can be turned into a zombie by two special powders being introduced into the blood stream (usually via a wound). The first, ''coup de poudre'' (French: "powder strike"), includes [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), a powerful and frequently fatal neurotoxin found in the flesh of the [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] (order Tetraodontidae). The second powder consists of [[Deliriant|deliriant drugs]] such as [[datura]]. Together, these powders were said to induce a deathlike state in which the will of the victim would be entirely subjected to that of the bokor. Davis also popularized the story of [[Clairvius Narcisse]], who was claimed to have succumbed to this practice. The most ethically questioned and least scientifically explored ingredient of the powders, is part of a recently buried child's brain.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1985), ''The Serpent and the Rainbow'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp 92-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Wade (1988), ''Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie'', [[University of North Carolina Press]], pp 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/zombies_and_tetrodotoxin/|author=Terence Hines|title=Zombies and Tetrodotoxin; Follow-up|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer (csicop.org)|volume=32.3|date=2008|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|date=September 2013}}

The process described by Davis was an initial state of deathlike [[suspended animation]], followed by re-awakening&amp;nbsp;— typically ''after'' being buried&amp;nbsp;— into a psychotic state. The psychosis induced by the drug and [[psychological trauma]] was [[hypothesis]]ed by Davis to reinforce culturally learned beliefs and to cause the individual to reconstruct their identity as that of a zombie, since they "knew" they were dead, and had no other role to play in the Haitian society. Societal reinforcement of the belief was hypothesized by Davis to confirm for the zombie individual the zombie state, and such individuals were known to hang around in graveyards, exhibiting attitudes of low affect.

Davis's claim has been criticized, particularly the suggestion that Haitian witch doctors can keep "zombies" in a state of pharmacologically induced trance for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = W | year = 1988 | title = Voodoo Science | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 240 | issue = 4850| pages = 274–277 | doi=10.1126/science.3353722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of [[Tetrodotoxin poisoning|TTX poisoning]] range from numbness and nausea to paralysis&amp;nbsp;— particularly of the muscles of the diaphragm&amp;nbsp;— unconsciousness, and death, but do not include a stiffened gait or a deathlike trance. According to psychologist [[Terence Hines]], the scientific community dismisses tetrodotoxin as the cause of this state, and Davis' assessment of the nature of the reports of Haitian zombies is viewed as overly credulous.&lt;ref name="Hines, Terence Pages 60–62"&gt;Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; Pages 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social hypothesis====
Scottish psychiatrist [[R. D. Laing]] highlighted the link between social and cultural expectations and compulsion, in the context of [[schizophrenia]] and other mental illness, suggesting that schizogenesis may account for some of the psychological aspects of zombification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oswald|first=Hans Peter|title=Vodoo|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|date=2009|page=39|isbn=3-8370-5904-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Particularly, this suggests cases where schizophrenia manifests a state of [[catatonia]].

[[Roland Littlewood]], professor of anthropology and psychiatry, published a study supporting a social explanation of the zombie phenomenon in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Littlewood |first1=Roland |author2=Chavannes Douyon|title=Clinical findings in three cases of zombification|journal=[[The Lancet]]|date=11 October 1997|volume=350|issue=9084|pages=1094–1096|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)04449-8/fulltext|accessdate=28 March 2014 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)04449-8 |pmid=10213568}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The social explanation sees observed cases of people identified as zombies as a [[culture-bound syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wcprr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jan065759.pdf|title = Interview with Roland Littlewood on 5th December 2005|last = Dein|first = Simon|date = January 2006|journal = World Cultural Psychiatry Research Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 57–59|volume = 1|issue = 1|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206150301/http://www.wcprr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jan065759.pdf|archive-date = 6 February 2016|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Cultural variations in adoption|particular cultural form of adoption]] practiced in Haiti that unites the [[Homelessness and mental health|homeless and mentally ill]] with grieving families who see them as their "returned" lost loved ones, as Littlewood summarizes his findings in an article in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'':

{{quote|I came to the conclusion that although it is unlikely that there is a single explanation for all cases where zombies are recognised by locals in Haiti, the mistaken identification of a wandering mentally ill stranger by bereaved relatives is the most likely explanation in many cases. People with a chronic schizophrenic illness, brain damage or learning disability are not uncommon in rural Haiti, and they would be particularly likely to be identified as zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Littlewood|first=Roland|title=The plight of the living dead|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/the-plight-of-the-living-dead/104813.article|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=1 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Frankenstein Cooke 1823.jpg|thumb|right|The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|T. P. Cooke]] as Frankenstein's Monster in an 1823 stage production of the novel]]
''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], while not a zombie novel in particular, prefigures many 20th-century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one, and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves. ''Frankenstein'', published in 1818, has its roots in European folklore,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Marina. ''A forgotten gem: Das Gespensterbuch ('The Book of Ghosts'), An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; whose tales of vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of the [[vampire]]. Later notable 19th-century stories about the avenging undead included [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s "[[The Death of Halpin Frayser]]", and various [[Gothic Romanticism]] tales by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Though their works could not be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], by Lovecraft's own admission.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927, 1933–1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and early 1930s, the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft wrote several [[novella]]e that explored the undead theme. "[[Cool Air]]", "[[In the Vault]]", and "[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]" all deal with the undead, but Lovecraft's ''[[Herbert West–Reanimator]]'' (1921) "helped define zombies in popular culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&amp;content=reanimator |title=When Zombies Attack! |publisher=UGO.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620020631/http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&amp;content=reanimator |archive-date=20 June 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of short stories featured [[Herbert West]], a [[mad scientist]] who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results. Notably, the resurrected dead are uncontrollable, mostly mute, primitive and extremely violent; though they are not referred to as zombies, their portrayal was prescient, anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] similarly depicted animated corpses in the [[Lost on Venus|second book]] of his [[Amtor|Venus series]], again without ever using the terms "zombie" or "undead".

Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s [[EC Comics]], which [[George A. Romero]] would later claim as an influence. The comics, including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Vault of Horror'' and ''Weird Science'', featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly, including adaptations of Lovecraft's stories, which included "In the Vault", "Cool Air" and ''Herbert West–Reanimator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/periodicals/comics/lovecraft/comics1.htm |title=Miskatonic University library - H.P. Lovecraft in the Comics |publisher=Yankeeclassic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', although classified as a vampire story would nonetheless have definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of [[George A. Romero]]. The novel and its 1964 film adaptation, ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', which concern a lone human survivor waging war against a world of vampires, would by Romero's own admission greatly influence his 1968 low-budget film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'';&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Clasen|first=Mathias|year=2010|title=Vampire Apocalypse: A Biocultural Critique of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v034/34.2.clasen.html|work=Philosophy and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biodrowsk"&gt;Biodrowski, Steve. [http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/nightofthelivingdead.html "''Night of the Living Dead'': The classic film that launched the modern zombie genre"]&lt;/ref&gt; a work that would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it.

Voodoo-related zombie themes have also appeared in espionage or adventure themed works outside the horror genre.  For example, the original "[[Jonny Quest]]" series (1964) and the [[James Bond]] novel and movie ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' both feature Caribbean villains who falsely claim the voodoo power of zombification in order to keep others in fear of them.

The modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to [[George A. Romero]]'s 1968 film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Harper, ''Night of the Living Dead: Reappraising an Undead Classic''. Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 50, November 2005.

T. |editor-last=Joshi |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2007 |isbn=0313337802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his films, Romero "bred the zombie with the vampire, and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James B. |last=Twitchell |title=Dreadful Pleasures: An Anatomy of Modern Horror |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0195035666 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as [[Living Dead#Romero's versus O'Bannon's zombies|Romero zombies]].

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," complained Ebert. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence.

There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying."&lt;ref name="Ebertreview"&gt;Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 5, 1969, at [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-night-of-the-living-dead-1968 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed July 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Romero's reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics; he used zombies not just for their own sake, but as a vehicle "to criticize real-world social ills—such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed and exploitation—while indulging our post-apocalyptic fantasies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp |title=Zombies |publisher=GreenCine |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132607/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Night'' was the first of six films in Romero's [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|''Living Dead'' series]]. Its first sequel, ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', was released in 1978.

[[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi 2]]'' was released just months after ''Dawn of the Dead'' as an ersatz sequel (''Dawn of the Dead'' was released in several other countries as ''Zombi'' or ''Zombie'').&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

====1980s and 1990s====
The 1981 film ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]'' referenced a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion: an idea also used in [[Dan O'Bannon]]'s 1985 film ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. ''Return of the Living Dead'' featured zombies that hungered specifically for brains.

The mid-1980s produced few zombie films of note. Perhaps the most notable entry, ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' series, while highly influential are not technically zombie films but films about [[demonic possession]], despite the presence of the undead. 1985's ''[[Re-Animator]]'', loosely based on the Lovecraft story, stood out in the genre, achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reanimator/?critic=columns |title=Re-Animator |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming a modest success, nearly outstripping Romero's ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' for box office returns.

Notable entries include director [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] ultra-gory film ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released as ''Dead Alive'' in the U.S.), [[Bob Balaban|Bob Balaban's]] comic 1993 film ''[[My Boyfriend's Back (1993 film)|My Boyfriend's Back]]'' where a self-aware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh, and Michele Soavi's ''[[Dellamorte Dellamore]]'' (1994) (released as ''Cemetery Man'' in the U.S.). Several years later, zombies experienced a renaissance in low-budget Asian cinema, with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries including ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998), ''[[Wild Zero]]'' (1999), ''[[Junk (film)|Junk]]'' (1999), ''[[Versus (2000 film)|Versus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Stacy (film)|Stacy]]'' (2001).

====Zombie apocalypse====
{{main|Zombie apocalypse}}

Intimately tied to the concept of the modern zombie is the "zombie apocalypse"; the breakdown of society as a result of an initial zombie outbreak that spreads. This [[archetype]] has emerged as a prolific subgenre of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic fiction]] and has been portrayed in many zombie-related media after ''Night of the Living Dead''.&lt;ref name="Paffenroth"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kim |last=Paffenroth |title=Gospel of the Living Dead: George Romero's Visions of Hell on Earth |location=Waco |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1932792651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a zombie apocalypse, a widespread (usually global) rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization. Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves. This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading phenomenon swamps normal military and law enforcement organizations, leading to the panicked collapse of civilized society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain, scavenging for food and supplies in a world reduced to a pre-industrial hostile wilderness. Possible causes for zombie behavior in a modern population can be attributed to viruses, bacteria or other phenomena that reduce the mental capacity of humans causing them to behave in a very primitive and destructive fashion. &lt;!--"Pre-industrial" is correct. "Post-industrial" is something completely different; see [[Post-industrial society]].--&gt;

====Subtext====
The usual subtext of the zombie apocalypse is that civilization is inherently vulnerable to the unexpected, and that [[Misanthropy|most individuals if desperate enough cannot be relied on to comply with the author's ethos]]. The narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the United States in the 1960s, when ''Night of the Living Dead'' provided an indirect commentary on the dangers of conformity, a theme also explored in the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' (1954) and associated film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956).&lt;ref name="Rockoff"&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Rockoff |title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978–1986 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland |year=2002 |page=35 |isbn=0-7864-1227-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Zombie Movies |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Clute |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Grant |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1999 |page=1048 |isbn=0-312-19869-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxieties about the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/preview-max-brooks-festival-of-the-living-dead-barbican-london-422481.html |title=Preview: Max Brooks' Festival of the (Living) Dead! Barbican, London |accessdate=19 September 2008 |last=Cripps |first=Charlotte |date=1 November 2006 |work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar concluded that "more than any other monster, zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic ... they signal the end of the world as we have known it."&lt;ref name="Paffenroth"/&gt; While zombie apocalypse scenarios are secular, they follow a religious pattern based on Christian ideas of an end-times war and messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Slaves, Cannibals, and Infected Hyper-Whites: The Race and Religion of Zombies|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/anthropological_quarterly/v085/85.2.mcalister.html|journal = Anthropological Quarterly|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1534-1518|pages = 457–486|volume = 85|issue = 2|doi = 10.1353/anq.2012.0021|first = Elizabeth|last = McAlister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a large number of thematic films and video games, the idea of a zombie apocalypse has entered the mainstream, and many fans have begun making efforts to prepare for the hypothetical future zombie apocalypse. Such efforts include creating weapons and selling educational material informing people how to survive a zombie outbreak; while most of these are tongue-in-cheek and do not represent an authentic belief that a zombie apocalypse in the near future is likely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/12/10-geeky-gifts/ |title=10 Geeky Gifts for Under $10 |accessdate=13 February 2011 |first=Michael |last=Harrison |date=5 December 2008 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dealsofthedead.com/ |title=Zombie Costumes |accessdate=13 February 2016 |first=Paddy |last=Cohen |date=13 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention#CDC zombie apocalypse outreach campaign|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have used the fictional scenario]]&lt;!--Two links to the same article in the same sentence is completely uncalled for!--&gt; to demonstrate survival and emergency-preparedness techniques that may be useful in a "real-world" setting.

====Story elements====
[[File:John A. Russo as zombie in Night of the Living Dead.JPG|thumb|[[John A. Russo]] portrays a zombie in ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.]]

# Initial contacts with zombies are extremely dangerous and traumatic, causing shock, panic, disbelief and possibly denial, hampering survivors' ability to deal with hostile encounters.&lt;ref name=surviving&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27770863/ |title=Surviving a zombie apocalypse: 'Left 4 Dead' writer talks about breathing life into zombie genre |accessdate=3 December 2008 |first=Todd |last=Kenreck |date=17 November 2008 |work=Video game review |publisher=[[msnbc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The response of authorities to the threat is slower than its rate of growth, giving the zombie plague time to expand beyond containment. This results in the collapse of the given society. Zombies take full control, while small groups of the living must fight for their survival.&lt;ref name=surviving/&gt;

The stories usually follow a single group of survivors, caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis. The narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague, then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities, the failure of those authorities, through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large-scale organization and the characters' subsequent attempts to survive on their own. Such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe, and how their personalities are changed by the stress, often acting on more primal motivations (fear, self-preservation) than they would display in normal life.&lt;ref name=surviving/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=852597 |title=Max Brooks |accessdate=28 October 2008 |last=Daily |first=Patrick |work=Chicago Reader |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221073910/http://events.chicagoreader.com/events/Event?oid=852597 |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre, with the publication of ''[[Book of the Dead (anthology)|Book of the Dead]]'' (1990) and its follow-up ''Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2'' (1992), both edited by horror authors [[John Skipp]] and Craig Spector. Featuring Romero-inspired stories from the likes of [[Stephen King]], the ''Book of the Dead'' compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true "zombie literature". Horror novelist [[Stephen King]] has written about zombies including his short story "[[Home Delivery (short story)|Home Delivery]]" (1990) and his novel ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' (2006) concerning a struggling young artist on a trek from Boston to [[Maine]] in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide outbreak of zombie-like maniacs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Brooks]]'s novel ''[[World War Z]]'' (2006) became a [[New York Times bestseller]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 15 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks had previously authored  ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' (2003), a zombie-themed parody of pop-fiction survival guides published in 2003.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;Craig Wilson, "Zombies lurch into popular culture via books, plays, more," ''[[USA Today]]'', 9 April 2009, p. 1D (1st page of Life section, [[above the fold]]), found at [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-04-08-zombies-pop-culture_N.htm Zombies lurch into popular culture article at USA Today]. Retrieved 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because "Other monsters may threaten individual humans, but the living dead threaten the entire human race.... Zombies are slate wipers." [[Seth Grahame-Smith]]'s mashup novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' (2009) combines the full text of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) with a story about a zombie epidemic within the novel's [[British Regency]] period setting.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; In 2009, Katy Hershbereger of [[St. Martin's Press]] stated "In the world of traditional horror, nothing is more popular right now than zombies.... The living dead are here to stay."&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

The zombie also appears as a metaphor in protest songs, symbolizing mindless adherence to authority, particularly in law enforcement and the armed forces. Well-known examples include [[Fela Kuti]]'s 1976 album ''[[Zombie (album)|Zombie]]'', and [[The Cranberries]]' 1994 single "[[Zombie (song)|Zombie]]".

Organized [[zombie walk]]s have been staged, either as performance art or as part of protests that parody political extremism or apathy.&lt;ref name="sosd"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20070726-9999-1n26zombies.html |title = Zombies haunt San Diego streets |accessdate =1 October 2009 |author = Colley, Jenna |publisher = signonsandiego.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csl"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200604/s1627099.htm |title = They came, they saw, they lurched |accessdate = 1 October 2009 |author = Kemble, Gary |publisher = ABC |location = Australia |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091004113014/http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200604/s1627099.htm |archive-date = 4 October 2009 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblood.com/zombiewalk1.html |title=The Dead Walk |accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Dalgetty, Greg |work=Penny Blood magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906054540/http://www.pennyblood.com/zombiewalk1.html |archivedate=6 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/dining/31116719.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUt:aDyaEP:kD:aUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU |title = Nightlife: 'Dead' ahead |accessdate =1 October 2009 |author = Horgen, Tom |publisher = StarTribune.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guin"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/guinness-certifies-record-second-annual-zombie-walk |title = Guinness certifies record for second annual Zombie Walk |accessdate = 1 October 2009 |author = Dudiak, Zandy |publisher = yourpenntrafford.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090123041112/http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/guinness-certifies-record-second-annual-zombie-walk |archive-date = 23 January 2009 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the zombie walk is the zombie run.  Here participants do a [[5k run]] wearing a belt with several flag "lives".  If the chasing zombies capture all of the flags the runner becomes "infected".  If he or she reaches the finish line—which may involve wide detours—ahead of the zombies the participant is a "survivor".  In either case an appropriate participation medal is awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zombierun.com/#!zombierunaboutus/c2414|title=Zombie Run Homepage|website=Zombie Run Homepage|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In theoretical academic papers===
Researchers have used theoretical zombie infections to test epidemiology modeling. One study found that all humans end up turned or dead. This is because the main epidemiological risk of zombies, besides the difficulties of neutralizing them, is that their population just keeps increasing; generations of humans merely "surviving" still have a tendency to feed zombie populations, resulting in gross outnumbering. The researchers explain that their methods of modelling may be applicable to the spread of political views or diseases with dormant infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://loe.org/images/content/091023/Zombie%20Publication.pdf |title=When Zombies Attack!: Mathematical Modelling of an Outbreak of Zombie Infection |last=Munz |first=Philip |last2=Hudea |first2=Ioan |last3=Imad |first3=Joe |last4=Smith |first4=Robert J. |format=PDF |pages=133–150 |year=2009 |access-date=9 August 2018 |isbn=978-1-60741-347-9 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/zombies/ |title=Mathematical Model for Surviving a Zombie Attack |last=Tchuenche |first=J.M. |last2=Chiyaka |first2=C. |date=14 August 2009 |access-date=9 August 2018 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Chodorow of the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] at [[Arizona State University]] investigated the [[estate tax|estate]] and [[income tax]] implications of a zombie apocalypse under [[Internal Revenue Code|United States federal]] and state tax codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2045255 |title=Death and Taxes and Zombies |last=Chodorow |first=Adam |journal=[[Iowa Law Review]] |date=7 May 2012 |volume=98 |page=1207 |url=https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2012/07/SSRN-id2045255.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists Bradley Voytek and Timothy Verstynen have built a side career in extrapolating how ideas in neuroscience would theoretically apply to zombie brains. Their work has been featured in ''Forbes'', ''New York Magazine'', and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Zombies-on-the-Brain/133043/ |title=Young Neuroscientists' Popular Zombie Study Frightens Their Advisers Most of All |newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |last=Mole |first=Beth |date=23 July 2012 |access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
