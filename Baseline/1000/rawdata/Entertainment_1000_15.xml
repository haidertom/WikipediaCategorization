      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">'''Air sex''' is a performance activity invented in [[Japan]]; clothed men and women simulate [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with an invisible partner, often in an exaggerated manner, set to music, and in a competition before an audience. This is somewhat akin to playing [[air guitar]], explaining the name. The creator, ''J-Taro Sugisaku'', says that it was invented in [[Tokyo]] in 2006 by a group of bored men without girlfriends. 

A report about the phenomenon in the Japanese magazine ''Weekly Playboy'' in 2006 was picked up by the English language web site ''[[Mainichi Shimbun|Mainichi Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/09/20060921p2g00m0dm003000c.html Japan's air sex world champion licks himself into shape]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mainichi Daily News, 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the air sex "world championship" was uploaded to [[YouTube]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22Air+Sex+World+Championship%22 Air Sex World Championship], YouTube, uploaded 2 January 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a segment of the [[BBC Three]] documentary show ''[[Japanorama]]'' in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;
''Japanorama'', Series 3, Episode 2, BBC3, first aired 26 March 2007
&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently uploaded to YouTube and flagged as "inappropriate for some users".

These videos led to coverage in the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Air_Sex Air Sex links], by Buzzfeed
&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Japanorama'' video was shown in May 2007 at the [[JACON|JACON 2007]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], and a spontaneous air sex competition ensued, footage of which also found its way to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp2FlHwu6EM Air Sex Contest Jacon '07]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January and early February 2007, a group of American black male teenagers calling themselves "Peer Pressure" produced two videos showing air sex set to music, published on YouTube under the user name "amp6". [[Fleshbot]] called these "The Best Air Sex Video of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;"Peer Pressure" performed their routine in Atlanta as part of the official Air Sex World Championships tour in June 2009.

Since August 2007, The [[Alamo Drafthouse]] has been holding bimonthly Air Sex competitions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fLBraKZ8v0 Air Sex news report on Vimby]
&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009 The Alamo Drafthouse toured the country on the Air Sex World Championships tour crowning Air Sex Champions in 14 cities. Later that October the first ever world champion was crowned when Shanghai Slammer from Los Angeles out-performed every other city champion. The tour was hosted by comedian [[Chris Trew]]. In October 2010 the group will tour once more.  Photos are posted on the Alamo Drafthouse Flickr page.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

'''Augustine's laws''' were a series of [[tongue in cheek]] [[aphorisms]] put forth by [[Norman Ralph Augustine]], an American [[aerospace]] businessman who served as [[Under Secretary of the Army]] from 1975 to 1977. In 1984 he published his laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Augustine Laws |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WgwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1109,6555752&amp;dq=augustine's+laws&amp;hl=en |quote= |work=[[United Press International]] |date=May 24, 1986 |accessdate=2010-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book and several of the laws were the topic of an article in Sound and Vibration magazine in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author= David O.

==List==

Law Number I: The best way to make a silk purse from a sow's ear is to begin with a silk sow. The same is true of money.

Law Number II: If today were half as good as tomorrow is supposed to be, it would probably be twice as good as yesterday was.

Law Number III: There are no lazy veteran lion hunters.

Law Number IV: If you can afford to advertise, you don't need to.

Law Number V: One-tenth of the participants produce over one-third of the output. Increasing the number of participants merely reduces the average output.

Law Number VI: A hungry dog hunts best. A hungrier dog hunts even better.

Law Number VII: Decreased business base increases overhead. So does increased business base.

Law Number VIII: The most unsuccessful four years in the education of a cost-estimator is fifth grade arithmetic.

Law Number IX: Acronyms and abbreviations should be used to the maximum extent possible to make trivial ideas profound...Q.E.D.

Law Number X: Bulls do not win bullfights; people do. People do not win people fights; lawyers do.

Law Number XI: If the Earth could be made to rotate twice as fast, managers would get twice as much done. If the Earth could be made to rotate twenty times as fast, everyone else would get twice as much done since all the managers would fly off.

Law Number XII: It costs a lot to build bad products.

Law Number XIII: There are many highly successful businesses in the United States. There are also many highly paid executives. The policy is not to intermingle the two.

Law Number XIV: After the year 2015, there will be no airplane crashes. There will be no takeoffs either, because electronics will occupy 100 percent of every airplane's weight.

Law Number XV: The last 10 percent of performance generates one-third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems.

Law Number XVI: In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3-1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day.

Law Number XVII: Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.

Law Number XVIII: It is very expensive to achieve high unreliability. It is not uncommon to increase the cost of an item by a factor of ten for each factor of ten degradation accomplished.

Law Number XIX: Although most products will soon be too costly to purchase, there will be a thriving market in the sale of books on how to fix them.

Law Number XX: In any given year, Congress will appropriate the amount of funding approved the prior year plus three-fourths of whatever change the administration requests, minus 4-percent tax.

Law Number XXI: It's easy to get a loan unless you need it.

Law Number XXII: If stock market experts were so expert, they would be buying stock, not selling advice.

Law Number XXIII: Any task can be completed in only one-third more time than is currently estimated.

Law Number XXIV: The only thing more costly than stretching the schedule of an established project is accelerating it, which is itself the most costly action known to man.

Law Number XXV: A revised schedule is to business what a new season is to an athlete or a new canvas to an artist.

Law Number XXVI: If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on each other, it can be assured that disaster is not left to chance.

Law Number XXVII: Rank does not intimidate hardware. Neither does the lack of rank.

Law Number XXVIII: It is better to be the reorganizer than the reorganizee.

Law Number XXIX: Executives who do not produce successful results hold on to their jobs only about five years. Those who produce effective results hang on about half a decade.

Law Number XXX: By the time the people asking the questions are ready for the answers, the people doing the work have lost track of the questions.

Law Number XXXI: The optimum committee has no members.

Law Number XXXII: Hiring consultants to conduct studies can be an excellent means of turning problems into gold, your problems into their gold.

Law Number XXXIII: Fools rush in where incumbents fear to tread.

Law Number XXXIV: The process of competitively selecting contractors to perform work is based on a system of rewards and penalties, all distributed randomly.

Law Number XXXV: The weaker the data available upon which to base one's conclusion, the greater the precision which should be quoted in order to give the data authenticity.

Law Number XXXVI: The thickness of the proposal required to win a multimillion dollar contract is about one millimeter per million dollars. If all the proposals conforming to this standard were piled on top of each other at the bottom of the Grand Canyon it would probably be a good idea.

Law Number XXXVII: Ninety percent of the time things will turn out worse than you expect. The other 10 percent of the time you had no right to expect so much.

Law Number XXXVIII: The early bird gets the worm. The early worm...gets eaten.

Law Number XXXIX: Never promise to complete any project within six months of the end of the year, in either direction.

Law Number XL: Most projects start out slowly, and then sort of taper off.

Law Number XLI: The more one produces, the less one gets.

Law Number XLII: Simple systems are not feasible because they require infinite testing.

Law Number XLIII: Hardware works best when it matters the least.

Law Number XLIV: Aircraft flight in the 21st century will always be in a westerly direction, preferably supersonic, crossing time zones to provide the additional hours needed to fix the broken electronics.

Law Number XLV: One should expect that the expected can be prevented, but the unexpected should have been expected.

Law Number XLVI: A billion saved is a billion earned.

Law Number XLVII: Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered with water. The other third is covered with auditors from headquarters.

Law Number XLVIII: The more time you spend talking about what you have been doing, the less time you have to spend doing what you have been talking about. Eventually, you spend more and more time talking about less and less until finally you spend all your time talking about nothing.

Law Number XLIX: Regulations grow at the same rate as weeds.

Law Number L: The average regulation has a life span one-fifth as long as a chimpanzee's and one-tenth as long as a human's, but four times as long as the official's who created it.

Law Number LI: By the time of the United States Tricentennial, there will be more government workers than there are workers.

Law Number LII: People working in the private sector should try to save money. There remains the possibility that it may someday be valuable again.

'''Beer pong''', also known as '''Beirut''', is a [[drinking game]] in which players throw a [[ping pong]] ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in a cup of [[beer]] on the other end. The game typically consists of opposing teams of two or more players per side with 6 or 10 cups set up in a triangle formation on each side.&lt;ref name="Shott"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shott |first=Chris |title=The Pong Arm of the Law |work=The Washington City Paper |date=October 7, 2005 |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215656/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/tell/2005/tell1007.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team then takes turns attempting to shoot ping pong balls into the opponent's cups. If a ball lands in a cup (known as a 'make'), the contents of that cup are consumed by the other team and the cup is removed from the table. The first team to eliminate all of the opponent's cups is the winner.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last=Banjo|first=Shelly|title=Thwock, Gulp, Kaching!

==Origin and name==
[[File:Throw Pong at Bucknell University.png|thumb|Members of [[Delta Upsilon]] playing Throw Pong at [[Bucknell University]] during the House Party weekend of 1980&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"/&gt;]]
The game was originally believed to have evolved from the original [[Beer pong (paddles)|beer pong played with paddles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D12FB3455127B93C1AB178FD85F468785F9 | work=The New York Times | title=About Beer-Pong | date=1972-04-23 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | first=Ted | last=Lippman }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is generally regarded to have had its origins within the fraternities of [[Dartmouth College]] in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, where it has since become part of the social culture of the campus. The original version resembled an actual [[ping pong]] game with a net and one or more cups of beer on each side of the table. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a version without paddles was invented and the names ''Beer Pong'' and ''Beirut'' were adopted in some areas of the United States sometime in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |title=l1 |publisher=Wesleyan.edu |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919095836/http://www.wesleyan.edu/argus/archives/feb212003/dateyear/w5.html |archivedate=2006-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |title=" + artTitle.replace("-","") + " - " + "The Heights" + " - " + "Features" + " |publisher=Bcheights.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817094217/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/bc-reveres-8220-ancient-8221-tradition-of-beirut-1.925582 |archivedate=2010-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bucknell University]]'s student-run newspaper, ''The Bucknellian'', claims [[Delta Upsilon]] fraternity members at Bucknell created "Throw Pong", a game very similar to beer pong, during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bucknell celebrates its part in the invention of Beer Pong|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B2ydPXnP9gA0NTRhMTVkMTctMjhlMS00YzZlLTgyYmEtMjU4Yzk1YjcxNjlk&amp;hl=en_US|accessdate=12 September 2011|newspaper=The Bucknellian|date=9 September 2011|author=Michelle Joline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bucknellian.net/10510/arts-campus-life/beer-pong-article/&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Throw Pong" was then brought to [[Lehigh University]] by fraternity brothers who visited Bucknell and this led to the creation of the version of beer pong that is played today.&lt;ref name="The Bucknellian" /&gt;

In some places, ''Beer Pong'' refers to the version of the game with paddles, and ''Beirut'' to the version without. However, according to a [[CollegeHumor]] survey, ''beer pong'' is the more common term than ''Beirut'' for the paddle-less game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |title=Beer Pong vs. Beirut: What is the game called? |work=[[CollegeHumor]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070718001013/http://www.collegehumor.com/pongmap |archivedate = 2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name "Beirut" is disputed. A 2004 op-ed article in the ''[[Daily Princetonian]],'' the student newspaper at [[Princeton University]], suggested that the name was possibly coined at Bucknell or Lehigh University around the time of the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. [[Beirut]], the capital of [[Lebanon]], was the scene of much fighting during the war, particularly [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire.&lt;ref name="DailyPrincetonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2004/11/on-language-princeton-style-the-history-of-beirut|title=On language, Princeton style: The history of 'Beirut'|last=Berner|first=Laura|date=|year=2004|work=Daily Princetonian|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setup==
[[File:Beerpong.png|thumb|A standard set up for a game of Beer Pong.]]

===Teams===
Beer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each. Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt;

===Playing field===
Although the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors. In general, this will be a [[plywood]] board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advice on building Beirut Tables |work=Terrapin Tables |url=http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022037/http://www.terrapintables.com/tables.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430061301/http://www.da.wvu.edu/show_article.php?&amp;story_id=34385 "Table of dreams"], April 18, 2008, ''The Daily Athenaeum''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html "The ultimate beer pong table"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201010251/http://www.maxim.com/sports/nfl/46277/ultimate-beer-pong-table.html |date=2010-02-01 }}, ''Maxim'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies sell tables, including portable and inflatable tables.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSHxBUrzJqQ "America's Nightly Scoreboard"], [[Fox Business Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game can be played on any flat surface.

===Equipment===
The most common cups used are {{convert|18|USfloz|ml|adj=on }} [[disposable]] [[plastic cup]]s (such as red [[Solo Cup|Solo cups]]) with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table, teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Games typically use ten cups.&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.
[[File:Red_Plastic_Cups.jpg|thumb|191x191px|Red plastic cups are sometimes associated with drinking games]]

===Alcohol===
An inexpensive [[pale lager]] or [[light beer]] of 3.2–5% [[alcohol by volume|ABV]] is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities consumed during the course of several games.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Westen |first=Brandon |title=College Connoiseur Talks About Beer |work=The Collegian |location=[[South Dakota State University]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202201232/http://www.sdsucollegian.com/2007/12/13/college-connoisseur-talks-about-beer-2/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes under house rules, there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, as is done at [[Utah State University]], where alcohol is not allowed on campus; [[root beer]] is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story.aspx?content_id=d7521600-7f40-4602-91b2-c1bcac65c86f|title=Students At Utah State Play 'Drinking Game' With Root Beer Instead|publisher=''KUTV-TV''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113215146/http://www.kutv.com/content/news/topnews/story/Students-At-Utah-State-Play-Drinking-Game-With/ABZS10B_AkaRssG8rGXIbw.cspx|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.

==Game play==
[[File:beerpong reracks.png|thumb|upright|Possible beer pong re-racks]]

Traditionally, the game of beer pong has been played by countless variations of rule sets. In recent years, organizations such as The World Series of Beer Pong have put forth "official" rules. Typically, players abide by a uniform set of "house rules" which are often consistent within one university or region of the country (e.g. "West Coast rules") or may vary on a "house-by-house" basis.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080730002708/http://www.beerpong.com/beerpong_rules.htm Beer pong rules], Beerpong.com&lt;/ref&gt; Number of cups, bouncing, re-racking, amount of alcohol, distance shots must be taken from, etc. may all vary. All house rules should be posted or verbally stated and understood by both teams before the game starts.

The order of play varies - both players on one team can shoot, followed by both players on the other team, or players on opposite teams can alternate back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525113235/http://www.bpong.com/beer-pong-rules#throwing_patterns|archivedate=2008-05-25 |title=Beer Pong Rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cup that is made must immediately have its contents drunk and be removed from play. Some rule sets allow for "''re-racking''" (also known as "''reforming''", "''rearranging''", "''consolidation''", and other names), which is a rearrangement of a team's remaining cups after some have been removed. The formations, number of cups, when to rearrange and so on, depend on the rule set. For example, a team with three remaining cups may ask the other team to "re-rack" the cups into a single triangle formation.&lt;ref name="nbpl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbpl.net/rulesno.html |title=Rules without paddles |publisher= National Beer Pong League |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common house rules allow players to 'finger' or blow the ball out of the cup if the ball spins around the inner rim. Another common house rule states that if a team makes both shots during their turn, a 'rollback' occurs allowing each player to shoot again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong#VD |title=World Series of Beer Pong rules |publisher=Bpong.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101223141420/http://www.bpong.com/wsobp/official-rules-of-the-world-series-of-beer-pong| archivedate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the World Series of Beer Pong rules, only a single-ball 'rollback' occurs resulting in a three cup maximum that can be made per turn.

Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups of water in order to wash off the balls. However, research has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria"&gt;Clay Travis, [https://archive.is/20130119014923/http://www.cbssports.com/spin/story/9981066 "The essence of beer pong bacteria"] ''CBS Sportsline''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria"&gt;Nour Hammour, [http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com "Beer pong bacteria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042131/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2006/12/11/Life/Beer-Pong.Bacteria-2531832.shtml?norewrite200612261402&amp;sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''[[GW Hatchet|The GW Hatchet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, players may put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from.

===Shot techniques===
[[File:beerpong shots.png|300px|thumb|The typical path for the different kinds of shots]]

There are three common ways to shoot in beer pong: the arc, the fastball (or "laser, snipe, kamikaze"), and the bounce shot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The most common throwing technique is the arc shot, where one grasps the ping pong ball with the tips of the thumb and forefinger, holds the arm at an angle with the ball upwards, then throws using a gentle elbow motion holding the upper arm parallel with the table.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

Some players throw "fastball" style which uses more of a hard chopping motion to send the ball in a more direct line toward the intended target cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt; A fastball shot may be favorable if house rules dictate that a cup knocked over is removed from the table, in which case a fastball can eliminate multiple cups if thrown hard enough.

A bounce shot is performed by bouncing the ball towards the cups. Depending on house rules, if the other team has the opportunity to swat away a bounced ball, a bounce shot may be worth more than one cup.&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

===Winning the game===
If a team makes their last cup, the other team loses unless they can make all of their remaining cups; this is called a rebuttal or redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, Matt [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023217/http://media.www.uwmleader.com/media/storage/paper980/news/2006/01/25/Sports/Road-To.Glory-1987477.shtml "Road to Glory"], '''UWM Leader''', Jan. 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.

Another 'house rule' can be stated before or during the game in the midst of a [[shutout]]. A shutout in beer pong occurs if one team makes all ten of their cups and the opposite team makes none of their cups. If the shutout does occur, the losing team must do whatever the two teams decided on, such as going [[streaking]] (naked lap) or drinking a large quantity of beer.

Also depending on 'house rules', there are other ways to end the game. Cups that were accidentally left in the rack after being made are known as death/kill cups. These cups will immediately end the game if made again.

==Health effects==
The game may have several associated health risks. As with any activity involving alcohol, beer pong may cause players to become [[Alcohol intoxication|drunken]] or even intoxicated enough to suffer [[alcohol poisoning]]. Also, the supposed cleaning effects of the water "dunk" cup may be offset by bacteria in the cups.&lt;ref name="The essence of beer pong bacteria" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer pong bacteria" /&gt;

Some writers have mentioned beer pong as contributing to "out of control" college drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granwehr |first=Meredith Austin |title=College Drinking: Out of Control |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |date=December 1, 2007 |url=http://articles.courant.com/2004-10-10/news/0410100754_1_party-school-emergency-room-bigger-hospital |accessdate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Bob (January 8, 2008).

Some municipalities and states have attempted to ban beer pong, either from bars or in general, due to the belief that it encourages [[binge drinking]] (see Health Effects above). In [[Oxford, Ohio]], where [[Miami University]] is located, the city council tried to ban the game from being played outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strader |first=Sean |title=Council vote freezes beer pong ban |work=The Oxford Press |url=http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218070505/http://www.oxfordpress.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/02/22/op022307drinking.html |archivedate=2009-02-18 |date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arlington, Virginia]]&lt;ref name="Shott" /&gt; and [[Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602123140/http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/05/30/several_campus_bars_punished_for "Several campus bars punished for infractions"], ''The News-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt; bar owners were told to stop allowing the game to be played in their establishments. In the fall of 2007, [[Georgetown University]] officially banned all beer pong paraphernalia such as custom-built tables and the possession of many ping-pong balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoya.com/news/082407/news2.cfm |title=News &amp;#124; The Hoya |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206003506/http://www.thehoya.com/news/082407/news2.cfm |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] ran an article on July 31, 2008 called "The War Against Beer Pong", noting legal restrictions and bans on the game in college and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong"&gt;Haire, Meaghan. [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1828085,00.html "The War Against Beer Pong"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, players have taken to placing water in cups in order to hold organized beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples of this can be found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Tournaments and leagues==
Beer pong tournaments are held in the United States at the local, regional, and national levels.

The [[World Series of Beer Pong]] (WSOBP) is the largest beer pong tournament in the world. WSOBP IV, held in January 2009 at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], had a $50,000 grand prize and over 800 participants from the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hennessey |first= Kathleen |title=Vegas beer pong competition gets (almost) serious | work = USATODAY.COM | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2009-01-05-beerpong_N.htm | date=January 5, 2009 | accessdate=2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WSOBP V, held in January 2010, had over 1,000 participants including teams from Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Japan. The World Beer Pong Tour has stops in various cities and cash prizes as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/shore/blogs/updates/index.ssf/2009/06/beer_pong_for_money_not_just_g.html "Beer pong for money, not just getting drunk"], June 10, 2009, ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more common organization of beer pong games are leagues which operate on a local or regional level. Ordinarily, a group of pong enthusiasts will create teams (partnerships) and play weekly against each other. Sometimes, the leagues have websites, rankings and statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaelson |first=Elex |title=Big Industry Flows From Beer Pong |work=San Diego Channel 6 News |date=November 11, 2008 |url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=387f95e1-101c-4e99-8d56-932dc1fe55b1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218180800/http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=387f95e1-101c-4e99-8d56-932dc1fe55b1 |archivedate=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have been started by college students with the goal of intramural competition such as at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] with the "[[Isla Vista]] Beer Pong League",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ashley Nikole |title=Students Create I.V.

==Media==
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and other media outlets have reported on the increase in businesses selling beer pong paraphernalia, such as tables, mats, cups, or clothes.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Haire, Meaghan.

This documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay, premiered at the [[CineVegas]] film festival on June 13, 2008. [[Rick Reilly]] wrote an entire column about The World Series of Beer Pong IV for ''ESPN The Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916 |title=Beer Pong: The next great american pastime |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-09 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202230908/http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3831916| archivedate= 2 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] cited the game and other drinking games as a factor in deaths of college students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080711133153/http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/07/07/drinking.game.deaths.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview " Drinking games pose serious threat"], ''Associated Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine recently had an article on the popularity of beer pong&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and posted a video on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/video/?bcpid=1214055407&amp;bctid=1717896427 VIDEO], ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt; In both, players claimed beer pong was a sport, rather than a game—similar to [[billiards]] and [[darts]].

The game has been a recurring segment on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', with host Fallon playing against female celebrity guests such as [[Betty White]], [[Serena Williams]], [[Anna Kournikova]], [[Charlize Theron]] and [[Jessica Alba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129051458/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/06/12/betty-white-takes-on-jimmy-fallons-beer-pong-challenge/ "Betty White Takes on Fallon's Beer Pong Challenge"], MTV News&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Colbert Report]]'' featured a segment on the CDC study hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/220488/march-03-2009/beer-pong-herpes-outbreak |title=Herpes through Beer Pong |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/fox_friends_spreads_herpesbeer.php "Fox &amp; Friends Spreads Herpes-Beer Pong Hoax"], ''Columbia Journalism Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Road Trip: Beer Pong]]'', a sequel to the 2000 comedy ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', featured the game prominently. [[Agnes Scott College]], where most of the movie was filmed, did not want to be listed in the credits after complaints from students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105167198 "Lowbrow Comedy Meets Higher Education"], ''National Public Radio''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing===
On August 29, 2009, [[Chronicle Books]] published ''The Book of Beer Pong'', a 200-page fully illustrated guide to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Beer Pong |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |isbn=978-0-8118-6632-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bud pong===
Bud pong was the branded version of beer pong that brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] said involved the drinking of water, not [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] or any other beer. In the summer of 2005, the company began marketing "bud pong" kits to its distributors. Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as saying that bud pong was not intended for underage drinkers because promotions were held in bars, not on campuses. And it did not promote binge drinking, she said, because official rules call for water to be used, not beer.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Gettleman |first=Jeffrey |title=As Young Adults Drink to Win, Marketers Join In |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064233/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html |archivedate=February 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' quoted a bartender at a club near [[Clemson University]] as saying she had worked at several bud pong events and had "never seen anyone playing with water. It's always beer. It's just like any other beer pong."&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Some expressed incredulity at Anheuser-Busch's public statements. Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Study at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], said: "Why would alcohol companies promote games that involve drinking water? It's preposterous,"&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; while advertising news site Adjab opined that "someone playing bud pong with water is about as likely as a teenage kid using the [[rolling paper]] he bought at the convenience store to smoke tobacco."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Adam |title=Beer Pong promotions not so good |work=Ad-Jab |date=October 18, 2005 |url=http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |accessdate=2007-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814001648/http://www.adjab.com/2005/10/18/beer-pong-promotions-not-so-good/ |archivedate=14 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of playing with water has become increasingly common on college campuses, due to the cost saving effects. Instead of drinking the beer from a glass each time a player sinks a shot, the player simply takes a shot of liquor or a sip from their own drink each time the opposing team scores. This is usually done when there isn't enough beer to accommodate a large number of games during the party.

===Video games===
[[File:Beer_Pong_Machine.jpg|thumb|219x219px|A beer pong arcade machine.]]
In July 2008, [[JV Games]] Inc. released a downloadable video game for the [[Wii]] console called ''Frat Party Games: Beer Pong''. After much outrage by parent and university groups, the game was renamed ''[[Frat Party Games: Pong Toss]]'' and all references to alcohol were removed.&lt;ref name="WarAgainstBeerPong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,377421,00.html |title='Beer Pong' Video Game Has Controversy Brewing |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Care Bears''' are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist [[Elena Kucharik]] to be used on [[greeting cards]] from [[American Greetings]], but  later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. 

The original development was through American Greetings' "Those Characters From Cleveland" [[research and development]] division, In 1983, [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] turned the Care Bears into plush [[teddy bear]]s. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'' (1984). They then had a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).

Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality.  The movie ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' named them "belly badges". Adding to the Care Bear family are the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] movies: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005) and ''The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom'' (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]''. The premiere of the series utilizes "30 years of caring". It premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, "Care Bears and Cousins", was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures &amp; blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. [[Jack Chojnacki]], the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: "It had a high aaaaaah factor."&lt;ref name=aaah&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rfEPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3720,590789&amp;dq=care+bears+movie&amp;hl=en |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |title=High 'aaah" factor has meant millions |date=April 2, 1985 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muriel Fahrion]], the artist who helped create [[Strawberry Shortcake]]'s look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXBZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears&amp;dq=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears |author1=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |author2=Union française des œuvres laïques d'éducation par l'image et le son |title=La Revue du cinéma |volume=418 |chapter=Les Bisounours (The Care Bears Movie) |language=French |page=26 |year=1986 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |quote=Scn. : Peter Sauder, d'après les personnages créés pour Those Characters from Cleveland par Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Elena Kucharik, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, Clark Willey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator [[Elena Kucharik]] became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of [[General Mills]]).&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite book |last=Pecora |first=Norma Odom |title=The Business of Children's Entertainment |isbn=1-57230-774-9 |year=1998 |publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As they had done with [[Strawberry Shortcake]], once titled "Project I", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development "Project II" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.&lt;ref name=cbsite&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301073233/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |title=History &amp; Facts: More Care Bears Fun Facts |archivedate=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1982 launch ===
On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts.&lt;ref name="cb-pr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=The biggest character launch in the history of retailing ... |date=September 24, 1982 |location=New York City |work=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal.&lt;ref name="cb-pr" /&gt; Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by [[Parker Brothers]] and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as "the biggest character launch in the history of retailing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB294D2283BB84A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=DeWolf |first=Rose |title=Out to launch: Is there shelf life after Holly Hobbie?

In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as "Message Bears". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the "heart-shaped 'touché tags'" used to identify the Care Bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=udoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5386,2660829&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en |author=[[Associated Press]] (AP) |title='Care Bears' makers lose copyright suit |date=December 14, 1983 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'', came out that same year. A [[miniseries]] based on the toys was distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company]].&lt;ref name=guilford /&gt;{{rp|52}} A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', produced by [[Nelvana]] Limited and released by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]].

In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]''. Released by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.

Later that year, a TV series titled ''The Care Bears Family'' (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and Canada's [[Global Television Network|Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new season children's shows |date=September 9, 1986 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard [[List of Care Bear characters#No Heart|No Heart]] and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece [[Shreeky]] was introduced.

The Care Bears' third film, ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', debuted in 1987. A TV special, ''[[Care Bears Nutcracker Suite]]'', premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.

Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70&amp;nbsp;million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2&amp;nbsp;billion during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=agsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |title=About Us: History |accessdate=February 26, 2006 |publisher=[[American Greetings]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210053021/http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=December 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbhistory&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062052/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |title=History &amp; Facts |archivedate=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1991 relaunch ===
In early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&amp;p_theme=ddnb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F504F756A8A1153&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=Moss |first=Meredith |title=She's a living doll |date=March 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |publisher=Cox Ohio Publishing |page=5E |quote=Patriotic bears: Two Ohio companies have joined together to teach children about the environment and patriotism....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing company [[Random House]] released two tie-in books: ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' (1991) by Bobbi Katz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[WorldCat]] |publisher=[[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910173629/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503023757/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670 |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' (1992) by Peggy Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=WorldCat |publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910010416/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=Amazon.com Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605073157/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002 relaunch ===
In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by [[Jay Foreman (businessman)|Jay Foreman]], the president of [[Fort Lauderdale]]-based [[Play Along Toys]], for less than $1&amp;nbsp;million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Kimberly L. |title=Sell It, Baby! Practical How-Tos on Marketing, Branding &amp; Sales |page=3 |isbn=1-59113-394-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Booklocker.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.

In the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kmart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[KB Toys]], and [[Mervyns]].&lt;ref name=cbfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224518/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |archivedate=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new merchandise included the Bears doing [[aerobics]]; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304010508/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |title=New &amp; Now |archivedate=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 million {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Elizabeth |title=Care Bears Receive 'Gentle' Makeover |date=February 9, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=249 |number=33 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and subsidiary [[Family Home Entertainment|FHE Pictures]], in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' in 2004 and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.

New versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13&amp;nbsp;inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.

=== 2007 relaunch ===
In 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' and immediately before with a new TV series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''. The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by [[SD Entertainment]].

As part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear,&lt;ref name="cbcollectlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |title=Care Bears: New Collection |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Play Along Toys]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829092833/http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |archivedate=August 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |title=Care Bears FAQ's |format=Flash |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Play Along Toys |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223132206/http://playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their new theme song is performed by former [[Letters to Cleo]] member, [[Kay Hanley]], and the music video premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In August 2007, they appeared in the film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |last=Strowbridge |first=C.S. |title=Limited Releases Are Very Becoming |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611082352/http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. The series premiered on [[CBS]]' ''[[KEWLopolis]]'' block on September 15, 2007.

The Care Bears franchise was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (''Grizzle-ly Adventures''), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states that in the new version, "they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight".&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

However, the Caring Meter made its return in ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, ''Ups and Downs'', included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, ''Play Day''.

On July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]'') would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/466030--cookie-jar-buys-care-bears-strawberry-shortcake |author=Associated Press (AP) |title=Cookie Jar buys Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise.

In late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, "Care Power Team". This re-imagining re-used the ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'' designs, has the bears sport "enhanced belly badges", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: ''[[Care Bears: Share Bear Shines]]'', ''[[Care Bears: The Giving Festival]]'' and ''Care Bears: To the Rescue''. In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.

In July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called ''Just Play''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |title=Care Bears count down to new toy line |website=Kidscreen |date=August 12, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029203238/http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.

In October 2014, When [[Hub Network|The Hub]] changed over to [[Discovery Family]], it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.

In January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called ''Care Bears and Cousins'' after The Hub cancelled ''Welcome to Care-a-Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |title=Netflix reviving Care Bears with new series set for 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135123/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |archive-date=May 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.

=== 2018 relaunch ===
In September 2018, a new television series, titled ''Care Bears: Unlock the Magic'', was announced. The series is to premiere on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as "the team"s newest pet and companion". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=ToonBarnTweets|number=999141838022938624|title=Care Bears: Unlock the Magic Licensing Expo 2018 ad.

== Characters and universe ==
{{fanpov|section|date=August 2018}}
{{Main|List of Care Bear characters}}
The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as "the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the [[Easter Bunny]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ashkinaze |first=Carole |title=Editorial: In quest to be Mayor, Lomax's Achilles heel was his own image |date=August 11, 1989 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |page=A23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.

The ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.

For the new 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.

Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.&lt;ref name=cbsite /&gt;

Throughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]] and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim &amp; Dumb in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.

=== Magic spells ===
The Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the "Care Bear Stare" (a.k.a. "Belly Magic"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in ''Oopsy Does It!''. In the new series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.

In the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears...prepare to stare!" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears Countdown!"

During the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the "Care Bear Cousin Call". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.

Although commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode "Tell-Tale belly".

In addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.

=== Caring meter ===
Shown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on "caring missions" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring ''anywhere''), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.

Initially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' and the first season of ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. With the release of ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.

== Merchandise ==
Apart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt; During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt;

When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.&lt;ref name="cbsite" /&gt;

In his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as "highly specialized" toys. "So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality", he stated. "Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit."&lt;ref name=pantheon&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=98 |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}
Many children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include "Meet the Care Bear Cousins" (based on the first movie), "Sweet Dreams for Sally", "The Witch Down the Street", "The Trouble with Timothy", and "A Sister for Sam". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt; As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.

In ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) "were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?"&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=217 |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comics ==
Between November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Retrieved April 16, 2006. [https://www.webcitation.org/66uZzvdc2?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the [[Madballs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |author="Wes" |title=''Care Bears'' No. 13 ... in which the Care Bears meat the Madballs |year=2008 |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |publisher=Scary-Crayon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014222444/http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |archivedate=October 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.

== Music ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}
At the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. These included "Introducing the Care Bears", "The Care Bears Care For You", "Adventures in Care-a-lot", "The Care Bears' Birthday Party", and "The Care Bears' Christmas" (all from 1983), and 1986's "Friends Make Everything Better" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt;

All of the albums from 1983 (except for "Birthday Party") featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]] (who were the lead singers of [[The Turtles]], also known as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]]; former [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] from [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from [[The Care Bears Movie]] featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]], who sang lead for [[The Lovin' Spoonful]].

In the midst of the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album came out, as well as ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' the following year.

The cover of both ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'' and ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' advertises another two CDs, called ''Care Bears Share A Smile'' and ''Care Bears Let's Be Friends''. As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.

== Music videos ==
Approximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single "[[I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer]]" from Swedish rock band [[The Cardigans]]' sixth studio album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'', there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.

== Video games ==
A Care Bears game was planned for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="protoCBGame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |title=Care Bears |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |publisher=Atari Protos |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103164456/http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.

In 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, ''Care-a-lot Jamboree'' for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, ''Let's Have a Ball!'' was released. In the same year they were featured in ''Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring'' for the [[V.Smile]] educational game console.

In 2005, they appeared in ''Catch a Star'' (also for the PC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Entertainment briefs column |date=October 15, 2005 |work=[[Ventura County Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Care Bears: Care Quest'' (for the [[Game Boy Advance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Teachers' Picks: Best New Tech |date=May 1, 2006 |work=Scholastic Parent and Child |publisher=Scholastic Press |volume=13 |number=6 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, ''Care Bears Play Day'', was released for the [[V.Smile]] Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.

them, ''Care Bears Share-A-Story'', was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a [[Teddy Ruxpin]]. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as [[The Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears]], [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and the [[Three Little Pigs]]. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/press/pr_050606_CB.aspx |title=Storytime Has Never Been So Magical!

Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.

Additionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Another Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Lastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called ''Hide 'N Seek Care Bears'', comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, ''Tom Jones'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the [[theatre]] or [[film|cinema]], involves "the illusion of being a human person".&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective [[impersonation]]  by an actor.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreomusicology&lt;/ref&gt; Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics.

'''Comics studies''' (also '''comic'''('''s''') '''art studies''', '''sequential art studies'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQhVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''International Journal of Comic Art'', volume 7], 2005, p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''graphic narrative studies''')&lt;ref&gt;Pramod K. Nayar, ''The Indian Graphic Novel: Nation, History and Critique'', Routledge, 2016, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; is an academic field that focuses on [[comics]] and [[sequential art]].  Although comics and [[graphic novel]]s have been generally dismissed as less relevant [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], scholars in fields such as [[semiotics]], [[composition studies]] and [[cultural studies]] are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study.

Not to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of '''comics theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;—which approaches comics critically as an art—and the writing of '''comics historiography'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the study of the [[history of comics]]).&lt;ref name="Crucifix"&gt;Benoît Crucifix, [https://www.academia.edu/25698596/Redrawing_Comics_into_the_Graphic_Novel._Comics_Historiography_Canonization_and_Authors_Histories_of_the_Medium "Redrawing Comics into the Graphic Novel: Comics Historiography, Canonization, and Authors' Histories of the Medium"], "Whither comics studies?" panel, International conference of the French Association for American Studies, Toulouse (France), May 24–27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Comics theory has significant overlap with the '''philosophy of comics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, i.e., the study of the [[ontology]],&lt;ref name="Meskin"&gt;Aaron Meskin, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00450.x/abstract;jsessionid=178329FBF825056FF0EF32CB3F3D8263.f03t01?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= "The Philosophy of Comics"], ''Philosophy Compass'' '''6'''(12), December 2011, pp. 854–864.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Thomson]], in his "Deconstructing the Hero" (in Jeff McLaughlin, ed., ''Comics as Philosophy'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2005), pp. 100–129), develops the concept of comics as philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[epistemology]]&lt;ref&gt;Meskin, Aaron and Roy T. Cook (eds.), ''The Art of Comics: A Philosophical Approach'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Carrier]], ''The Aesthetics of Comics'', Penn State University Press, 2000, Part 1: "The Nature of Comics."&lt;/ref&gt; of comics, the relationship between comics and other art forms, and the relationship between text and image in comics.&lt;ref name="Meskin"/&gt;

Comics studies is also interrelated with '''comics criticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.&lt;ref&gt;Bramlett, Frank, Roy Cook and Aaron Meskin (eds.), ''The Routledge Companion to Comics'', Routledge, 2016, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorizing comics==
Although there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in [[Gilbert Seldes]]' ''The 7 Lively Arts'' (1924), Martin Sheridan's ''Classic Comics and Their Creators'' (1942), and David Kunzle's ''The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825'' (1973), contemporary [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Comics and Sequential Art]]'' in 1985 and [[Scott McCloud]]'s ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' in 1993. [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] comics studies can trace its roots back to the work of semioticians such as [[Roland Barthes]] (particularly his 1964 essay "Rhetoric of the Image", published in English in the anthology ''Image—Music—Text'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], [http://www.persee.fr/doc/comm_0588-8018_1964_num_4_1_1027 "Rhétorique de l'image"], ''Communications'' '''4'''(1), 1964, pp. 40–51, translated as "Rhetoric of the Image", in: Roland Barthes, ''Image–Music–Text'', essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath, New York 1977, pp. 32–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]] (particularly his 1964 book ''Apocalittici e integrati'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], ''Apocalittici e integrati: comunicazioni di massa e teorie della cultura di massa'', Bompiani, 1964. Cf. also: Umberto Eco (1972). "Epilogue", in: Walter Herdeg and David Pascal (eds.): ''The Art of the Comic Strip'', Zurich: The Graphis Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being [[Neil Cohn]], who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying "visual language", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Cohn]], ''The Visual Language of Comics: Introduction to the Structure and Cognition of Sequential Images'', London: Bloomsbury, 2013, p. 1[[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn's theories are not universally accepted with other scholars like [[Thierry Groensteen]], Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings.

===Defining comics===
{{quote box
| source = — [[R. C. Harvey]], 2001{{sfn|Harvey|2001|p=76}}
| width = 30em
|"Comics&amp;nbsp;... are sometimes four-legged and sometimes two-legged and sometimes fly and sometimes don't&amp;nbsp;... to employ a metaphor as mixed as the medium itself, defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&amp;nbsp;..."}}

[[File:Scott McCloud.Making Comics Tour.RISD.gk.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a middle-aged man in glasses|Cartoonist and comics theorist [[Scott McCloud]] ]]

Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=128–129}} no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Theorists such as Töpffer,{{sfn|Thomas|2010|p=158}} [[R.&amp;nbsp;C. Harvey]], [[Will Eisner]],{{sfn|Beaty|2012|p=65}} [[David Carrier]],{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|pp=126, 131}} Alain Rey,{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=124}} and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images,{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=126}}  Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen{{sfn|Grove|2010|pp=17–19}} and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images.{{sfn|Thomas|2010|pp=157, 170}}  Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.{{sfn|Groensteen|2012|p=112–113}}

===Composition studies===
In the field of [[composition studies]], an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and [[visual rhetoric]]. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex [[literacy]].

[[Gunther Kress]] defines multimodality as "the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo Van Leeuwen|title=Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication|page=20|publisher=Arnold Publishers|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply as "any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kress, Gunther and Theo van Leeuwen|title=Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design|edition=2nd|page=177|publisher=Routledge|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristie S. Fleckenstein]] sees the relationship between image and text as "mutually constitutive, mutually infused"—a relationship she names "imageword". Fleckenstein sees "imageword" as offering "a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleckenstein, Kristie|title=Embodied Literacies: Imageword and a Poetics of Teaching|page=2|publisher= Southern Illinois University Press|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dale Jacobs]] sees the reading of comics as a form of "multimodal literacy or [[multiliteracy]], rather than as a debased form of print literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move "toward attending to multimodal literacies" that "shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobs, Dale|title=Marvelling at The Man Called Nova: Comics as Sponsors of Multimodal Literacy|journal=The Journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication|volume=59 | issue = 2 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities.

===Comics historiography&lt;!--'Comicphilia' redirects here--&gt;===
Comics historiography (the study of the [[history of comics]])&lt;ref name="Crucifix"/&gt; studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous [[art medium]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul and James Lyons (eds.), ''The Rise of the American Comics Artist: Creators and Contexts'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and an integral part of culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coulton Waugh|Waugh, Coulton]], ''The Comics'', University Press of Mississippi, 1991, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; An area of study is [[premodern]] sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]]s and [[Egyptian painting|paintings]] and [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas|American]] picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott McCloud]], ''Understanding Comics'', Harper Perennial, 1993, pp. 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the [[subculture]] of comics readers and '''comicphilia'''&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Linck Vargas, [https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/135497 ''A invenção dos quadrinhos: teoria e crítica da sarjeta''] (''The invention of Comics: Theory and Criticism of Gutters''), Ph.D. thesis, Federal University of Santa Catarina, 2015, Abstract: "we stumble upon the inventions of a comics artistry, from the 1960's&lt;!--sic; apostrophe in the original--&gt; on, through conflicts with the art world (Pop Art, Lowbrow Art and exhibitions), through the emergence of an authorial disposal and of an institutionalized comicphilia..."&lt;/ref&gt; (the passionate interest in comic books).

==Educational institutions==
Comics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world. Some notable examples include: [[University of Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/study.shtml |title=UF &amp;#124; Comics Studies &amp;#124; Studying Comics at UF |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Toronto Mississauga|University of Toronto at Mississauga]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/dvs/programs/visual-culture-studies Visual Culture Studies - University of Toronto Mississauga].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of California Santa Cruz]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Art Spiegelman|Spiegelman, Art]]. "Comix 101." Lecture. Porter College, University of California, Santa Cruz, April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. [[West Liberty University]] is currently the only university offering a four-year undergraduate literature degree in comics studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westliberty.edu/humanities/programs/english-major-graphic-narrative-track/ Graphic Narrative Major]&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, growing interest in comics has led to the establishment of a center for comics studies, the Scottish Centre for Comics Studies (SCCS) at the [[University of Dundee]] in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scottishcomicstudies.com/ |title=Scottish Centre for Comics Studies |publisher=scottishcomicstudies.com |accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside formal programs and degrees, it is common to see individual courses dedicated to comics and graphic novels in many educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/teaching/ |title=UF &amp;#124; Comics Studies &amp;#124; Teaching Comics |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date=2007-04-09 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sol M. Davidson's [[New York University]] [[thesis]], ''Culture and the Comic Strips'', earned him the first PhD in comics in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Sol M. ''Culture and the Comic Strips.'' Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/comics/davidson_coll.html Sol &amp; Penny Davison Collection - George A. Smathers Libraries].&lt;/ref&gt; while in France, [[Jean-Christophe Menu]] was awarded a [[Art.D.|Doctorate in Art and Art Sciences]] in 2011 from [[Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne]] after defending his thesis ''The Comics and its Double: Language and Frontiers of Comics: Practical, Theoretical and Editorial Prospects''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du9.org/syn-these Article about Jean-Christophe Menu presenting his thesis at the Sorbonne].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theses.fr/2011PA010503 Theses.fr: ''La bande dessinée et son double : langage et marges de la bande dessinée : perspectives pratiques, théoriques et éditoriales''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teesside University]] began offering a BA in Comics and Graphic Novels in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tees.ac.uk/prospectus/ug/UG_course.cfm?courseid=1265&amp;fos=4&amp;fossub=5 |title=Teesside University Comics and Graphic Novels BA |publisher=Teesside University |date= |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an MA in Comics from 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tees.ac.uk/postgraduate_courses/The_Arts/MA_Comics_and_Graphic_Novels.cfm |title=Teesside University Comics MA |publisher=Teesside University |date= |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since appointed a team of renowned comics practitioners including Fionnuala Doran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2016/08/11/news/the-graphic-tale-of-irish-revolutionary-roger-casement-644783/ |title=The graphic tale of Irish revolutionary Roger Casement |publisher=The Irish News |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Lawrence]], [[Con Chrisoulis]], [[Nigel Kitching]] and Tara McInerney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taramcinerney.com/ |title=Tara McInerney Website |publisher=Tara McInerney |accessdate=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Lancaster]] started offering a PhD degree in comics studies in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/lancaster-university-offers-doctorate-in-comic-books-a6748651.html |title=Lancaster University offers doctorate in comic books |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2015-11-25 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year French comics studies scholar [[Benoît Peeters]] (a student of Roland Barthes) was appointed as the UK's first ever comics professor at Lancaster University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/26/great-snakes-tintin-expert-appointed-uks-first-comics-professor |title='Great snakes!' Tintin expert appointed UK's first comics professor  |publisher=TheGuardian.com |date=2015-11-26 |accessdate=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly publications==
Since 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: ''Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics'', ''Studies in Comics'', and ''European Comic Art''. Other notable journals include: ''ImageTexT'' (a [[peer review]]ed, [[open access journal]] that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the [[University of Florida]]), ''Image and Narrative'' (stylized as ''Image [&amp;] Narrative'', a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on [[visual narratology]]), ''SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education'' (based at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]]), ''Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society'' (published by the [[Ohio State University Press]]), ''The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship'', and the ''[[International Journal of Comic Art]]''.

==Conferences==
Although presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|SAIC]] (International Comic Arts Forum), [[Manchester Metropolitan University|MMU]] (The International Bande Dessinée Society Conference), [[University of Technology Sydney|UTS]] (Sequential Art Studies Conference), [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] (Festival of Cartoon Art),&lt;ref name="Con"&gt;[http://www.comicsresearch.org/academic.html "Regularly Held Conferences"].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] (Comics in Popular Culture conference),&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Weiner (ed.), ''Graphic Novels and Comics in Libraries and Archives: Essays on Readers, Research, History and Cataloging'', McFarland, 2010, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a yearly conference at [[University of Florida]] (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/comics/conference.shtml |work=www.english.ufl.edu|title=Comics Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is an annual [[Michigan State University]] Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for [[Humor Studies]].&lt;ref name="Con"/&gt;

The International Comics Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University by Guy Spielmann and Tristan Fonlladosa, is an annual academic conference distinguished by its international focus and scholarly rigor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=internationalcomicartsforum.org|url=http://www.internationalcomicartsforum.org/about-icaf.html|title=The History of ICAF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The German ''Gesellschaft für Comicforschung'' (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicgesellschaft.de/?page_id=4&amp;lang=en|title=Gesellschaft für Comicforschung|date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comics Arts Conference]] has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] and [[WonderCon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicsforum.org/2014/02/22/the-comics-arts-conference-and-public-humanities-by-kathleen-mcclancy/ ''The Comics Arts Conference and Public Humanities''].&lt;/ref&gt; Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessinée Society conference. ''Comics Forum'', a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at [[Leeds Central Library]]; the first was held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comicsforum.org/|title=Comics Forum|website=Comics Forum|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Documentary practice''' is the process of creating documentary projects.  It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentary films or other similar presentations based on fact or reality.  Colleges and universities offer courses and programs in documentary practice (see External Links).

Traditional definitions put forth by scholars of documentary film address documentary practice in terms of formal codes, categories and conventions.  These are  used by filmmakers to create "non-fictional" representations of the historical world.&lt;ref&gt;''Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary,'' [[Bill Nichols]], Indiana University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent definitions made by others define various approaches to documentary in terms of how they use such [[rhetorical]] strategies as voice, structure and style.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric and Representation in Nonfiction Film,'' Carl Platinga, Cambridge University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Such definitions focus on finished documentary projects and how they measure up to contemporary notions of truth and representation.

However, recent cultural, technological, stylistic, and social shifts have turned attention in documentary studies to the process of documenting as such. Documentary-makers and scholars alike are showing  interest in the present moment and how new media tools can be used by documentary-makers to initiate formation of new communities, conversations, and ways of being together.

Such interests characterized [[Conceptual Art]] works of the 1960s and 1970s.  The connective potentialities of art as a practice are currently being explored in the contemporary [[Relational Aesthetics]] movement.  In these movements, the potentialities and dilemmas of aesthetic practice take precedence over traditional concerns with the finished artwork.  Likewise, growing interest in documentary as a practice is opening the definition of documentary beyond considerations of finished documents, to include the act of documenting itself.  This expansion of the definition of documentary work became possible when consumer-level video cameras became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collective Camcorder in Art and Activism: 1968-2000'', Jesse Drew.  In ''Collectivism After Modernism,'', B. Stimson and G. Shollette, eds., University of Minnesota Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some collectives of video producers used this new technology to address issues such as politics of cultural representation, the critique of daily life, the deconstruction of culture control mechanisms, and the subversion of authority.

While practices of documentary-makers continue to be informed by existing documentary traditions, [[Conventions in documentary]], and genres, they are also reshaped by emerging media environments, content, devices and uses for those devices.  Emerging media, in turn, are greatly affected by their political, economic, and cultural contexts. Various emerging technologies and the situations in which they are used present documentary-makers with new challenges, opportunities, and dilemmas. This makes documentary practice dynamic and ever-evolving.

Many documentary-makers seek innovative approaches to their field in response to emerging technologies and the practices they make possible. Continuous innovation in documentary practice prevents the "documentary idea"&lt;ref&gt;''The Documentary Idea: A Critical History of English-Language Documentary Film and Video,'' Jack C. Ellis, Prentice Hall, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Documentary Work,'' Robert Coles, Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; from becoming stagnant or locked into any single generic form.  This challenges each generation of documentary-makers and viewers to approach documentary-making as a living practice.

== Emerging media ==
New documentary practices associated with [[cinéma vérité]] and [[Direct Cinema]] began to appear in the mid-1950s when technological developments made film and then [[video]] more portable, accessible and affordable.  This allowed more people to engage in the practice of documenting. The 1991 video of [[Rodney King]] being subjected to police restraint is an example of the continuing power of this shift.  An ordinary citizen was able to capture the [[police brutality]] with his camcorder, transforming him from a witness to an amateur documentary filmmaker. Scholars have cited the events following the widespread dissemination of the Rodney King video as one of the earliest examples of "[[participatory culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Media Change: The Aesthetics of Transition,'' [[Henry Jenkins]], MIT Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[new media]] continue to reshape documentary practices in significant ways.  Recording technologies embedded within personal portable devices such as video-equipped [[mobile phones]] and hand-held [[digital video]] and still cameras have made it possible for vast numbers of people to engage in [[citizen journalism]] and "documentary practices." Additionally, [[Web 2.0]] platforms such as video and photo-sharing websites and [[blogs]] now enable amateur "documentarians" to share and collaborate on content in ways never before possible. A practice that [[Howard Rheingold]] and [[Justin Hall]] have labeled ''[[Peer-to-peer (meme)|p2p Journalism]],'' now exists at the blurred boundary where traditional definitions of [[journalism]] and [[Documentary film|documentary]] meet and influence each other.

Promises of new media technologies have raised expectations of a freer flow of ideas and content.  Scholars are studying how participants in documenting practices engage in the social process of acquiring knowledge, sharing stories, and documenting events-in-the-making.  Through such practices, social ties among people and groups as they arbitrate what qualifies as knowledge evolve continuously, facilitating the emergence of what [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] refers to as ''[[collective intelligence]]''.

By enabling more people to record and share their experiences, emerging media technologies have transformed the way people document reality and how they participate in the very events that they are documenting.  Everyday life can become performative as people respond to encounters and events through documentary practices, creating records of daily life which they then share with others via the Internet.  For many people, digital media-making becomes a form of documentary practice when the results are created for and shared via social-networking sites like [[MySpace]], [[Flickr]] and [[Facebook]].

The 2006 documentary of a [[Beastie Boys]] concert, ''Awesome; I F***n' Shot That!'', directed by [[Adam Yauch]], is an example of how participation in documentary practices transforms the way people take part in events such as concerts. A live performance in 2004 was documented by 50 fans who were all given Hi8 cameras and told to film their experience of the concert.  Their footage was later edited together with professionally shot footage.  It provided contrasting points of view and established dialogue between artists and fans.&lt;ref&gt;''Awesome I F***n' Shot That!: User-Generated Content in Documentary Film, online at http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit5/papers/Porst AwesomePaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that as an increasingly widespread practice, the nascent cellphone documentary genre creates more possibilities and forms of social agency; people use cell phones to document public events and network their collective responses;&lt;ref&gt;''Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution,'' Howard Rheingold, Perseus Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; others have used their phones to mobilize crowds during public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cell Phone and the Crowd: Messianic Politics in the Contemporary Philippines,'', Rafael Vincente, published in ''Public Culture'' Vol. 15 No. 3, 2003.  Vincente writes: "The crowd itself takes on a kind of communicative power, serving up channels for sending messages at a distance and bringing distances up close."  http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/f_rafael_cellphonerev_files.htm_{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile communications devices ==
The pursuit of "filmic truth" has been a hallmark of documentary practice since early film-makers such as the [[Lumiere Brothers]], [[Robert Flaherty]] and [[Dziga Vertov]] created its foundations. (see External Links)

Today, people use mobile devices in ways that open new possibilities for the practices of documenting—especially those practices involved in efforts to achieve "filmic truth."  For example, in June 2006 a 93-minute remake of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s documentary entitled ''[[Love Meetings]]'' (1965), in which he interviewed Italian citizens about their views on sex in postwar Italy, was shot entirely on a cell phone by [[:it:Marcello Mencarini]] and [[Barbara Seghezzi]]. Entitled ''New Love Meetings'', the remake was filmed in MPEG4 format using a Nokia N90. It is the first feature-length movie to be shot entirely on a mobile phone.   Their premise was that even though they asked their subjects the same questions that Pasolini had posed, the results of their documentary would be clearly influenced by the medium they used to capture the images. They believed that the use of a cellphone, an instrument of daily life, produced an intimacy absent in Pasolini's movie, making people more spontaneous and open, creating a dialogue more like a chat than an interview. They propose that the line between subject and observer becomes thinner through such practices, as the documentary film-makers present themselves as "normal people" using their cell phones to preserve an instant.  ''New Love Meetings'' is a prime example of how a specific emerging technology, the mobile phone, is shifting documentary practice today. (see External Links)

The use of the so-called "[[fourth screen]]" (the first screen being cinema, the second television, the third the computer, the fourth the mobile device) as a documentary tool has become a subject of academic study. In fall of 2007, graduate students of [[The New School]] produced an experimental five-minute metadocumentary shot with three cell phones.  It explored the possibilities of mobile media devices as a medium for documentary practice by using them to restate Dziga Vertov's perspectives on filmic truth as expressed in his film: ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''.

'== '''Surveillance media
[[Surveillance]] is the act of observation or monitoring, usually of places, people, and activity, and typically without the subject's knowledge. Much of contemporary surveillance involves observation from a distance with the help of electronic devices, such as [[telephone tapping]], [[Parabolic microphone|directional microphones]], [[covert listening device]]s or "bugs", [[subminiature camera]]s, [[closed-circuit television]], [[GPS tracking|GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking]], [[electronic tagging]], [[Video tracking|motion tracking]], [[satellite]]s, [[Computer surveillance|internet and computer surveillance]].

Historically, surveillance has often been associated with governmental and other large organizational security practices.  However, artists and activists have challenged those conventional practices.  An early example is the film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'', made by artist [[Andy Warhol]] in 1964.  It consisted of an extreme long shot of the [[Empire State Building]], held for eight hours in real time, challenging the boundaries of surveillance and watchability. More recently, scholars such as UCLA cinema professor Steve Mamber, have turned attention to the growing trend of using inexpensive, small cameras to unobtrusively record events of daily life. To examine hidden-camera video practices, in 2003 Mamber asked acquaintances if they or anyone they knew might have access to such footage, creating an online archive of the footage. Mamber described the growing practice as "both a widely pervasive activity and an oddly unexamined one."  In response, he established the UCLA Center for Hidden Camera Research, another example of how emerging technologies are shifting documentary practice. (see External Links)

Another practice that has emerged from the introduction of new surveillance technologies is "inverse surveillance", also known as [[Sousveillance]]. Launched in 2004, CARPE (Capture, Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences)is a project conceived with the idea of recording and archiving one's whole life. Some of the technologies developed within this project have become potential new tools of documentary practice.  For example, the [[EyeTap]], developed by University of Toronto Professor Steve Mann, presents itself as an ideal device for continuous and inconspicuous recording as well as inverse surveillance.

Some scholars assert that these new devices enable us to imagine a new form of citizenship (the "monitorial citizen") that hinges on documentary practices. This concept is illustrated by parents watching their small children at the community pool. They look inactive, but they are poised for action if action is required. The emphasis is not so much on information gathering as it is on keeping a watchful eye—even while the monitorial citizen is doing something else.&lt;ref&gt;''Changing Concepts of Democracy,'' [[Michael Schudson]], http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/schudson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects such as The Canary Project's photographic monitoring of global warming effects (see External Links) and the [[Center for Land Use Interpretation]]'s Data Base of citizen-created documentation of land use practices exemplify the link between surveillance, emerging documentary practices and monitorial citizenship.

The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in partnership with [[Amnesty International]], presents another example of how new media are allowing surveillance and documentary practices to inform each other.  This partnership uses [[satellite imagery]] to help [[NGO]]s  document atrocities in isolated crisis zones such as [[Darfur]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. By purchasing images from commercial satellites that correspond to mapping coordinates, NGOs are increasingly able to provide visual evidence of refugee camps and burned villages; events and activities that would be impossible to image without the satellite technology. (see External Links)

== Mapping applications ==
Traditionally, [[map]]s have been created to orient people.  They have delineated boundaries by using static, two-dimensional symbols to represent dynamic, three-dimensional spaces that undergo continual change. Both form and content are fixed in these traditional maps, leaving out the real-time experiences of those people who live in and define the space being represented.  However, the proliferation of portable media devices that can record and distribute digital images, video, audio and text, combined with the capability to reach previously unreachable audiences via the Web and through vast wireless networks, now makes it possible to transform conventional maps into living documents.

New, map-based documentary practices employ maps as useful tools for interrogating the present, transforming maps from static representations into events-in-the-making.  Personal narratives, experiences, and memories are being used to create maps that represent social and cultural space as well as physical space.  Often, the goal in such projects is to evoke a more diverse and dynamic portrait of human experience as it is actually lived. (see External Links)

For example, programs that involve community members and youth in active community mapping for social empowerment include [[Amigos de las Américas]], Video Machete in Chicago, as well as Community Youth Mapping and Mapping Within (see External Links).  There have been significant efforts to use community mapping practices to promote environmentally sound practices, including [[Green Map]]ping (see External Link) which involves locals in identifying and siting (on a map) ecology-minded ("green") businesses, spaces, and organizations.  A recent California effort involves citizens in mapping forest fires and related community action plan. A variety of resources are available to support those involved in mapping, including resource lists, guidelines, and lesson plans. (see External Links)

Sonic representations of place, sometimes called "soundmaps," challenge traditional assumptions of what maps can do and offer new ways of participating in documentary practice. Soundmaps extend opportunities for defining place and expressing local culture, and they offer the added dimension of time. By enabling the integration of sound, text, still and moving images, mapping uniquely allows for more choices of representation and documentation without necessarily privileging one form above the rest.  By doing so, voice is given to more ways of knowing and expressing—including '[[remixing]]', for example—in a way that recognizes and affirms the diversity of experiences and representations within communities. (see External Links)

The emergence of the ''[[Geoweb]]'' is another example of how changes in the ways people document geographical space is also broadening notions of documentary practice. ''Geoweb'' refers to virtual maps or "geobrowsers" such as [[Google Earth]] that allow users to search for images, texts, videos or other media content through interactive, photographic maps of the earth. All information on a geoweb is organized by geographic tags tied to a particular location on the map. Since its inception, usage of the Geoweb has been widespread and varied; including  recreational, humanitarian, political and military uses. (see External Links) New mapping technologies make new documentary practices imaginable by allowing documentary producers to locate, store, share, and network images and information that capture the ever-shifting landscapes of the world, updated in real-time.
 
On the global scale, access to new media with potential to generate new documentary practices is still confined to an economically privileged few, giving rise to the ''[[digital divide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''You Call This A Democracy?'' (afterword), Paul Kivel, APEX, 2004, http://www.cipa-apex.org/books/you_call_this_a_democracy/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the first digital divide was largely due to economics and politics of broadband cable and expensive computers needed to access the internet.  With the proliferation of wireless networks and mobile phones, the divide has diminished considerably, as more remote areas are easier to reach through wireless signals and mobile devices are far less expensive than computers.  While there is great potential for new technologies to continue to broaden definitions of documentary practice, enabling more people to collaborate and “document from within” their own communities, questions about who controls and regulates the networks and distribution methods as well as the increasingly advanced skill needed to fully participate in emerging practices will likely be a core question for some time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1075">A '''duodrama''' is a theatrical [[melodrama]] for two [[actor]]s or singers, in which the spoken voice is used with a musical accompaniment for heightened dramatic effect. It was popular at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Closely related to [[opera]], the most famous example were the 1775 works ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' and ''[[Medea (Benda)|Medea]]'' by [[Georg Benda]]. [[Mozart]] admired Benda's work and used similar techniques in ''[[Zaide]]'' (1780) and ''[[Thamos, König in Ägypten]]'' (c. 1773-1780). He considered writing a duodrama himself, to be called ''Semiramis''. [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805-1814) and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) also contain duodramas. The style is also used in [[lieder]] and song. &lt;ref&gt;Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 782 pages,  {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnic theme parks''' are theme parks based on demonstrating the traditions and cultures of a multitude of ethnic groups. In China, Windows Around the World and [[Happy Valley Beijing]] are two examples of these parks which, due to their unique potpourris of heritages, attract tourists worldwide.  The ethnic theme parks are advertised as a way to glimpse into different areas around the world in one easy visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired Humanities Projects, University of Oregon|url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/chinatheme/tours/ethnic-tour.html|work=Chinese Theme Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout allocates a separate “village” to each [[ethnic group]], allowing tourists and other visitors to absorb the individuality they portray.  Heritage and history are simulated through elaborate costumes and roles. Visitors also have an opportunity to participate in some of the cultural practices of various ethnic groups and to engage in a question and answer based discussion.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"&gt;Gordon, Tamara, and Bruce Caron. ''Global Villages: The Globalization of Ethnic Display''. New York: Tourist Gaze Productions, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The precise infrastructure of each park is different, but each aims to provide a display case for as many cultural identities as possible. At ''Windows Around the World'', for example, national heritage is classified into three categories: primitive song and dance, professional modifications, and further creative modifications.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

==Controversy==
A debate over authenticity has been sparked in light of the fact that several employees represent nationalities separate from their own individual heritages. The [[Wa people]], for instance, play the roles of African ethnic groups, while [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are portrayed by ethnic [[Mongols|Mongolians]].&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

Disputes also linger over the degree to which governments and corporations seek to mask and embellish what they wish within the walls of the park. According to Thomas Mullaney, a Stanford University historian, these parks are highly politicized venues which seek to shape the popular view of China as a multiethnic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=China's Han Flock to Theme Parks Featuring Minorities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/asia/24park.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorative strategies''' are used in drama to explore a theme or a text. They are associated with Edexcel GCSE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Types of strategies==
*''' Forum Theatre''' - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest.
*'''Thought Tracking''' - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc.
*'''Still Image''' - Also known as a "[[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]" or "tableau" or "snapshot" or "qais", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage.
*'''Hot Seating''' - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an "in class" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc.
*'''Cross Cutting''' - When time in a scene changes to show  what happens before or after a scene.
*'''Narrating''' - A character, normally called the "Narrator", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot
*'''Marking the moment''' - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc..
*'''Role-play''' - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16569">'''Game development kits''' ('''GDK''') are specialized [[computer hardware|hardware]] used to create commercial [[video game|videogames]]. They may be partnered with game development tools, special [[game engine]] licenses, and other [[middleware]] to aid [[video game development]]. GDKs are typically not available to the public, and require [[video game developers|game developers]] to enter an agreement, partnership, or program with the hardware manufacturer to gain access to the hardware. As [[Video game console|game console]] generations pass, development kits often get sold through websites like eBay without repercussions. This is often because the console manufacturers discontinue certain development programs as time passes.

== Overview ==
In the 1980s, computing did not involve  3D modelling or any complex programming due to the limitations of hardware.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Life and Times of an 80’s Game Programmer – Putting it all together {{!}} Play It Again|url = http://playitagainproject.org/the-life-and-times-of-an-80s-game-programmer-putting-it-all-together/|website = playitagainproject.org|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the hobbyist nature of early computer game programming, meant that not many individuals or smaller companies would develop for consoles. Even when consoles became mainstream (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System), there was no official or publicly available GDK since most console manufacturers would develop their games in-house. For example, Nintendo had internal development teams for both hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Here’s How Nintendo’s Internal Teams are Organized|url = http://www.gamnesia.com/news/heres-how-nintendos-internal-teams-are-organized|website = www.gamnesia.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth generation of consoles, game development kits were developed to encourage more developers to make console games and grow the videogame industry. Game development kits began as a simple way for developers to connect their computers to console hardware, allowing them to compile software on their PC and see it play directly on a console. Once most GDKs started becoming bundled with hardware-specific software, hobbyists or anyone not directly affiliated with a console manufacturer would have to write their games without the specialized software to access unique features such as the Xbox One's Kinect or the Wii U GamePad.

Modern game development kits often come bundled with the specialized software, and are much more formalized compared to previous-generation GDKs. In older generations of console gaming, developers had to make their own hardware and write games at various levels of programming (such as assembly&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;). Today, programs such as Unity 3D provide a complete software environment and console manufacturers such as Nintendo provide polished &amp; powerful development hardware through their developer programs. Other console manufacturers even allow the retail consoles to be used as development kits, provided that the development software is being used by the developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Microsoft: Every Xbox One Can Be Used To Make Games [UPDATE]|url = http://kotaku.com/microsoft-every-xbox-one-can-be-used-to-make-games-up-898750954|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third-generation videogame development kits ==
[[File:NES-MissionCtrlRAMCartDebug1.jpg|alt=The NES Mission Control debug cartridge.|thumb|174x174px|The NES Mission Control debug cartridge.]]

=== Nintendo Entertainment System ===
For a significant portion of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] lifespan, there was no official development kit. Video game developers creating games for the NES would have to make their own development kits, such as Rocket Science Production with their "NES Mission Control" development system. At least two programs were used in conjunction with the NES Mission Control hardware; NESTEST.EXE which would be used to test and debug the development hardware, and HST.EXE which would be used for communication between a computer and the NES development hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NES Mission Control Development System|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/NES_MissionControl.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fourth-generation videogame development kits ==

=== Super Nintendo Entertainment System ===
The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] used specialized [[EPROM]] cartridges for development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SNES 8 MB EPROM Cartridge|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/SNES_8MBEPROM.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various software. Similar to the NES, developers often made their own development software or relied on middleware made by other developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NES/SNES Utilities - Zophar's Domain|url = http://www.zophar.net/utilities/nesdev.html|website = www.zophar.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SNES Development Wiki|url = http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/HomePage|website = Super Nintendo Development Wiki|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fifth-generation video game development kits ==

=== PlayStation ===
[[File:Playstation Blue Developer Console.jpg|alt=The developer version of the PlayStation; a blue console.|thumb|The developer version of the PlayStation; a blue console.]]
The are several variations of the [[PlayStation]] development kit used for game creation. One variation of the development kit had only three components,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Store {{!}} PSXDEV|url = http://www.psxdev.net/store.html|website = www.psxdev.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the PlayStation Ultimate Development Kit included up to 26 components, including the complete [[Net Yaroze]] development kit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Things you can't ever have|url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/interactive/thingsyoucanteverhave3.html|website = www.platypuscomix.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Net Yaroze]] version of the development kit was unique in that it had some features removed and added compared to the official (complete) PlayStation development kit. The Net Yaroze hardware was designed for hobbyists, while official developers would have access to the official PlayStation development kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15 Years Later: How Sony's Net Yaroze Kickstarted Indie Console Development|url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/169245/15_years_later_how_sonys_net_.php|website = www.gamasutra.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a blue version of the PlayStation made for developers that would read burned discs to allow quick testing of imaged builds of their videogames. While there were official PlayStation-branded CD-Rs that could be used with the blue PlayStation, regular CD-Rs were also compatible with the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nintendo 64/64DD ===
[[File:N64 Gangwriter.jpg|alt=The Nintendo 64 Gangwriter used to duplicate games across cartridges.|thumb|The Nintendo 64 Gangwriter used to duplicate games across cartridges.]]
The [[Nintendo 64]] development kit consisted of multiple components, both for the N64 and its add-on, the N64DD. The main hardware used in N64 game development was the Partner-N64 Development Kit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nintendo 64 Development {{!}} level42|url = http://level42.ca/projects/nintendo-64-development/|website = level42.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used tall cartridges for game development/testing rather than the short cartridges that were sold with retail games. Another hardware component in N64 development was the NU64 Flash Gang Writer, which allowed developers to copy data from one cartridge to multiple cartridges simultaneously. This device was primarily used to create press and test copies of games, and also relied on tall cartridges instead of short retail cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NESWORLD.COM - NU64 FLASH GANG WRITER (NINTENDO64 DEVELOPMENT TOOL)|url = http://www.nesworld.com/n64-gangwriter.php|website = www.nesworld.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the Nintendo 64 GDK are the SN Systems development suite, as well as the SN Maestro 64 Music development system. The development suite allowed developers to run code from a computer directly to the console, and included a software package. The Maestro 64 Music system allowed developers to load music software on to the console, and play music through the Nintendo 64's hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nintendo 64 SN64 Dev Kit and SN Maestro 64 Music Dev Kit|url = http://devkits.handheldmuseum.com/SN64.htm|website = devkits.handheldmuseum.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sixth-generation video game development kits ==

=== Dreamcast ===
[[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] units were unique in that they used "GD-ROM" discs; giga discs that held 1GB of data. This was slightly more than a typical CD, but less than a DVD. While GD-ROM burners were used by some developers, since the Dreamcast was compatible with CDs and since most games didn't take up 1GB of data at the time, GD-ROMs remained uncommon as developers opted to use the more-easily accessible CDs for their disc media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Things you can't ever have|url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/interactive/thingsyoucanteverhave.html|website = www.platypuscomix.net|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xbox ===
When developers were creating software for the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], a prototype of the controller was used in the early development kits. This controller was slimmer, had elongated sides, and used a [[USB]] cable instead of an Xbox port-compatible cable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Seventh-generation video game development kits ==

=== Xbox 360 ===
[[Microsoft]] manages the [[Xbox 360]] Tools and Middleware Program, which licenses development kits (hardware and software) to professional software developers working on tools and technologies for games. Access to this program requires good industry references, prior experience in games tools and middleware development, and signing a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program|url = http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/xbox/tools|website = www.xbox.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PlayStation 3 ===
The PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the [[PlayStation Network]], making their games accessible on the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[PlayStation TV]] all through one program.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Develop|url = https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/|website = PlayStation|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Original-wii-dev-kit-10-years-ago-640x430.jpg|alt=The original Nintendo Wii development hardware.|thumb|The original Wii development hardware.]]

=== Wii ===
The [[Wii]] development kit was a bundle of the "NDEV" hardware - a big black box full of debugging/testing hardware that looks nothing like the slim white Wii consoles sold to consumers - and a disc containing the developer software tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This is the original Wii dev kit that shipped to developers 10 years ago|url = http://wiiudaily.com/2015/08/this-is-the-original-wii-dev-kit-that-shipped-to-developers-10-years-ago/|website = wiiudaily.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eighth-generation video game development kits ==

=== Xbox One ===
[[Microsoft]] maintains multiple developer programs for people wanting to develop games for their platforms; ID@Xbox for [[Xbox One]] [[Game Development|game development]], and the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] Dev Center for [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], [[Windows 10]], and Xbox One game and application development. 
* The ID@Xbox program allows qualified game developers to [[Self-publishing|self-publish]] their games to the Xbox One, as well as access free middleware and use two development hardware kits for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Independent Developer publishing program for Xbox One|url = http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/developers/id|website = www.xbox.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Windows Dev Center allows developers to create apps and games on [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 8.1]], and [[Windows 10]] platforms as part of the [[Universal Windows Platform]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get started with Windows apps - Windows app development|url = https://dev.windows.com/en-us/getstarted|website = dev.windows.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita ===
The [[PlayStation]] developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the [[PlayStation Network]], making their games accessible on the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[PlayStation TV]] all through one program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The PlayStation 4 development kits were known as "Orbis", though this was just a codename.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Report: Xbox 720 And PS4 Codenames And Details - IGN|url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/11/report-xbox-720-and-ps4-codenames-and-details|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115164704/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/11/report-xbox-720-and-ps4-codenames-and-details|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-01-15|website = IGN|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academic institution]]s can register to receive PS4 development kits for educational use, and are not region-restricted unlike regular PlayStation Developer Program members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PlayStation® Academic Program |url=https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/gdc-2015/academic-program/ |website=PlayStation |accessdate=2015-11-25 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126034408/https://www.playstation.com/en-us/develop/gdc-2015/academic-program/ |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wii U ===
[[Nintendo]] maintains a unified developer program for both its Wii U and Nintendo 3DS families of platforms. This developer program provides software and middleware to developers, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.nintendo.com/|title=Homepage - Nintendo Developer Portal|website=developer.nintendo.com|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games and applications published through this program are considered "third-party" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.

The Wii U development hardware consists of a system called "CAT-DEV", with its accompanying peripherals such as the Display Remote Controller (presumably the [[Wii U GamePad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wii U dev kit {{!}} Wii U|url = http://wiiudaily.com/wii-u-dev-kit/|website = wiiudaily.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and sensor bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wii U Devkit (CAT-DEV V3) - VGLeaks|url = http://www.vgleaks.com/wii-u-devkit-cat-dev-v3|website = VGLeaks|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nintendo 3DS Family ===
Nintendo's developer program allows developers to use Nintendo 3DS development kits, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As mentioned in the Nintendo Wii U section above, games and applications published through this program are considered "third-party" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.

Strangely, some 3DS development kits cannot play [[ROM cartridge|retail games]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Gender by comics format.PNG|thumb|right|400px|More than 40% of female, [[transgender]], and [[non-binary]] comic artists reported to be working in webcomics in June 2015, while less than 15% of male comic artists did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sktchd.com/longform/is-gender-a-determinant-for-how-much-a-comic-artist-earns/|work=SKTCHD|title=SKTCHD Survey: Is Gender a Determinant for How Much a Comic Artist Earns?|last=Harper|first=David|date=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/money-in-comics-survey-by-gender/ |publisher=''[[Comics Alliance]]'' |title=Where's the Money in Comics?

In contrast with mainstream American comics, [[webcomics]] are primarily written and drawn by [[women]] and [[gender variant]] people. Because of the [[self-published]] nature of [[webcomics]], the internet has become a successful platform for social commentary, as well as [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) expression.

==Statistics==
A 2015 study by David Harper concluded that webcomics were vastly more popular format to female, transgender, and [[non-binary]] comic artists than for men. More than 40% of the women, transgender, and non-binary comic artists reported to work primarily in webcomics in this study, while only 15% of men did. Harper suggested that this may be because the self-published nature of webcomics form a lower barrier to entry, while traditional mediums such as [[comic books]] are [[gatekeeper|gatekept]] by [[cisgender]] men, though he also suggested that this disparity may just be a difference in interest between the groups.&lt;ref name=Graph /&gt;

According to a study by Erik Melander in 2005, at least 25% of webcomic creators were female. This percentage was significantly larger than the number of successful women creating print comics at the time, and the number may have been even higher, as a certain percentage of contributors were unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/001/786/610/RUG01-001786610_2012_0001_AC.pdf|publisher=[[Universiteit Gent]]|title="Man, you split wood like a girl."

''[[Girls with Slingshots]]'' creator Danielle Corsetto stated that webcomics are probably a female dominated field because there is no need to go through an established publisher. [[Noelle Stevenson]], creator of ''[[Nimona]]'' and ''[[Lumberjanes]]'', noticed that webcomics predominantly feature female protagonists, possibly to "balance out" the content of mainstream media. Corsetto noted that she has never encountered [[sexism]] during her career, though Stevenson described some negative experiences with [[Reddit]] and [[4Chan]], websites outside of her usual channels.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44528|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Women in Comics: Stevenson &amp; Corsetto on Webcomics and the Future|last=Campbell|first=Josie|date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V.

In India, where [[Rape in India|rape of women has been a big issue]] in the 2010s, [[Indian webcomics]] formed a platform for artists to poke fun at [[patriarchy]], [[feminism]], and various other gender-related topics. According to [[human rights activist]] and webcomic creator [[Rachita Taneja]], humor aids in communicating complex subjects to large groups of people, and the inclusiveness of webcomics makes it an excellent medium for said communication.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/buzz/stick-figure-activism-this-highly-vocal-webcomic-that-you-need-to-go-through-today-1210134.html|publisher=''[[IBN Live]]''|title=Stick-figure activism: A clever webcomic that talks about everything that's wrong with our country|last=Sanyal|first=Pathikrit|date=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/a-new-superhero-has-emerged-the-web-comic/story-jYYfrJYwj9D0yJOnHvOPJN.html|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|title=A new superhero has emerged, the web comic|last=Choksi|first=Nidhi|date=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girlamatic]] was a subscriber-based webcomic site founded by [[Joey Manley]] in 2003. The website's purpose was to syndicate webcomics created primarily by women and marketed primarily to women. Girlamatic included webcomics created by various well-known female webcomic artists, including [[Shaenon Garrity]] and [[Lea Hernandez]]. The syndicate had won various [[List of Lulu Award winners|Lulu awards]] for being among the "most women-friendly and reader- friendly work in comics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://friendsoflulu.wordpress.com/lulu-awards/|publisher=''[[Friends of Lulu]]''|title=Lulu Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Comixpedia'', [[Eric Burns]] voiced his worries that initiatives like Girlamatic section off and divide the webcomic community, making it ''less'' likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|publisher=''Comixpedia''|title=Feeding Snarky|last=Burns|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Burns|date=2005-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419052623/http://www.comixpedia.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2352&amp;topic=55&amp;newlang=|archive-date=2005-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==

&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

      <comment>/* Dryden in 1670 */</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

'''''Hot Tub''''' is a weekly [[variety show]] hosted by [[Kurt Braunohler]] and [[Kristen Schaal]]. The show features a mix of [[alternative comedy]] from unknown performers to more established comedians. In 2005, Hot Tub was voted “Best Variety Show” by Time-Out New York’s reader poll and has quickly become one of L.A.’s most popular live comedy events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/14/entertainment/la-et-st-kurt-braunohler-20130414|title=Kurt Braunohler's kind of comedy hits streets, heights|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first seven years the show saw considerable success at Littlefied's in Brooklyn, New York. In 2013, under the helm of [[The Super Serious Show]] producers CleftClips, Hot Tub relocated to the West Coast at The Virgil in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/laculture/culturefilesblog/2013/04/01/witty-when-wet-a-new-show-gets-into-the-hot-tub|title=Witty When Wet: A New Show Gets Into The Hot Tub|work=Los Angeles Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==

Hot Tub harbors comedy acts that are unusual, odd, experimental, and generally free-wheeling. The show is also a venue in which well-known comedians try out new material and more eccentric bits. There is a great deal of [[Improvisational theatre|improv]], absurd performance art, and audience interaction in many performances. Much of Braunohler and Schaal’s material is fostered by the chemistry that developed from their friendship and extensive professional relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/07/hot_tub_kristen_schaal_last_show_july_30_review.php|title=Live: Kristen Schaal Bids Farewell To Hot Tub|author=Daniel Ralston|date=31 July 2012|work=Sound of the City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/comedian-kurt-braunohler-on-his-new-show-and-partn-81117|title=Comedian Kurt Braunohler on his new show and partnership with Kristen Schaal|work=avclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3162">An '''imprint''' of a [[publisher]] is a [[trade name]] under which it publishes a work. A single [[publishing company]] may have multiple imprints, often using the different names as [[brand]]s to [[marketing|market]] works to various [[demographic]] [[market segment|consumer segments]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Description ==
An imprint of a publisher is a  [[trade name]]—a name that a business uses for trading commercial products or services—under which a work is [[publish]]ed. Imprints typically have a defining character or [[goal|mission]]. In some cases, the diversity results from the [[corporate takeover|takeover]] of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company. In the case of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], imprints have been used to facilitate the venture of a bookseller into publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wetfeet.com/articles/industry-overview-journalism-and-publishing|title=Industry Overview: Journalism and Publishing|publisher=Wet Feet|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels with [[Take-Two Interactive]] credited as "the father of label" in their case the labels are wholly owned incorporated entities with their own publishing and distributing, sales and marketing infrastructure and management teams and their own respective subsidiaries also incorporated (Rockstar North Limited, 2K Vegas, Inc.). This model have influenced rivals including [[Activision Blizzard]], [[Zenimax]], [[Electronic Arts]] from 2008-2018, [[Warner Bros. Interactive]], and [[Koei Tecmo]]. Take-Two have had such model in place since 1997-1998, and is seen as a "a game holding company with autonomous game publishing and development subsidiaries"&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/18/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-im-charged-with-making-hard-decisions/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/03/02/ea-ceo-pledges-freedom-to-take-two-interactives-developers/&lt;/ref&gt;
Independently-owned game publishers like [[Devolver Digital]] also use the word label to describe itself.

== Use ==
A single publishing company may have multiple imprints, with the different imprints often used by the publisher to [[marketing|market]] works to different [[demographic]] [[market segment|consumer segments]]. For example, the objective of [[Viking Press|Viking]]—an imprint of the [[Penguin Group]]—is "[t]o publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than [[ephemeral]] popular interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yodiwan.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/what-is-an-imprint |title=What is an imprint? |work=The Book Publicity Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14881">'''Independent animation''' is [[animation|animated]] short cartoons and feature films produced outside the professional [[Hollywood]] animation industry. A good portion of the work is viewed in animation festivals and private screen rooms along with schools that produce animation through instruction. The significance of independent animation is as important as studio fare.

== History ==

=== Early independent animation ===
The [[history of animation]] is as old as the film industry itself.  Independent animators have produced innovative, often experimental, shorts since the silent era. One of the earliest feature-length animated films was ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'', made in 1926 by [[Lotte Reiniger]], a German artist who made [[silhouette animation]] using intricate cut-out figures and back-lighting.

In America, working independent animators included [[Mary Ellen Bute]], [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]] and [[Oskar Fischinger]] alongside earlier efforts of what would become [[United Productions of America|UPA]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.10/2.10pages/2.10cohen.html The Unnatural History of Independent Animated Films on 16MM-AWN]&lt;/ref&gt;

1959 saw the first independent animated film to win an Oscar with [[John Hubley]]'s ''[[Moonbird]]'' which was also produced by wife and collaborator [[Faith Hubley]] using [[limited animation]] to tell their own personal stories. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/12/25/an-auteurist-history-of-film-independent-animation-1947-60/ MoMA-An Auteurist History of Film: Independent Animation, 1947-60]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Success of independent animation ====
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|Ralph Bakshi tried to establish an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions in the 1970s.]]
In the late 1960s, animator [[Ralph Bakshi]] and producer [[Steve Krantz]] founded Bakshi Productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=54 |chapter=First Gigs }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators.  He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sito |first1=Tom |title=Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson |year=2006 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=0-8131-2407-7 |page=50 |chapter=Suits }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and ''[[Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse]]'', a series of educational shorts paid for by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Television/radio Age |year=1969 |publisher=Television Editorial Corp |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=58; 62–63; 80–81 |chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of [[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]]'s ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;

''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' was the first animated film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with ''Heavy Traffic''. Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since [[Walt Disney]] to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Charles |title=Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation |date=1989 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-394-54684-9 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other independent animators during this time included [[Charles Braverman]], &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.10/2.10pages/2.10cohen.html The Unnatural History of Independent Animated Films on 16MM-AWN]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Deitch]],

[[Marv Newland]], [[Fred Wolf (animator)|Fred Wolf]] and [[Will Vinton]]. The latter two would go on to win Academy Awards for [[Best Animated Short Film]] alongside with the works of the Hubleys and [[Ernest Pintoff]] starting in the late 50's-early 60's. 

Notable award-winning films included Dale Case and Bob Mitchell's ''[[The Further Adventures of Uncle Sam]]'', Ted Petok's ''[[The Crunch Bird]]'', [[Frank Mouris]]'s ''[[Frank Film]]'' and Jimmy Picker's ''[[Sundae in New York]]''.

Animation historians [[John Canemaker]] and [[Michael Sporn]] also made independent animation in New York, both earning Oscar nods for their work (only Canemaker won in 2005). 

Other animators like [[Jeff Scher]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/424965/independent-frames-american-animation-quad-cinema/ The Creativity of Pre-Digital Animation of the 1970s and 80s-Hyperallergic]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Joanna Priestley]], Kathy Rose, [[Robert Swarthe]], Vince Collins, Barrie Nelson, [[Eli Noyes]], Sky David (aka Dennis Pies), Steve Segal, [[Adam Beckett]] and [[George Griffin (animator)|George Griffin]] also made experimental animation during the mid-late 70's through early-mid 80's. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.10/2.10pages/2.10cohen.html The Unnatural History of Independent Animated Films on 16MM-AWN]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, independent animators like [[Sally Cruikshank]] continued to explore independent and [[D.I.Y.]] distribution options, but were still largely met with rejection even though their work is now considered ground breaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/sally-cruikshank-a-career-retrospective-part-one/ ''Sally Cruikshank: A Career Retrospective, Part 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Collections of independent films have been gathered for theatrical viewing, and video release, under such titles as the [[International Tournee of Animation]] (which existed between about 1966 and the late 1990s) and Spike and Mike's ''Classic Festival of Animation'' (1977 to 1990) and [[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]] since 1990. Contemporary independent animators, including [[Steven Subotnick]], [[Paul Fierlinger]], [[Bill Plympton]], [[Don Hertzfeldt]], [[Nina Paley]], [[Suzan Pitt]] and [[PES (director)|PES]] have also made work outside of the studio system.

==== Later independent animation ====

The rise of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential increase in the production of independent animation which included personal independent works by Timothy Hittle &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kqed.org/arts/65589/a_rare_treat_bay_area_animation A Rare Treat: Bay Area Animation-KQED Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Lewis Klahr]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.redcat.org/event/re-animation-evening-lewis-klahr Re-Animation: An Evening with Lewis Klahr-REDCAT]&lt;/ref&gt; and John Schnall &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awn.com/animationworld/death-laughs-among-us-films-john-schnall Death Laughs Among Us: The Films of John Schnall-Animation World Network]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Personal computer]] power increased to the point where it was possible for a single person to produce an animated cartoon on a home computer, using software such as [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and distribute these short films over the [[World Wide Web]]. Independently produced Internet cartoons flourished as the popularity of the Web grew, and a number of strange, often hilarious short cartoons were produced for the Web.

In the late 1990s, an independent animated short film called ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]'' was produced for under $2,000 by two artists, [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]].  This film was widely distributed on the Internet as a pirated cartoon, and its phenomenal popularity gave rise to the popular television [[animated series]] ''[[South Park]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Popular YouTube Series Annoying Orange Moves to TV|url = http://mashable.com/2011/04/15/annoying-orange-tv/|website = Mashable|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Brenna Ehrlich2011-04-15 18:03:34|last = UTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited 1990s bandwidth made streaming difficult, if not impossible. While some animators like [[Spümcø]]'s John K. opted to use [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], it still required a plug-in making it unviewable in many early [[web browsers]]. Other early online animators like [[Wartella|M. Wartella]] opted to use the [[GIF|Animated GIF]] to overcome these limitations and create early web-based animation viewable through all browsers.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/03/cyber/artsatlarge/19artsatlarge.html ''Animator Pursues a Minimal Approach to His Art'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued success for independent animation occurred in the 2000s with animated shorts such as ''[[Making Fiends (web cartoon)|Making Fiends]]''. Both shorts garnered enough support to be turned into full-length [[TV Series]], airing on Nicktoons Network and Big TV, respectively.

By the late mid-2000s, [[YouTube]] and the [[Internet]] and like-minded online video distribution, in addition to independent broadcasting sites that followed, proved to be a dominant form of independently distributed, broadcast, edited, and produced animation TV shows, anime, feature films, music videos, retro animation, commercials, trailers, original online animation content, and web exclusives (which would otherwise not stand a chance of seeing airtime on more normal, seemingly infinitely more expensive forms of mainstream broadcasting on traditional television networks, which still continue to function on a more conservative and old fashioned distribution matrix). ''[[The Annoying Orange]]'', which started off as a series of viral quasi-CGI animated comedy shorts on [[YouTube]], quickly gained a cult following and an excess of 100 million views online. It is an example of an animated web-series to transition between Internet and television distribution successfully, as an animated series on [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Popular YouTube Series Annoying Orange Moves to TV|url = http://mashable.com/2011/04/15/annoying-orange-tv/|website = Mashable|accessdate = 2016-01-02|first = Brenna Ehrlich2011-04-15 18:03:34|last = UTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent animation outside the United States===

====Canada====
{{Further|:Category:National Film Board of Canada animated short films}}
[[File:Norman McLaren drawing on film - 1944.jpg|thumb|Norman McLaren working on a frame of animation.]]
The [[National Film Board of Canada]] began production of [[animation]] when [[Norman McLaren]] joined the organization in 1941. The NFB proved to be an organization that would give Canada a presence in the film world. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized [[experimental filmmaker]]. The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as [[pinscreen animation]], but most of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and many other awards it won were done in traditional cel [[animation]] (with the exceptions of ''The Sand Castle'' and ''Ryan'').

McLaren's Oscar-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' popularized the form of character movement referred to as [[pixilation|pixillation]], a variant of [[stop motion]]. The term [[pixilation]] itself was created by NFB animator [[Grant Munro (filmmaker)|Grant Munro]] in an experimental film of the same name.

Animators including [[Janet Perlman]], [[Richard Condie]], [[Cordell Barker]], [[John Weldon (animator)|John Weldon]], [[Caroline Leaf]], [[Ishu Patel]] and others all worked at NFB.

====The United Kingdom====
The [[British Film Institute|BFI]] funded around thirty pieces of experimental animation between the mid-fifties to mid-nineties (notable examples: The Quay Brothers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BFI and Animation - Screenonline |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1342540/index.html |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major contributor to independent animation in Britain was [[Channel 4]], which gained an international reputation as one of the most adventurous broadcasters of animation featuring works from [[Joanna Quinn]] (''Girls' Night Out''), Paul Barry (''The Sandman''), [[Mark Baker (animator)|Mark Baker]] (''The Village'') and former NFB animator [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]] (''3 Misses''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel 4 and Animation - Screenonline |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1282041/index.html |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0103528/?ref_=ttco_co_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Limelight''''' is a 2011 documentary that charts the rise and fall of [[New York City]] club king [[Peter Gatien]]. Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen Gatien, it was released in special markets throughout the United States and Canada on September 23, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chew Bose|first=Durga|title=Jen Gatien Dives Into the Limelight (Again)|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/film/2011-03-14/jen-gatien-limelight/|publisher=''Interview Magazine''|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
As the owner of legendary New York City hotspots like [[The Limelight]], [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]], [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]], and Club USA, Peter Gatien was considered by many to be the undisputed king of the 1980s New York City club scene. The [[Ontario]] native, whose trademark eye patch made him stand out in a crowd, built and oversaw a chain of nightclub ventures that brought thousands of patrons per night during its peak years. However, after years of legal battles and police pressure spearheaded by Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s drive to crack down on the city's nightlife scene during the mid-1990s, Gatien was deported to [[Canada]], bringing an end to his presence and influence in the city's nightlife scene. The documentary features interviews with numerous people involved in the club's scene, as well as key informants in Gatien's high-profile trial. Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen, and Alfred Spellman, and directed by [[Billy Corben]] (who previously directed the film ''[[Cocaine Cowboys]]''), the film documents the rise and fall of Gatien and his nightclub empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rakontur.com/limelight/|title=Limelight|publisher=Rakontur|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mass media''' is a diversified collection of [[media (communication)|media]] [[technology|technologies]] that reach a large audience via [[mass communication]]. The technologies through which this communication takes place include a variety of outlets.

[[Broadcast media]] transmit information electronically, via such media as [[film]], [[radio]], recorded music, or [[television]]. [[Digital media]] comprises both [[Internet]] and [[mobile web|mobile]] mass communication. [[Internet]] media comprise such services as [[email]], [[social media]] sites, [[website]]s, and Internet-based radio and television. Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, or distributing [[QR Code]]s in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. '''Outdoor media''' transmit information via such media as [[Augmented Reality|AR advertising]]; [[billboard]]s; [[blimp]]s; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or [[skywriting]].&lt;ref name="Mass Media"/&gt;  '''Print media''' transmit information via physical objects, such as [[book]]s, [[comics]], [[magazine]]s, [[newspaper]]s, or [[pamphlet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Riesman ''et al.'' (1950) ch. 2 p. 50{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; Event organizing and [[public speaking]] can also be considered forms of mass media.&lt;ref name="buzzle" /&gt;

The organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arguing for a general framework for mass media scholarship"/&gt;{{qn|date=September 2012}}

== Issues with definition ==

In the late 20th century, mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries: books, the Internet, magazines, movies, newspapers, radio, recordings, and television.  The explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries made prominent the question: what forms of media should be classified as "mass media"?  For example, it is controversial whether to include [[cell phones]], [[computer games]] (such as [[MMORPG]]s), and [[video games]] in the definition.  In the 2000s, a classification called the "[[seven mass media]]" became popular.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In order of introduction, they are:

# [[Printing|Print]] ([[book]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, etc.) from the late 15th century
# [[Sound recording and reproduction|Recordings]] ([[gramophone record]]s, [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[Stereo-Pak|cartridges]], [[CD]]s, and [[DVD]]s) from the late 19th century
# [[Film|Cinema]] from about 1900
# [[Radio broadcasting|Radio]] from about 1910
# [[Television]] from about 1950
# [[Internet]] from about 1990
# [[Mobile phone]]s from about 2000

Each mass medium has its own content types, creative artists, technicians, and business models.  For example, the Internet includes [[blog]]s, [[podcasts]], [[web site]]s, and various other technologies built atop the general distribution network.  The sixth and seventh media, Internet and mobile phones, are often referred to collectively as [[digital media]]; and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as [[broadcast media]].  Some argue that [[video games]] have developed into a distinct mass form of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541164 |title=All the world's a game |journal=The Economist |date=2011-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a telephone is a two-way communication device, mass media communicates to a large group. In addition, the telephone has transformed into a cell phone which is equipped with [[Internet]] access. A question arises whether this makes cell phones a mass medium or simply a device used to access a mass medium (the Internet). There is currently a system by which marketers and advertisers are able to tap into satellites, and broadcast commercials and advertisements directly to cell phones, unsolicited by the phone's user.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} This transmission of mass advertising to millions of people is another form of mass communication.

Video games may also be evolving into a mass medium. Video games (for example massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such as ''[[RuneScape]]'') provide a common gaming experience to millions of users across the globe and convey the same messages and ideologies to all their users. Users sometimes share the experience with one another by playing online. Excluding the Internet however,  it is questionable whether players of video games are sharing a common experience when they play the game individually. It is possible to discuss in great detail the events of a video game with a friend one has never played with, because the experience is identical to each. The question, then, is whether this is a form of mass communication.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Characteristics ===

Five characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] of [[Cambridge University]]:&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iXHzjIwQae4C |title=The Media and Modernity|pages=26–28, 74|isbn= 978-0804726795 |year= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[C]omprises both technical and institutional methods of production and distribution" – This is evident throughout the history of mass media, from print to the Internet, each suitable for commercial utility
* Involves the "[[commodification]] of symbolic forms" – as the production of materials relies on its ability to manufacture and sell large quantities of the work; as radio stations rely on their time sold to advertisements, so too newspapers rely on their space for the same reasons
* "[S]eparate contexts between the production and reception of information"
* Its "reach to those 'far removed' in time and space, in comparison to the producers"
* "[I]nformation distribution" – a "one to many" form of communication, whereby products are mass-produced and disseminated to a great quantity of audiences

=== Mass vs. mainstream and alternative ===

The term "mass media" is sometimes erroneously used as a synonym for "'''[[mainstream media]]'''". Mainstream media are distinguished from [[alternative media]] by their content and point of view.  '''Alternative media''' are also "mass media" outlets in the sense that they use technology capable of reaching many people, even if the audience is often smaller than the mainstream.

In common usage, the term "mass" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;

=== Mass vs. local and speciality ===

Mass media are distinguished from '''local media''' by the notion that whilst mass media aims to reach a very large market, such as the entire population of a country, local media broadcasts to a much smaller population and area, and generally focuses on regional news rather than global events. A third type of media, '''speciality media''', provide for specific demographics, such as [[specialty channel]]s on TV ([[sports channel]]s, porn channels, etc.). These definitions are not set in stone, and it is possible for a media outlet to be promoted in status from a local media outlet to a global media outlet. Some local media, which take an interest in state or provincial news, can rise to prominence because of their investigative journalism, and to the local region's preference of updates in national politics rather than regional news. ''[[The Guardian]]'', formerly known as the ''Manchester Guardian'', is an example of one such media outlet; once a regional daily newspaper, ''The Guardian'' is currently a nationally respected paper.&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

== Forms of mass media ==

=== Broadcast ===
[[File:Crystal radio advertisement.png|thumb|A family listening to a [[crystal radio]] in the 1920s.]]
{{Main|Radio broadcasting|Television}}
The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]]. With all technological endeavours a number of technical terms and slang have developed. Please see the [[list of broadcasting terms]] for a glossary of terms used.

[[Radio]] and [[television]] programs are distributed over frequency bands that in the United States are highly regulated. Such regulation includes determination of the width of the bands, range, licensing, types of receivers and transmitters used, and acceptable content.

[[Cable television]] programs are often broadcast simultaneously with radio and television programs, but have a more limited audience. By coding signals and requiring a [[cable converter box]] at individual recipients' locations, cable also enables [[subscription]]-based channels and [[pay-per-view]] services.

A broadcasting [[organisation]] may broadcast several programs simultaneously, through several channels ([[frequencies]]), for example [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two|Two]]. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day, such as the [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Adult Swim]]. [[Digital radio]] and [[digital television]] may also transmit [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] programming, with several channels [[data compression|compressed]] into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]].

When broadcasting is done via the Internet the term [[webcasting]] is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce [[podcast]]ing. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. [[Adam Curry]] and his associates, the ''[[Podshow]]'', are principal proponents of podcasting.

=== Film ===
{{Main|Film}}
The term ''''film'''' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]), historically the primary [[recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.  Many other terms for film exist, such as ''motion pictures'' (or just ''pictures'' and "picture"), ''the silver screen'', ''photoplays'', ''the cinema'', ''picture shows'', ''flicks'', and most common, ''movies''.

Films are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] people and objects with [[camera]]s, or by creating them using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, an illusion of motion is created.  Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed.  Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion: a psychological effect identified as [[beta movement]].

Film is considered by many{{who|date=March 2015}} to be an important [[art]] form; films entertain, educate, enlighten, and inspire audiences. Any film can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that translate the film message. Films are also artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.{{who|date=March 2015}}

=== Video games ===

A [[video game]] is a [[computer]]-controlled game in which a video display, such as a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[television]], is the primary feedback device. The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text (and which can, therefore, theoretically be played on a [[teletypewriter]]) or which use other methods, such as sound or vibration, as their primary feedback device, but there are very few new games in these categories.{{who|date=March 2015}} There always must also be some sort of [[input device]], usually in the form of [[button (control)|button/joystick]] combinations (on arcade games), a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]]/[[trackball]] combination (computer games), a [[Game controller|controller]] ([[Video game console|console]] games), or a combination of any of the above. Also, more esoteric devices have been used for input, e.g., the player's motion. Usually there are rules and goals, but in more open-ended games the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of the virtual universe.

In common usage, an "[[arcade game]]" refers to a game designed to be played in an establishment in which patrons pay to play on a per-use basis. A "computer game" or "[[personal computer game|PC game]]" refers to a game that is played on a [[personal computer]]. A "[[Console game]]" refers to one that is played on a device specifically designed for the use of such, while interfacing with a standard [[television]] set. A "video game" (or "videogame") has evolved into a catchall phrase that encompasses the aforementioned along with any game made for any other device, including, but not limited to, advanced [[calculator]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], etc.

=== Audio recording and reproduction ===

[[Sound recording and reproduction]] is the [[electric]]al or mechanical re-creation or amplification of [[sound]], often as [[music]]. This involves the use of [[audio equipment]] such as microphones, recording devices, and loudspeakers. From early beginnings with the invention of the [[phonograph]] using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the [[Gramophone record|78 record]], the [[wire recorder|magnetic wire recorder]] followed by the [[tape recorder]], the vinyl [[Gramophone record|LP record]]. The invention of the [[compact cassette]] in the 1960s, followed by Sony's [[Walkman]], gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of [[digital recording]] and the [[compact disc]] in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality. The most recent developments have been in [[digital audio player]]s.

An album is a collection of related audio recordings, released together to the public, usually commercially.

The term [[album|record album]] originated from the fact that 78 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] [[Phonograph]] [[Gramophone record|disc records]] were kept together in a book resembling a photo album. The first collection of records to be called an "album" was [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'', release in April 1909 as a four-disc set by [[Odeon records]].&lt;ref name="sandiego"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronomedia"/&gt; It retailed for 16 [[shillings]] – about [[Pound sterling|£]]15 in modern currency.

A [[music video]] (also promo) is a [[short film]] or [[video]] that accompanies a complete piece of music, most commonly a [[song]]. Modern music videos were primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the origins of music videos go back much further, they came into their own in the 1980s, when [[Music Television]]'s format was based on them. In the 1980s, the term "rock video" was often used to describe this form of entertainment, although the term has fallen into disuse.

Music videos can accommodate all styles of filmmaking, including [[animation]], [[live action]] films, [[documentary film|documentaries]], and non-narrative, [[abstract film]].

=== Internet ===
{{see also|Digital media}}

The [[Internet]] (also known simply as "the Net" or less precisely as "the Web") is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as "a network of networks". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected [[computer network]]s that transmit [[data (computing)|data]] by [[packet switching]] using the standard [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and governmental networks, which together carry various [[information]] and services, such as [[email]], [[online chat]], [[Computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

Contrary to some common usage, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous: the Internet is the system of interconnected ''computer networks'', linked by [[copper]] wires, [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cables, [[wireless]] connections etc.; the Web is the contents, or the interconnected ''documents'', linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, [[file sharing]] and others described below.

Toward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Anyone with a [[web site]] has the potential to address a global audience, although serving to high levels of [[web traffic]] is still relatively expensive. It is possible that the rise of [[peer-to-peer]] technologies may have begun the process of making the cost of bandwidth manageable.  Although a vast amount of information, imagery, and commentary (i.e. "content") has been made available, it is often difficult to determine the authenticity and reliability of information contained in web pages (in many cases, self-published). The invention of the Internet has also allowed breaking news stories to reach around the globe within minutes.  This rapid growth of instantaneous, decentralized communication is often deemed likely to change mass media and its relationship to society.

"Cross-media" means the idea of distributing the same message through different media channels. A similar idea is expressed in the news industry as "convergence". Many authors understand cross-media publishing to be the ability to publish in both [[printing|print]] and on the web without manual conversion effort. An increasing number of [[wireless]] devices with mutually incompatible data and screen formats make it even more difficult to achieve the objective "create once, publish many".

The Internet is quickly becoming the center of mass media. Everything is becoming accessible via the internet. Rather than picking up a newspaper, or watching the 10 o'clock news, people can log onto the internet to get the news they want, when they want it. For example, many workers listen to the radio through the Internet while sitting at their desk.

Even the [[education system]] relies on the Internet. Teachers can contact the entire class by sending one e-mail. They may have web pages on which students can get another copy of the class outline or assignments. Some classes have class blogs in which students are required to post weekly, with students graded on their contributions.

==== Blogs (web logs) ====

[[Blogging]], too, has become a pervasive form of media.  A [[blog]] is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 blog), audio (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. [[Microblogging]] is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.

==== RSS feeds ====

[[RSS]] is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like [[Wired News|Wired]], news-oriented community sites like [[Slashdot]], and personal blogs. It is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines, and podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a "feed" or "web feed" or "channel") contains either a summary of content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner that can be piped into special programs or filtered displays.

==== Podcast ====
{{Main|Podcast}}

A [[podcast]] is a series of digital-media files which are distributed over the Internet using syndication feeds for playback on portable media players and computers. The term podcast, like broadcast, can refer either to the series of content itself or to the method by which it is syndicated; the latter is also called podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.

==== Mobile ====
{{Main|Mobile media}}

[[Mobile phone]]s were introduced in [[Japan]] in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, [[tablet computer|tablets]] and other portable devices, and today the total value of media consumed on mobile vastly exceeds that of internet content, and was worth over 31 billion dollars in 2007 (source Informa). The mobile media content includes over 8 billion dollars worth of mobile music (ringing tones, ringback tones, truetones, MP3 files, karaoke, music videos, music streaming services etc.); over 5 billion dollars worth of mobile gaming; and various news, entertainment and advertising services. In Japan mobile phone books are so popular that five of the ten best-selling printed books were originally released as mobile phone books.

Similar to the internet, mobile is also an [[interactive media]], but has far wider reach, with 3.3 billion mobile phone users at the end of 2007 to 1.3 billion internet users (source ITU). Like email on the internet, the top application on mobile is also a personal messaging service, but SMS text messaging is used by over 2.4 billion people. Practically all internet services and applications exist or have similar cousins on mobile, from search to multiplayer games to virtual worlds to blogs. Mobile has several unique benefits which many mobile media pundits claim make mobile a more powerful media than either TV or the internet, starting with mobile being permanently carried and always connected. Mobile has the best audience accuracy and is the only mass media with a built-in payment channel available to every user without any credit cards or PayPal accounts or even an age limit. Mobile is often called the [[Seven mass media|7th Mass Medium]] and either the fourth screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens) or the third screen (counting only TV and PC).

=== Print media ===
{{Main|Newspaper|Magazine}}
{{see also|Publishing#Industry sub-divisions|Printing}}

==== Magazine ====
A [[magazine]] is a periodical [[publication]] containing a variety of articles, generally financed by [[advertising]] or purchase by readers.

Magazines are typically published [[week]]ly, [[biweekly]], [[month]]ly, [[bimonthly]] or [[quarterly]], with a [[periodical cover date|date on the cover]] that is in advance of the date it is actually published.  They are often printed in color on [[coated paper]], and are bound with a [[bookbinding|soft cover]].

Magazines fall into two broad categories: consumer magazines and business magazines.  In practice, magazines are a subset of [[:Category:Periodicals|periodicals]], distinct from those periodicals produced by scientific, artistic, academic or special interest publishers which are subscription-only, more expensive, narrowly limited in circulation, and often have little or no advertising.

Magazines can be classified as:
* General interest magazines (e.g. ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', ''[[India Today]]'', ''[[The Week]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' etc.)
* Special interest magazines (women's, sports, business, [[scuba diving]], etc.)

==== Newspaper ====
A [[newspaper]] is a [[publication]] containing news and information and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called [[newsprint]]. It may be general or special interest, most often published daily or weekly. The most important function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|last=Pavlik, John|first=McIntosh, Shawn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0190271510|location=New York|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local newspapers inform local communities and include advertisements from local businesses and services, while national newspapers tend to focus on a theme, which can be exampled with "The Wall Street Journal" as they offer news on finance and business related-topics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first printed newspaper was published in 1605, and the form has thrived even in the face of competition from technologies such as radio and television. Recent developments on the Internet are posing major threats to its business model, however. Paid circulation is declining in most countries, and advertising revenue, which makes up the bulk of a newspaper's income, is shifting from print to online; some commentators, nevertheless, point out that historically new media such as radio and television did not entirely supplant existing.

The internet has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 201/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B0BC365_3_169&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Trends Report]], between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]], where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Most notably, between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outdoor media ===

Outdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards placed inside and outside commercial buildings/objects like shops/buses, flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes), blimps, skywriting, AR Advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums. Tobacco and alcohol manufacturers used billboards and other outdoor media extensively. However, in 1998, the Master Settlement Agreement between the US and the tobacco industries prohibited the billboard advertising of cigarettes. In a 1994 Chicago-based study, Diana Hackbarth and her colleagues revealed how tobacco- and alcohol-based billboards were concentrated in poor neighbourhoods. In other urban centers, alcohol and tobacco billboards were much more concentrated in African-American neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Mass Media"/&gt;

== Purposes ==
[[File:911-Panel.JPG|thumb|A panel in the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], shows the September 12 headlines in America and around the world.]]

Mass media encompasses much more than just news, although it is sometimes misunderstood in this way.  It can be used for various purposes:
* [[Advocacy]], both for business and social concerns. This can include [[advertising]], [[marketing]], [[propaganda]], [[public relations]], and [[politics|political]] communication.
* [[Entertainment]], traditionally through performances of [[acting]], [[music]], and [[TV show]]s along with light reading; since the late 20th century also through [[video and computer games]].
* [[Public service announcement]]s and emergency alerts (that can be used as political device to communicate propaganda to the public).&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

== Professions involving mass media ==

=== Journalism ===

[[Journalism]] is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting [[information]] regarding [[News|current events]], [[Fads and trends|trends]], issues and [[people]]. Those who practice journalism are known as [[journalist]]s.

[[News]]-oriented journalism is sometimes described as the "first rough draft of history" (attributed to [[Phil Graham]]), because journalists often record important events, producing news articles on short deadlines. While under pressure to be first with their stories, [[news media]] organizations usually [[editing|edit]] and [[proofreading|proofread]] their reports prior to publication, adhering to each organization's standards of accuracy, quality and style. Many news organizations claim proud traditions of holding government officials and institutions accountable to the public, while media critics have raised questions about holding the press itself accountable to the standards of [[Journalism#Professional journalism|professional journalism]].

=== Public relations ===

[[Public relations]] is the art and science of managing communication between an organization and its key publics to build, manage and sustain its positive image. Examples include:
* [[Corporation]]s use marketing public relations to convey information about the products they manufacture or services they provide to potential customers to support their direct sales efforts.  Typically, they support sales in the short and long term, establishing and burnishing the corporation's branding for a strong, ongoing market.
* Corporations also use public relations as a vehicle to reach legislators and other politicians, seeking favorable tax, regulatory, and other treatment, and they may use public relations to portray themselves as enlightened employers, in support of human-resources recruiting programs.
* [[Non-profit organization|Nonprofit organizations]], including schools and universities, hospitals, and human and social service agencies, use public relations in support of awareness programs, fund-raising programs, staff recruiting, and to increase patronage of their services.
* Politicians use public relations to attract votes and raise money, and when successful at the ballot box, to promote and defend their service in office, with an eye to the next election or, at career’s end, to their legacy.

=== Publishing ===

[[Publishing]] is the industry concerned with the production of [[literature]] or [[information]] – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers.

Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as [[book]]s and [[newspaper]]s. With the advent of digital information systems and the [[Internet]], the scope of publishing has expanded to include [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and the like.

As a [[business]], publishing includes the development, [[marketing]], [[Mass production|production]], and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of newspapers, magazines, books, [[literary work]]s, [[musical composition|musical works]], [[software]], other works dealing with information.

Publication is also important as a [[law|legal concept]]; (1) as the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or enter bankruptcy, and; (2) as the essential precondition of being able to claim [[defamation]]; that is, the alleged [[libel]] must have been published.

==== Software publishing ====

A [[software publisher]] is a [[publishing]] [[company (law)|company]] in the [[software industry]] between the [[software developer|developer]] and the [[distribution (business)|distributor]]. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of [[shareware]]).

Software publishers often license software from developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.

Developers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets, or to avoid focussing on marketing. Or publishers may use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.

=== Internet Based Professions ===
A [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] is anyone who has made their fame from creating and promoting videos on the public video-sharing site, [[YouTube]]. Many YouTube celebrities have made a profession from their site through sponsorships, advertisements, product placement, and network support.

== History ==
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Early wooden printing press, depicted in 1520.]]
The history of mass media can be traced back to the days when dramas were performed in various ancient cultures. This was the first time when a form of media was "broadcast" to a wider audience. The first dated printed book known is the "[[Diamond Sutra]]", printed in China in 868&amp;nbsp;AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass-medium was probably European [[popular prints]] from about 1400.  Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term "mass media" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation.  He printed the first book, a Latin Bible, on a [[printing press]] with [[movable type]] in 1453. The invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication, by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible.&lt;ref name="Radical mass media criticism: a cultural genealogy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ramey-2007-1-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex, love &amp; romance in the mass media: analysis &amp; criticism of unrealistic portrayals &amp; their influence"/&gt; The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass-medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt; but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass-audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as [[The Times]], and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of library and information science, Volume 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A companion to media studies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mass media &amp; society"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corey Ross, ''Mass Communications, Society, and Politics from the Empire to the Third Reich'' (Oxford University Press 2010) on Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the media" began to be used in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet"/&gt; The notion of "mass media" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. In recent times, the Internet become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. One can do many activities at the same time, such as playing games, listening to music, and social networking, irrespective of location. Whilst other forms of mass media are restricted in the type of information they can offer, the internet comprises a large percentage of the sum of human knowledge through such things as Google Books. Modern day mass media includes the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.&lt;ref name="History of Mass Media"/&gt;

During the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by [[technology]], including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as [[printing]], record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. [[Radio]] and [[television]] allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. An example of Riel and Neil's theory. [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were to be made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the [[Constituency|electorate]] about issues regarding government and corporate entities (see [[Media influence]]). Some consider the [[concentration of media ownership]] to be a threat to democracy.&lt;ref name="incorporated"/&gt;

=== Mergers and Acquisitions ===
Between 1985 and 2018 about 76,720 deals have been announced in the Media industry. This sums up to an overall value of around 5,634 bil USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries – Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three major waves of M&amp;A in the Mass Media Sector (2000, 2007 and 2015), while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals. The U.S. is the most prominent country in Media M&amp;A with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquiror from the United States.

The largest deal in history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc for 164,746.86 mil USD.

== Influence and sociology ==
{{main|influence of mass media}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
'''Limited-effects theory''', originally tested in the 1940s and 1950s, considers that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. '''Class-dominant theory''' argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. '''Culturalist theory''', which was developed in the 1980s and 1990s, combines the other two theories and claims that people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. This theory states that audience members play an active, rather than passive role in relation to mass media.

{{Globalize|section|date=March 2015}}
In an article entitled ''Mass Media Influence on Society'', rayuso {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} argues that the media ''in the US'' is dominated by five major companies (Time Warner, VIACOM, Vivendi Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp) which own 95% of all mass media including theme parks, movie studios, television and radio broadcast networks and programing, video news, sports entertainment, telecommunications, wireless phones, video games software, electronic media and music companies. Whilst historically, there was more diversity in companies, they have recently merged to form an elite which have the power to shape the opinion and beliefs of people. People buy after seeing thousands of advertisements by various companies in TV, newspapers or magazines, which are able to affect their purchasing decisions. The definition of what is acceptable by society is dictated by the media. This power can be used for good, for example encouraging children to play sport. However, it can also be used for bad, for example children being influenced by cigars smoked by film stars, their exposure to sex images, their exposure to images of violence and their exposure to junk food ads. The documentary ''[[Super Size Me]]'' describes how companies like McDonald's have been sued in the past, the plaintiffs claiming that it was the fault of their liminal and subliminal advertising that "forced" them to purchase the product. The Barbie and Ken dolls of the 1950s are sometimes cited as the main cause for the obsession in modern-day society for women to be skinny and men to be buff. After the attacks of 9/11, the media gave extensive coverage of the event and exposed Osama Bin Laden's guilt for the attack, information they were told by the authorities. This shaped the public opinion to support the war on terrorism, and later, the war on Iraq. A main concern is that due to this immense power of the mass media (being able to drive the public opinion), media receiving inaccurate information could cause the public opinion to support the wrong cause.

In his book The Commercialization of American Culture, Matthew P. McAllister says that "a well-developed media system, informing and teaching its citizens, helps democracy move toward its ideal state."&lt;ref name="enotes"/&gt;

In 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified 3 main effects or functions of mass media:

:#'''The Knowledge Gap:''' The mass media influences knowledge gaps due to factors including "the extent to which the content is appealing, the degree to which information channels are accessible and desirable, and the amount of social conflict and diversity there is in a community".
:#'''Agenda Setting:''' People are influence in how they think about issues due to the selective nature of what media choose for public consumption. After publicly disclosing that he had prostate cancer prior to the 2000 New York senatorial election, Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York City (aided by the media) sparked a huge priority elevation of the cancer in people's consciousness. This was because news media began to report on the risks of prostate cancer, which in turn prompted a greater public awareness about the disease and the need for screening. This ability for the media to be able to change how the public thinks and behaves has occurred on other occasions. In mid-1970s when Betty Ford and Happy Rockefeller, wives of the then-President and then-Vice President respectively, were both diagnosed with breast cancer. J. J. Davis states that "when risks are highlighted in the media, particularly in great detail, the extent of agenda setting is likely to be based on the degree to which a public sense of outrage and threat is provoked". When wanting to set an agenda, framing can be invaluably useful to a mass media organisation. Framing involves "taking a leadership role in the organisation of public discourse about an issue". The media is influenced by the desire for balance in coverage, and the resulting pressures can come from groups with particular political action and advocacy positions. Finnegan and Viswanath say, "groups, institutions, and advocates compete to identify problems, to move them onto the public agenda, and to define the issues symbolically" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;324).
:#'''Cultivation of Perceptions:''' The extent to which media exposure shapes audience perceptions over time is known as cultivation. Television is a common experience, especially in places like the United States, to the point where it can be described as a "homogenising agent" (S. W. Littlejohn). However, instead of being merely a result of the TV, the effect is often based on socioeconomic factors. Having a prolonged exposure to TV or movie violence might affect a viewer to the extent where they actively think community violence is a problem, or alternatively find it justifiable. The resulting belief is likely to be different depending of where people live however.&lt;ref name="enotes" /&gt;

Since the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population, these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control.&lt;ref name="Lorimer94p26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vipond2000p88"/&gt; Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the country itself "belongs to the person who controls communications."&lt;ref name="Eco67"/&gt;

Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information.&lt;ref name="Lorimer94p26"/&gt; They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values, and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation.&lt;ref name="Vipond2000p88"/&gt; Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general strikes.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;Dan Braha. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048596 "Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction"], PLoS ONE 7(10) (2012): e48596. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0048596}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.&lt;ref name="civil"/&gt;

Mass media sources, through theories like framing and agenda-setting, can affect the scope of a story as particular facts and information are highlighted ([[Media influence]]). This can directly correlate with how individuals may perceive certain groups of people, as the only media coverage a person receives can be very limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation; stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective to target a specific demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Al-Jazeera English and global news networks: Clash of civilizations or cross-cultural dialogue?|last = Powers, S., el-Nawawy, M.|date = 2009|journal = Media, War &amp; Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example ====
According to Stephen Balkaran, an Instructor of Political Science and African American Studies at Central Connecticut State University, mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African-Americans. The media focus on African-American in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence, and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African-Americans. African-Americans have been subjected to oppression and discrimination for the past few hundred years. According to Stephen Balkaran in his article "Mass Media and Racism": "The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African-Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens". This has resulted in an uncertainty among white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African-Americans really is. Despite the resulting [[racial segregation|racial divide]], the fact that these people are undeniably American has "raised doubts about the white man's value system". This means that there is a somewhat "troubling suspicion" among some Americans that their white America is tainted by the black influence.&lt;ref name="Mass Media and Racism" /&gt; Mass media as well as [[propaganda]] tend to reinforce or introduce [[stereotype]]s to the general public.

== Ethical issues and criticism ==

Lack of local or specific topical focus is a common criticism of mass media.  A mass [[news media]] outlet is often forced to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it has to skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers. An example given by the website WiseGeek is that "the residents of a community might view their fight against development as critical, but the story would only attract the attention of the mass media if the fight became controversial or if precedents of some form were set".&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

The term "mass" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of "mass culture" and [[mass society]] which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them.&lt;ref name="thompson" /&gt;  However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.&lt;ref name="thompson" /&gt;

Whilst some{{who|date=January 2012}} refer to the mass media as "opiate of the masses", others{{who|date=January 2012}} argue that is a vital aspect of human societies. By understanding mass media, one is then able to analyse and find a deeper understanding of one's population and culture. This valuable and powerful ability is one reason why the field of [[media studies]] is popular. As WiseGeek says, "watching, reading, and interacting with a nation's mass media can provide clues into how people think, especially if a diverse assortment of mass media sources are perused".&lt;ref name="wisegeek" /&gt;

Since the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a [[advanced capitalism|high level of industrialization]], the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.&lt;ref name="Eco67"/&gt;

Contemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of [[concentration of media ownership]], with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms.&lt;ref name="The SAGE Handbook of Media Studies"/&gt;

'''Criticism'''

When the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=G.|title=2015 Henry Mayer Lecture: critical media studies and the re-invention of the media|journal=Media International Australia|language=en|volume=161|issue=1|pages=101–08|doi=10.1177/1329878x16659549|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, there are critiques that mass media no longer exists, or at least that it doesn't exist in the same form as it once did. This original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to "news" something that is harder to do in a society of social media.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/87571696&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production.&lt;ref&gt;file:///Users/jessicafrankson/Downloads/Bennett--The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20News%20and%20the%20End%20of%20a%20Journalism%20Era%20(1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett's critique of 21st Century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or wouldn't be printed.

Social Media is a large contributor to the change from mass media to a new paradigm because through social media what is mass communication and what is interpersonal communication is confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zdRzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=mass+media+re+invented#v=onepage&amp;q=mass%20media%20re%20invented&amp;f=false|title=Re-Inventing the Media|last=Turner|first=Graeme|date=2015-08-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317381471|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpersonal/niche communication is an exchange of information and information in a specific genre. In this form of communication, smaller groups of people are consuming news/information/opinions. In contrast, mass media in its original form is not restricted by genre and it is being consumed by the masses.

'''''Metro''''' ({{lang-ru|Метро}}) is a franchise consisting of novels and video games, which began with the release of [[Dmitry Glukhovsky]]'s ''[[Metro 2033]]'' novel in 2005. Although it began in Russia, the project enjoys plenty of popularity in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and Germany as well.

[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] studio [[4A Games]] had developed three titles set in the universe: ''[[Metro 2033 (video game)|Metro 2033]]'' (2010), ''[[Metro: Last Light]]'' (2013) and the upcoming ''[[Metro: Exodus]]'' (2019).

All of the ''Metro'' stories share the same setting – the fictional world of Glukhovsky's original novel. Although it described only his own vision of a [[post-apocalyptic]] Moscow, the books of the extended universe take place in a wide variety of different areas. Among these are: [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Leningrad Oblast]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Tver Oblast]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Kola Peninsula]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Samara]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]], and the [[Kaliningrad oblast]]. Some of the books in the series are set in other locations outside of Russia, such as [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], and [[Antarctica]].

"'''Mickey'''" is a 1981 song recorded by American singer and choreographer [[Toni Basil]] on her debut album ''[[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|Word of Mouth]]''. Written by [[Mike Chapman]] and [[Nicky Chinn]] as "'''Kitty'''", it was first recorded by UK music group [[Racey]] during 1979 appearing on their debut album ''Smash and Grab''. Toni Basil changed the name from Kitty to Mickey to make the song about a man.

==Release==
Toni Basil's version of the song was initially issued as a single in the UK in May 1981, but did not chart at that time. Reissued in January 1982, "Mickey" quickly became a substantial UK hit, reaching number 2. It was issued in Australia by April, where over the Northern summer (Southern winter) it rose to number 1.

Finally issued in North America in August 1982, "Mickey" became a number 1 hit in the US and Canada in late 1982, a year and a half after its original release.

==Background==
The original Racey song did not include the famous "Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind" chant, which Basil added.

For years, it had been rumored that the name was changed to Mickey because Basil had a crush on [[The Monkees|Monkees]]' drummer and lead vocalist [[Micky Dolenz]] after meeting him on the set of their movie ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'' for which she was the choreographer; however, this claim has been denied by Basil, who said she didn't know Dolenz that well.&lt;ref&gt; name="Vulture"&gt;{{cite web|first= Adrienne |last= Day |url= http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |title= Vulture Investigates: Is Toni Basil's 'Mickey' Really About...Well, You Know? |publisher= [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] |date= 17 August 2012 |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different [[music video]]s for the song were recorded, one featuring Basil with a backing band, and another featuring costuming and choreography inspired by [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] dance routines. Filmed in 1981, the Cheerleader video is considered the very first choreographed dance video, and the opening stunt, where a cheerleader jumps through the center of a human pyramid, is now illegal in competition.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] commented on the obscene content of the lyric "So come on and give it to me / Any way you can / Any way you want to do it / I'll take it like a man". Christgau wrote in a review at the time that Basil "was the only woman ever to offer to [[anal sex|take it up the ass]] on Top 40 radio." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Adrienne |last= Day |title= Vulture Investigates: Is Toni Basil's 'Mickey' Really About...Well, You Know? |website= [[Vulture.com]] |date= August 17, 2012 |accessdate= September 18, 2018 |url= http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180917093627/http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/vulture-investigates-what-is-toni-basils-mickey-really-about.html |archivedate= September 17, 2018 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single scored number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for one week and number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was Basil's only Top 40 success.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Huey |title= Toni Basil – Artist Biography |publisher= [[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/toni-basil-mn0000517797/biography |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named #5 on VH1's 100 Greatest [[one-hit wonder|One Hit Wonder]]s of All Time, #16 on ''20 to 1'''s Top 20 One Hit Wonders Countdown and #57 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of the '80s''.

'''Multimedia translation''', also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of [[Multimodality|multimodal]] and [[multimedia]]l texts into another language and/or culture.&lt;ref&gt;González, Luis Pérez. "Audiovisual Translation", in [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] and Gabriela Saldanha (eds.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies'', London, 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.

==Application==
Multimedia translation can be applied to  various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.

Audiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of [[Social semiotics|semiotic]] resources or ‘modes’.&lt;ref&gt;Baldry, Anthony and Paul J. Thibault. ''Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis'', London &amp; Oakville: Equinox, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  When various modes, such as [[language]], [[image]], [[music]], [[colour]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Multimedia'' [Interview]. Hightech (August 1991): 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Christopher J.|year=2003|title=Multimodal Transcription in the Analysis, Translation and Subtitling of Italian Films|journal=The Translator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1080/13556509.2003.10799153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Academic study of multimedia translation==
The translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of [[translation studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Cintas, Jorge. ''New Trends in Audiovisual Translation''. Bristol/Buffalo/Toronto: Multilingual Matters. 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84769-154-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlović|first=Nataša|year=2004|title=Addressing Power and Solidarity in TV Subtitling|journal=Across Languages and Cultures|volume=5|issue=2|pages=211–232|doi=10.1556/Acr.5.2004.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Modes of translation==
This kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.

=== Dubbing ===
[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]], sometimes known as "lip-synchrony", involves both the translation and its [[Synchronization|synchronisation]] as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isabel|first=Ana|last2=Bartolomé|first2=Hernández|last3=Cabrera|first3=Gustavo Mendiluce|year=2005|title=New Trends in Audiovisual Translation: The Latest Challenging Modes|url=http://www.miscelaneajournal.net/images/stories/articulos/vol31/bartolome31.pdf.|journal=Miscelánea|volume=31|pages=89–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the "timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue" as closely as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audiovisual Translation Theories, Methods And Issues|last=Pérez-Gonzalez|first=Luis|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Subtitling ===
The most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys "a target language version of the source speech."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open [[Closed captioning|captions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Voice over ===
[[Voice-over|Voice over]] involves the original [[soundtrack]] and the translation being broadcast simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voice over is considered a "cheap alternative to dubbing" so it is the first choice for translating films in former [[Communist state]]s and some countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Interpreting ===
[[Language interpretation|Interpreting]] is "the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode is usually used in live [[interview]]s and news broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Surtitling ===
[[Surtitles|Surtitling]] is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Becoming more frequent in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] and [[Opera house|operahouses]], the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Free commentary ===
Free commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in [[Children's television series|children's television shows]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], humorous videos, [[Parody|film parodies]] and [[corporate video]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partial dubbing ===
Also known as "half-dubbing" or "concise synchronisation", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Narration ===
[[Narration]] consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It can be pre-recorded or performed live.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Simultaneous translation ===
Also known as "sight translation", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is different from interpretation in that "it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Live subtitling ===
Also known as "real-time subtitling", it differs from regular subtitling in that the [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A "respeaker" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and "respeaks" it into a speech recognition software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Subtitling for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH) ===
[[Subtitle (captioning)#SDH|SDH]] is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to "see" the sound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the "growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements" for [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling companies.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Audio description (AD) ===
[[Audio description|AD]] is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reader, known as an "audio describer", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation has become important in "ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Animation ===
Animation involves translation as well as script writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Double version ===
Double versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Remake ===
Remakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Teaching==
Since the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences|Winterthur]]).

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''narrative environment''' is a space, whether physical or [[Virtuality|virtual]], in which stories can unfold.  A virtual [[narrative]] environment might be the narrative framework in which game play can proceed. A physical narrative environment might be an exhibition area within a museum, or a foyer of a retail space, or the public spaces around a building - anywhere in short where stories can be told in space. It is also a term coined by the [[Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design]] program in Narrative Whitby{{what?|date=January 2014}}, where the first Narrative Environment course was introduced in 2003. It is a full-time, 2 year Masters level course leading to an MA degree in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments.

'''Out-of-Home Entertainment''' (also '''OOHE''' or '''OHE''') is a term coined by the amusement industry to collectively refer to experiences at regional attractions like theme parks and waterparks with their thrill rides and slides, and smaller community-based entertainment venues such as family entertainment and cultural venues.

In the US alone, there are nearly 30,000 attractions&amp;mdash;theme and amusement parks, attractions, water parks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, science centers, museums, and resorts, producing a total nationwide economic impact of $219 billion in 2011, according to leading international industry association, [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]] (IAAPA). The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaapa.org/resources/by-park-type/amusement-parks-and-attractions/industry-statistics|title=Amusement Park and Attractions Industry Statistics|website=www.iaapa.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4062446-investors-play-dave-and-busters|title=Investors Should Play At Dave &amp; Buster's|last=Berner|first=Mike|date=2017-04-14|work=Seeking Alpha|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, [[mobile entertainment]] or even [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] and [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]].  The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.

This term is not to be confused with [[Out-of-home advertising|out-of-home media advertising]] as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/damian-bazadona/a-new-way-to-view-social-_b_14691878.html|title=A New Way To View Social Gaming|last=Bazadona|first=Damian|date=2017-02-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{See also|History of video games}}
Digital out-of-home entertainment (also '''DOE''') is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector.  Its roots lie in the popularity of [[coin-op]]erated [[arcade video game]]s such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that [[Generation X]] will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').

When [[Generation Y]] came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines.  So while video amusement remains an integral part of the [[popular culture]] fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Michael|date=2014-06-27|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781472426956|edition= 1st|location=|pages=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dna-association.com/|title=DNA Association Website — Digital Out-of-home Interactive Entertainment Network Association|website=www.dna-association.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to help "define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact" with groups spanning from "[[family entertainment center]]s (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools".

== Key Actors in Out-of-Home Entertainment ==
=== Family Entertainment Centers ===
{{See also|family entertainment center}}The traditional [[Family entertainment center|FECs]] is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/familyctr.shtml|title=Family Entertainment Centers|website=www.whitehutchinson.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years.  The first [[Dave &amp; Buster's]] was opened in 1982 in [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas]], [[Texas]] after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their "Eat, Drink, Play, Watch" offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehutchinson.com/leisure/articles/thatseatertainment.shtml|title=That's Eatertainment!

Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese]] first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade.  Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and "anchor" attractions ([[bowling alley]]s, [[miniature golf]], [[laser tag]]s, [[batting cage]]s, [[Roller rink|roller skating rinks]], etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=1h6rBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=out+of+home+entertainment+dave+and+busters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcQoiWIrrM&amp;sig=MLxxfXmIfOk5I26_Xv8xrGA9rck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihyIaCh_DYAhXBs48KHejvC-EQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=out%20of%20home%20entertainment%20dave%20and%20busters&amp;f=false|title=The Out-of-Home Immersive Entertainment Frontier: Expanding Interactive Boundaries in Leisure Facilities|last=Williams|first=Mr Kevin|last2=Mascioni|first2=Mr Michael|date=2014-06-28|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472426956|location=|pages=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arcade Video Game Developers ===
{{See also|Arcade game|Timeline of arcade video game history}}Probably known more by the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari]] essentially created the first commercially successful video game ''[[Pong]],'' marking the beginning of the coin-operated [[video game industry]].  In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' was produced by [[Taito|Taito Corporation]] and ushered in the [[golden age of arcade video games]]. [[Namco]] (of [[Pac-Man|''Pac-Man''']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s fame), [[Nintendo]] ([[Donkey Kong (video game)|''Donkey Kong'']]), [[Konami]] ([[Frogger's Adventures: The Rescue|''Frogger'']]), [[Capcom]] ([[Street Fighter|''Street Fighters'']]), [[Sega AM2]] (''[[Daytona USA (video game)|Daytona]]'') are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.

[[Video game publisher]]s are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs ([[intellectual property]]) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between [[Ubisoft]] and LAI Games to produce ''Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride'', an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular ''[[Rabbids]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.replaymag.com/lai-december-2017/|title=LAI Virtual Rabbids – December 2017 {{!}} RePlay Magazine|website=www.replaymag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/11/ubisofts-rabbids-are-back-in-vr-with-virtual-rabbids-the-big-ride/|title=Ubisoft’s Rabbids Are Back In VR With Virtual Rabbids – The Big Ride|work=VRFocus|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blooloop.com/features/ubisoft-vr-rabbids-maze-lbe/|title=Ubisoft - Rabbids and Assassins Creed VR target new LBE audiences {{!}} blooloop|work=Blooloop|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redemption Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Redemption game}}A redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/redemption-game|title=Redemption-game dictionary definition {{!}} redemption-game defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Merchandiser|Merchandizers]] also fall in the redemption game category.)  One of the most popular redemption games, [[Skee-Ball|''Skee Ball'']], has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/why-skee-ball-doesnt-change/509117/|title=Why Skee-Ball Doesn't Change|last=Klin|first=Richard|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game ''Big Bass Wheel'') bought the rights to ''Skee-Ball'' from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/bay-tek-acquires-skeeball-the-worlds-oldest-and-re-1344?iid=24D69C2C3ECE4F6C8AA75ED13523F6EE|title=Bay Tek Acquires Skee-Ball, The World's Oldest And Renowned Arcade Alley Game Brand  {{!}} Articles {{!}} Vending Times|website=www.vendingtimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit [[midway (fair)|midway]]-style redemption games such as ''Down The Clown'' and ''Gold Fishin''.  LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded [[Timezone (video arcades)|Timezone]]) produced hit games such as [[Stacker (game)|''Stacker'']] and ''Speed of Light,'' the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in [[Nickelodeon]] TV show [[Game Shakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intergameonline.com/coin-op/news/lai-games-debuts-on-nickelodeon|title=LAI Games debuts on Nickelodeon|last=|first=|date=2015-11-10|work=InterGame: iGaming, Casino &amp; Coin-Op News|access-date=2018-01-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.

=== Simulator Video Game Manufacturers ===
{{See also|Simulation video game}}Another category of video amusement games are simulators. [[Raw Thrills]], best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as ''[[Jurassic Park Arcade]]'' and ''[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The]]'' [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''Walking Dead'']] ''Arcade'', is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs.  Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of [[Typhoon (simulator)|''Typhoon'']] - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and [[CJ Group|CJ 4DPLEX]] with their ''Mini Rider 3D'' - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.

{{Other uses|Premise (disambiguation)}}

The '''premise''' of a [[film]] or [[screenplay]] is the initial state of affairs that drives the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

Most premises can be expressed very simply, and many films can be identified simply from a short sentence describing the premise. For example: [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|''A lonely boy is befriended by an alien'']]; [[Jaws (film)|''A small town is terrorized by a shark'']]; [[The Sixth Sense|''A small boy sees dead people'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11419">{{about|a feature of jokes}}

A '''punch line''' ('''punch-line''' or '''punchline''') concludes a [[joke]]; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the [[Joke#Telling jokes|typical joke structure]]. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.

In a broader sense, punch line can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.

== Etymology ==
{{weasel|section|date=March 2018}}
The origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic "set-up, premise, punch line" format was well-established in [[Vaudeville]] by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term "punch line" is first documented in the 1920s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punch%20line|title=Definition of PUNCH LINE|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people{{who|date=March 2018}} argue the term's origin is related to the British weekly magazine ''[[Punch_(magazine)|Punch]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

M-Husler was the first person to come with a punch line in 1986.

== Linguistic analysis ==
A linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by [[Victor Raskin]] in his [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor]]. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. "The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text ''and'' opposite or incompatible with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Raskin|1985 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin’s linguistic theory to include "two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution." He explains that "… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Shultz|1976|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resolution generates laughter.

=== Prosodic features ===
There are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being [[Loudness|louder]] and of a higher [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the speech preceding it, and a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of [[Joke|humorous narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jokes without a punch line ===
In order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line it is useful to look at some joke forms which purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. [[Shaggy dog story|Shaggy dog stories]] are long-winded [[Anti-humor|anti-jokes]] in which the punch line is deliberately anti-climactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny, and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.

Another type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having "a surprising or incongruous punch line" which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ruch|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[no soap radio]] punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.

== Jab lines ==

A joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the [[Narratology|narratological structure]]. With this in mind, the [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humor]] (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term, "jab line", was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. "Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the 'plot' or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2001 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT4MBxNnYA8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=jab+lines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHo4ydQlYT&amp;sig=7Ma6QTiosOAL-YUqoDTwJI9Fd8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HDSbVeTqBNLWoATGxYDwDA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jab%20lines&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this type of humor text analysis, see &gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three part structure ==
Felicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set— the B— is the punchline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:

{{quote|
'''A''' Some men are about to be executed. The guard brings the first man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Earthquake!" Everyone is startled and looks around. In all the confusion, the first man escapes.

'''A''' The guard brings the second man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Tornado!" In the confusion, the second man escapes.

'''B''' By now the last man has it all figured out. The guard brings him forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" and the last man yells, "Fire!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Fine Brothers at the 2010 Streamy Awards.jpg|thumb|The Fine Brothers, creators of the ''React'' franchise]]
'''''React''''' (sometimes stylized in all caps as '''''REACT''''')  is a [[media franchise]] used by the [[Fine Brothers]] consisting of several online series centering on a group of individuals reacting to [[viral video]]s, trends, [[video games]], film trailers, or [[music videos]]. React was also the first react channel on YouTube. The franchise was launched with the YouTube debut of ''Kids React'' in October 2010, and then grew to encompass four more series uploaded on the Fine Brothers' primary [[YouTube]] channel, a separate YouTube channel with various reaction-related content, as well as a television series titled ''[[React to That]]''.

In 2016, the duo announced ''React World'', a program and channel in which they would license the format of their ''React'' shows to creators, which led to widespread negative reception from viewers and fellow content creators, as well as confusion about what their format is. This eventually lead to the Fine Brothers to removing all videos related to ''React World'', essentially pulling the plug on the ''React World'' program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/43sjmj/the_fine_brothers_announce_cancellation_of_react/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kids React''===
Benny and Rafi Fine launched a series titled ''Kids React'' on October 16, 2010, the first video being "Kids React to Viral Videos (''[[Double Rainbow (viral video)|Double Rainbow]]'', Obama Fail, Twin Rabbits, [[Snickers]] [[Halloween]])".{{sfn|Jaworski|2013}} The ''Kids React'' series features The Fine Brothers, off-camera, showing kids ages 4–14 (7-13 as of September 2016, 7-11 as of October 2016) several viral videos or popular YouTubers and having the kids react to the videos.{{sfn|Hallam|2010}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2010}}{{sfn|"Kids React to Epic Meal Time"|2011}}{{sfn|Whitney|2012}}

The most popular ''Kids React'' episode to date is “Kids React to Gay Marriage", with over 40.2 million views as of September 2, 2018. The popularity of ''Kids React'' made it possible for the online series to win a special [[Emmy Award]] at the [[39th Daytime Emmy Awards]] in 2012.{{sfn|Hernandez|2012}} The Emmy Award, that was given in cooperation with [[AOL]], was awarded to the Fine Brothers for "Best Viral Video Series".{{sfn|Paredes|2012}} After their Emmy win, the brothers stated, "Not a lot has changed [after winning the Emmy] other than realizing that there are shows on YouTube like ''React'' that can get similar if not better viewership than mainstream entertainment can."{{sfn|Jaworski|2013}}

Videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to by the kids include [[Smosh]] (who later reacted to the kids' reactions{{sfn|"Smosh Reacts"|2011}}), [[planking (fad)|planking]]{{sfn|Chansanchai|2011}} and [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] [[Death of Osama bin Laden#U.S. presidential address|addressing the death of]] [[Osama bin Laden]],{{sfn|Choi|2011}}{{sfn|Hustvedt|2011}} among several other topics.{{sfn|Johnson|2011}}{{sfn|Idolator Staff|2011}} ''Kids React'' has been compared to ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]''.{{sfn|Brustein|2014}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2011}} In October 2012, the kids of the show were shown videos of the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential debates]].{{sfn|Von Baldegg|2012}} ''Kids React'' won the Streamy Award for Best Non-Fiction or Reality Series in 2013.{{sfn|"Pre-Live Streamy Winners Announced"|2013}}

===''Teens React''===
Due to the popularity of ''Kids React'', The Fine Brothers spawned a spin-off dubbed ''Teens React'' on November 17, 2011 with "TEENS REACT TO [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|TWILIGHT]]".{{sfn|O'Neill|2011}} The show has a similar premise to ''Kids React'', however the younger stars are replaced with teens, some of whom have aged out of the ''Kids React'' series. Due to this, the Fine Brothers are able to show more mature and less "kid-friendly" videos such as videos on topics like ''[[Toddlers &amp; Tiaras]]'',{{sfn|Chansanchai|2012}} [[Rick Perry]]'s ''[[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#Appeals to Christian voters|Strong]]'' commercial,{{sfn|Frauenfelder|2011}} [[Suicide of Amanda Todd|Amanda Todd's death]],{{sfn|Lum|2012}} and the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential debates]]. Other viral videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to include ''[[Salad Fingers]]'', the ''[[Overly Attached Girlfriend]]'', "[[Gangnam Style]]", ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' trailer,{{sfn|Johnson|2012}} [[Shane Dawson]],{{sfn|"Shane Dawson: Watch Teens Reacting"|2012}} and [[One Direction]],{{sfn|Orenstein|2012}} among other topics.  Later on The Fine Brothers launched a series named ''Teens React: Gaming'' consisting videos of teens reacting to popular games such as ''[[Mario Kart 64]], [[Flappy Bird]]'', and ''[[Rocket League]]''.{{sfn|Hilliard|2015}} Teens React launched the career of [[Lia Marie Johnson]] and also featured some "famous" 'reactors' as guest stars, including [[Lisa Cimorelli]], [[Amy Cimorelli]], [[Lucas Cruikshank]] (who later appears in Youtubers React), [[Alex Steele]], [[Jake Short]], and [[Maisie Williams]].{{sfn|Moran|2015}}

===''Elders React''===
The popularity of ''Kids React'' and ''Teens React'' spawned ''Elders React'' on May 24, 2012 with "ELDERS REACT TO NYAN CAT". The Elders React series replaces young children and teenagers with the elderly, including Benny and Rafi's father, Yehuda.{{sfn|"Elders React To Skrillex"|2012}} Initially starting with topics that have been discussed on the other ''React'' series, they currently discuss about topics that appeals to today's 21st century society such as violent video games and music videos.

===''YouTubers React''===
The first episode of ''YouTubers React'' premiered December 6, 2012. The first episode was "YouTubers React to Viral Videos Ep. #1". Several notable YouTubers have appeared on the series.{{sfn|Gutelle|2012}} [[Tay Zonday]], [[Rebecca Black]] and [[Liam Kyle Sullivan]] have each reacted to one of their own videos, "[[Chocolate Rain]]," "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]" and "[[Shoes (Kelly song)|Shoes]]" respectively.{{sfn|Dreier|2013}}

===''Adults React''===
On May 30, 2015, the Fine Brothers announced ''Adults React'', which premiered on July 16 later that year. It consists of people ages 20 to 55, including former stars of ''Teens React'' that have aged out of the series. Depending on the video or topic, ''Adults React'' will be specific of which type of adults are going to be reacting, such as parents or young adults.{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2015}}

===''College Kids React''===
The first episode of ''College Kids React'' premiered on June 23, 2016 with "College Kids React to [[The 1975]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwfMo4BRak|title=College Kids React to The 1975|publisher=Fine Brothers Entertainment|website=[[YouTube]]|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series includes stars who have aged out of ''Teens React'' alongside new stars, as well as stars that have not yet aged out of ''Teens React'' but have begun college. The content of ''College Kids React'' is similar to the content found in ''Teens React''.

===One-off episodes===
In April 2014, as an [[April Fool's]] joke, the Fine Brothers teamed up with [[Friskies]] and released ''Cats React'', which went viral.{{sfn|Cohen|2014}} In July 2016 they released another part of ''Cats React''.

In August 2014, they released ''Celebrities React to Viral Videos''.

In April 2018, an another April Fools’s joke, they released ‘’Teens React to Nothing’’ where they showed teens a blank screen.

==React YouTube channel==
After creating four individual successful ''React'' series on their primary YouTube channel, the Fine Brothers launched a separate YouTube channel in 2014, for reaction-related content, simply dubbed "React".{{sfn|Spangler|2014}} With the intent of running programming five days a week,{{sfn|Spangler|2014}} the channel launched with five series: ''Games'' (a [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] style series with cast members from their primary ''React'' series), ''Advice'' (a series featuring cast members respond to questions from viewers), ''React Remix'' (musical remixes of past ''React'' footage), ''People Vs. Foods'' (a series featuring Reactors taste test "Weird" or international foods), and ''Lyric Breakdown'' (a series in which Reactors break down the meaning of various songs).{{sfn|Gutelle|2014}} The channel launched with a teen-centered playthrough of ''[[Goat Simulator]]''.{{sfn|Van Winkle|2014}} Similar to the teens, the elders also have played and reacted to video games such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]''. Kids and Adults also played and reacted to video games too.{{sfn|Farokhmanesh|2015}}

==''React to That''==
In early 2014, it was announced that the Fine Brothers made a deal with Ncredible Entertainment, a production studio founded by [[Nick Cannon]] to develop a television series for [[Nickelodeon]].{{sfn|Patel|2014}} The series, dubbed ''[[React to That]]'', was "entirely re-envisioned for television," as the reactors "not only watch and respond to viral videos, but pop out of the reaction room and into showdowns where the clips come to life as each reactor is confronted with a challenge based on the video they just watched."{{sfn|Block|2014}} Following the announcement of the series, Benny Fine stated, "All these viewers now watching are also pioneering what it is to be a viewer of content. They follow us through all of our different endeavors, all our different series, and now will have the opportunity to follow us to another medium."{{sfn|Block|2014}} Nickelodeon ordered 13 episodes to be produced,{{sfn|Block|2014}} but only 12 were made and aired.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}

==React World==

===Background===
In July 2015, the Fine Brothers filed for trademark protection on "React" with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).{{sfn|Spangler|2016}} The trademark was filed for "Entertainment services, namely, providing an ongoing series of programs and webisodes via the internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people."{{sfn|Hern|2016}} The USPTO approved for a 30-day opposition period which was set to begin on February 2, 2016; if no parties filed an opposition to the Fines' trademark request, it would have proceeded through the process.{{sfn|Machkovech|2016}} The brothers had previously filed for and been granted trademark registrations for "Elders React" and "Teens React" in 2013 as well as "Kids React" in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Fine mess: how not to assert your copyright in the YouTube age|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/6/10926230/fine-bros-react-world-controversy|website = The Verge|access-date = February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2016, the Fines announced that they would be launching React World, a way to grant content creators the license to create their own versions of the ''React'' shows.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} Specifically, the Fine Brothers stated they are licensing the format of their ''React'' shows.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} A ''Variety'' report detailed that React World would "aggregate videos in a channel to launch later this year to promote, support and feature fan-produced programming based on their shows."{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}  The brothers' company, Fine Brothers Entertainment (FBE) stated they would be working with YouTube and ChannelMeter on the launch of React World.{{sfn|Shah|2016}} FBE also expressed they would be able to monetize ''React''-style videos uploaded under their license.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} On monetization, ''Digital Trends'' detailed "Although licenses are free, React World creators must agree to share 20 percent of AdSense revenue and 30 percent of premium brand deals with FBE."{{sfn|Shah|2016}} Additionally, the Fines stated they will provide ongoing production guidance, creative guidelines, format bibles, and other resources, as well as promotional and technical support to those creators who participated with the brothers on React World.{{sfn|Shah|2016}}

===Reception===
Although YouTube's VP on content partnerships, Kelly Merryman, originally proclaimed "This is brand-building in the YouTube age — rising media companies building their brands through collaborations with creators around the world,"{{sfn|Spangler|2016}} the Fine Brothers were met with overwhelmingly negative reception to their React World announcement.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}}{{sfn|Shah|2016}}{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}} ''[[BBC News]]'' reported that "critics of the Fine Brothers have expressed concern they may use the trademarks to stifle competition," and quoted one YouTuber who detailed "People don't trust them because a few years ago when [[Ellen DeGeneres]] did a similar video—not that similar, it didn't have the same format or branding—they claimed it was their format."{{sfn|Foxx|2016}} Viewers and fellow content creators alike condemned the Fines for their announcement, with ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' reporting, "Backlash poured in on [[Reddit]] and social media, and other YouTubers posted their own reactions and parodies of the enthusiastically corporate React World announcement video."{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}} The backlash led to a dramatic drop in subscribers,{{sfn|Mooney|2016}} with upwards of 675,000{{#tag:ref|As of February 22, 2016. Not including positive subs counts.|group = "n"}} accounts collectively unsubscribing from the React and Fine Bros Entertainment channels as well as recent videos getting many dislikes in [[protest]] as of February 22, 2016.&lt;ref name="fbe30days"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fine Brothers Entertainment 30 days|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/thefinebros/monthly|website=Social Blade|publisher=Maker Studio|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rc30days"&gt;{{cite web|title=React Channel 30 Days|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/react/monthly|website=Social Blade|publisher=Makers Studio|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|"Fine Brothers Entertainment"|n.d.}} ''[[Mashable]]'' described that one Reddit post "ignited a thread of haters, defenders and overall discussion about whether what Fine Brothers Entertainment is doing is fair."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} [[Ryan Morrison]], a gamer, lawyer and Reddit user, declared that he would file a legal challenge to the Fine Brothers' trademark request on "React", writing "These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}}

Though there was an overwhelmingly negative response to the React World announcement, other personalities expressed milder opinions; Internet personality [[Hank Green]] wrote "this could actually be a very cool project if it could be divorced from the idea of two very powerful creators attempting to control a very popular YouTube video format. Franchising one of YouTube's biggest shows? Yeah, I’d love to see how that goes."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}} ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' reporter Jay Hathaway wrote "The trademark and React World are dead. And that's a shame, because it was an interesting idea that suffered from tone-deaf execution."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}}

===Responses and discontinuation by the Fine Brothers===
After seeing the initial backlash from their announcement, The Fine Brothers posted comments on various social media websites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], Reddit, and the comment section of their YouTube announcement video.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} On Facebook the Fines wrote, "We do not own the idea or copyright for reaction videos overall, nor did we ever say we did. You don’t need anyone’s permission to make these kinds of videos, and we’re not coming after anyone," adding "We are in no way claiming reaction content in general is our intellectual property. This is purely a voluntary program for people wanting direct support from us, and we continue to be so excited to work with all of you who may want to participate."{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} They additionally tweeted "We're not saying we hold a copyright on reaction videos overall, no one can. We're licensing our specific shows, like TV has done for years."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} The brothers also stated they would "not be trying to take revenue from other types of reaction videos, and will not be copyright-striking."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} However, other YouTubers have reported multiple copyright related video takedowns.{{sfn|8-Bit Eric|2016}}{{sfn|LeKevPlays|2016}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' also reported that unrelated channels featuring other groups of people reacting to videos were also removed after takedown requests from the Fine Brothers; the "Seniors React" video was noted to be released prior to the Fines launching their ''Elders React'' series.{{sfn|Hern|2016}} The Fines also posted an update video in response to what they described as "confusion and negative response" to React World, in which they try to clear up confusion on what their format encompasses, as well as inviting viewers to e-mail them about any further questions.{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}}

Ultimately, the Fine Brothers removed all React World videos,{{sfn|Yin-Poole|2016}} and posted a statement on ''[[Medium (website)|Medium]]'', declaring they have filed the paperwork to [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] all their "React" trademarks and applications, will discontinue the React World program, and will release all past Content ID claims.{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016b}} In their post, the brothers expressed "It makes perfect sense for people to distrust our motives here, but we are confident that our actions will speak louder than these words moving forward."{{sfn|Rundle|2016}} Reaction to this ''Medium'' post was negative on Reddit, where users were reported commenting they would not forgive the Fine Brothers.{{sfn|Rundle|2016}}

{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

{{Costume}}

'''Stage clothes''' is a term for any clothes used by performers on [[theater|stage]]. The term is sometimes used only for those clothes which are specially made for the stage performance by a [[costume design]]er or picked out by a [[Costume coordination|costume coordinator]]. Theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Stage clothes may be used to portray a historical look or they can be used to exaggerate some aspect of a character.

== Description ==
Any clothing used by performers ([[singer]]s, [[actor]]s, or [[dancer]]s) on [[theater|stage]] may be referred to as stage clothes. More specifically, the term is sometimes used only for those clothes which are specially made for the stage performance by a [[costume design]]er or picked out by a [[Costume coordination|costume coordinator]]. However, many performers also pick up regular clothes and make them their "[[trademark look]]" on stage.

== Use ==
In combination with other aspects, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Often, stylized theatrical costumes can exaggerate some aspect of a character; for example [[Harlequin]] and [[Pantalone|Pantaloon]] in the traditional [[commedia dell'arte]].

Usually, in costume, historical accuracy is combined with a certain vision. The character that the costumer is dressing is also an important aspect, and a lot of the time the attitudes of the character is not exactly in line with the time period. For example, they may be more bright and colorful, or they may be more dull. A movie or stage production which emphasize the use of correct clothes and settings for a specific time period is called a [[costume drama]].

Stage clothes often follow the evolving fashion but in a more extravagant way.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} Clothes worn by popular performers can often spark new fashions by themselves, as fans of performers want to look like their idols.

[[File:One-man band street performer - 5.jpg|thumb|215px|Jeffrey Masin, a [[one-man band]] in New York City]]

'''Street performance''' or '''busking''' is the act of performing in public places for [[gratuity|gratuities]]. In many countries the rewards are generally in the form of money but other gratuities such as food, drink or gifts may be given. Street performance is practiced all over the world and dates back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. People engaging in this practice are called '''street performers''' or '''buskers'''.

Performances are anything that people find [[entertainment|entertaining]]. Performers may do [[acrobatics]], [[Animal training|animal tricks]], [[balloon modelling|balloon twisting]], [[caricature]]s, [[clown]]ing, comedy, [[contortion]]s, [[escapology]], dance, singing, [[Fire performance|fire skills]], [[flea circus]], [[fortune-telling]], [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[living statue]], [[music]]al performance, [[puppeteer]]ing, [[snake charming]], [[storytelling]] or reciting poetry or [[prose]], [[street art]] such as [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] and painting, [[street theatre]], [[sword swallowing]], and [[ventriloquism]].

== Etymology ==
The term ''busking'' was first noted in the English language around the middle 1860s in Great Britain. The verb ''to busk'', from the word ''busker'', comes from the Spanish root word ''buscar'', with the meaning "to seek".&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=busker "busker"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish word ''buscar'' in turn evolved from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word ''*bhudh-skō'' ("to win, conquer").&lt;ref name="Diccionario RAE"&gt;{{citation |url= http://dle.rae.es/?id=6LB1acb |title= buscar |work= Diccionario de la Lengua Española |edition=23rd |publisher= [[Real Academia Española]] |language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many street acts, and title of a famous Spanish book about one of them, ''[[El Buscón]]''. Today, the word is still used in Spanish but mostly relegated for female street sex workers, or women seeking to be set up as private mistress of married men.

== History ==
There have been performances in public places for [[gratuities]] in every major culture in the world, dating back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. For many musicians street performance was the most common means of employment before the advent of [[sound recording|recording]] and personal electronics.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;Baird, Stephen (2000).[http://www.buskersadvocates.org/saahistory.html#saafranklin "The History and Cultural Impact of Street Performing in America: Ben Franklin"]. Street Performers and Buskers Advocates. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, a person had to produce any music or entertainment, save for a few mechanical devices such as the [[barrel organ]], the [[music box]], and the [[piano roll]]. [[Organ grinder]]s were commonly found busking in the old days.

Busking is common among some [[Romani people]]. Romantic mention of Romani music, dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry, prose and lore. The Roma brought the word busking to England by way of their travels along the [[Mediterranean]] coast to Spain and the Atlantic Ocean and then up north to England and the rest of Europe.

In medieval France buskers were known by the terms [[troubadour]]s and ''jongleurs''. In northern France they were known as trouveres. In old German buskers were known as [[Minnesingers]] and ''Spielleute''. In obsolete French it evolved to ''busquer'' for "seek, prowl" and was generally used to describe prostitutes. In Russia buskers are called [[skomorokh]] and their first recorded history appears around the 11th century.

[[Mariachi]]s, Mexican bands that play a style of music by the same name, frequently busk when they perform while traveling through streets and plazas, as well as in restaurants and bars.&lt;ref name="WebsterMariachi"&gt;[http://www.webster.com/dictionary/mariachi "mariachi"] Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=We like playing for big crowds, and the goal all along has been for people to pay a little to come and see us. But it all started on street corners, and that is still very connected to what we do. It's such a validating musical experience. Busking is a very humble and brave act that takes courage to do well. It's also about the energy of music being alive outside in a city ... You can walk right by it right in front of you. Sure, to some people you're just another guy with his hand out, so sometimes busking can be great social barometer.

Around the mid-19th century Japanese ''[[Chindonya]]'' started to be seen using their skills for advertising, and these street performers are still occasionally seen in Japan. Another Japanese street performance form dating from the [[Edo period]] is [[Nankin Tamasudare]], in which the performer creates large figures using a bamboo mat.

In the United States, [[medicine show]]s proliferated in the 19th century. They were traveling vendors selling [[elixir]]s and [[potion]]s to improve the health. They would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better. The people would often associate this feeling of well-being with the products sold. After these performances they would "pass the hat".

[[One-man band]]s have historically performed as buskers playing a variety of instruments simultaneously. One-man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 19th and early 20th centuries and still perform to this day. A current one-man band plays all their instruments acoustically usually combining a guitar, a harmonica, a drum and a tambourine. They may also include singing. Many still busk but some are booked to play at festivals and other events.

[[Folk music]] has always been an important part of the busking scene. Cafe, restaurant, bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form. Two of the more famous folk singers are [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Joan Baez]]. The [[delta blues]]men were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the Mississippi Delta region of the USA around the early 1940s and on. [[B.B. King]] is one famous example who came from these roots.

The [[counterculture]] of the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s occasionally staged "be-ins", which resembled some present-day busker festivals. Bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free, passing the hat to make money. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] was at the epicenter of this movement – be-ins were staged at [[Golden Gate Park]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'s Bee Stadium and other venues. Some of the bands that performed in this manner were [[Janis Joplin]] with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Moby Grape]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].

[[Christmas carol]]ing can also be a form of busking, as [[wassailing]] included singing for alms, [[wassail]] or some other form of refreshment such as [[figgy pudding]]. In Ireland the traditional Wren Boys and in England [[Morris Dancing]] can be considered part of the busking tradition.

In India and Pakistan's [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] region [[Bhavai]] is a form of street art where there are plays enacted in the village, the [[barot (caste)|barot]] or the village singer also is part of the local entertainment scene.

In the 2000s, some performers have begun "Cyber Busking". Artists post work or performances on the Internet for people to download or "stream" and if people like it they make a donation using [[PayPal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Forms ==
There are three basic forms of street performance

'''"Circle shows"''' are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them. They usually have a distinct beginning and end. Usually these are done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], comedians, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[juggle]]rs and sometimes musicians. Circle shows can be the most lucrative. Sometimes the crowds attracted can be very large. A good busker will control the crowd so the patrons do not obstruct foot traffic.

'''"Walk-by acts"''' are typically where the busker performs a musical, living statue or other act that does not have a distinct beginning or end and the public usually watch for a brief time. A walk by act may turn into a circle show if the act is unusual or very popular.

'''"Stoplight performers"''' present their act and get contributions from vehicle occupants on a crosswalk while the traffic lights are red. A variety of disciplines can be used in such format (juggling, break dancing, even magic tricks). Because of the short period of time available to them, stoplight performers must have a very brief, condensed routine. This form is seen more commonly in Central and South America than elsewhere.

=== Collecting money ===

Buskers collect donations and tips from the public in a variety of containers and by different methods depending on the type of busking they are performing. For walk by acts their instrument case or a special can or box is often used. For circle shows the performer will typically collect money at the end of the show, although some performers will also collect during the show to ensure all audience members have had a chance to show appreciation for their skills. Sometimes a performer will employ a ''bottler'', ''hat man'', or ''pitch man'' to collect money from the audience. The term ''bottler'' is a British term which originated following the use of the top half of a bottle to collect money. The bottle had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached. This design allowed coins to be put in the bottle but not allow them to be removed easily without the coins jingling against the glass. The first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous [[Punch and Judy]] troupe of puppeteers in early Victorian times.&lt;ref name="Punch"&gt;Somerville, Chris (1997) [http://www.punchandjudy.com/bottle.htm Who is Mr Punch] ''punchandjudy.com''. Chris Somerville. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottling itself can be an art form, and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch. A good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money. A bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch. Prior to the 20th century, it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler. That practice has diminished or ceased in many countries due to changes in social attitudes and animal control laws. However some modern buskers use a device known as [[monkey stick]] which is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached to make a noise before a show or prior to making a collection.

The place where a performance occurs is called a "pitch". A good pitch can be the key to success as a busker. An act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting. Popular pitches tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic, high visibility, low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible. Good locations may include tourist spots, popular parks, entertainment districts including lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs and theaters, [[rapid transit|subways]] and bus stops, outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events, almost any [[plaza]] or [[town square]] as well as [[zócalo]]s in Latin America and [[piazza]]s in other regions. Other places include shopping malls, strip malls, and outside supermarkets, although permission is usually required from management for these.

In her book, ''Underground Harmonies: Music and Politics in the Subways of New York'', Susie J. Tanenbaum examined how the adage "Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast" plays out in regards to busking. Her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform, crime rates tended to go down, and that those with higher education attainment tended to have a more positive view of buskers than did those of lesser educational attainment.&lt;ref name="Tanenbaum"&gt;Tanenbaum, Susie, J.

Many cities in the United States have particular areas known to be popular spots for buskers. Performers are found at many locations like Mallory Square in [[Key West]], in [[New Orleans]], in New York around [[Central Park]], [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], and the subway systems, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. around the transit centers, in Los Angeles around [[Venice Beach]], the [[Santa Monica]] [[Third Street Promenade]], and the Hollywood area, in Chicago on [[Maxwell Street]], in the [[Delmar Loop]] district of [[St. Louis]], and many other locations throughout the US.
Busking is still quite common in Scotland, Ireland, and England with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels.

In the United States under [[constitutional law]] and most European [[common law]], the protection of [[artistic]] [[free speech]] extends to busking. In the U.S. and many countries, the designated places for free speech behavior are the public [[park]]s, streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[thoroughfare]]s and [[town square]]s or [[plaza]]s. Under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers, particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://funandmagic.com/decision.pdf Berger v.

While there is no universal [[code of conduct]] for buskers, there are common law practices which buskers must conform to. Most jurisdictions have corresponding [[statutory law]]. In the UK busking regulation is not universal with most laws (if there are any) being governed local councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who, what, why: Where is the hardest place in the UK to be a busker?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28112716|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some towns in the British Isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In Great Britain places requiring licenses for buskers may also require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Oxford City Council have decided to enact a [[public space protection order]]. Some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules. Some places require a special [[License|permit]] to use electronically amplified sound and may have limits on the [[Loudness|volume]] of sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411newyork.org/guide/2007/07/16/street-performances-in-new-york/ |title=Street Performances in New York |publisher=411newyork.org |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow, block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits, or do things that [[endangerment|endanger]] the public. It is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night. These curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is common law that "performing blue" (i.e. using material that is sexually explicit or any vulgar or obscene remarks or gestures) is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults-only environment such as in a bar or pub.

In London, busking is prohibited in the entire borough of the City of London. The London Underground provides busking permits in tube stations. Most London boroughs do not license busking, but they have optional powers, under the London Local Authorities Act 2000, if there is sufficient reason to do so. Where these powers have not been adopted, Councils can rely on other legislation including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to deal with noise nuisance from buskers and the Highways Act to deal with obstructions. Camden Council is currently looking into further options to control the problem of nuisance buskers and the playing of amplified music to the detriment of local residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-insider.co.uk/2010/02/busking-in-london-explained-guide/|title= The Big Busk: London Busking Explained |author=Appleton, Natalie |date=7 February 2010|publisher= The London Insider|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft. Buskers may have their earnings, instruments or props stolen. One particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead, a practice known as "dipping" or "skimming". [[George Burns]] described his days as a youthful busker this way:&lt;ref name="CigarBurns"&gt;[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html The Ultimate Cigar Aficionado: Ninety-eight-year-old George Burns Shares Memories of His Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307054715/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,3,00.html |date=7 March 2010 }}, article and interview by Cigar Aficionado Online&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television crew''' positions are derived from those of [[film crew]], but with several differences.

== Pre-Production  ==
{{main|Pre-production}}

: Work before shooting begins is called the pre-production stage. The crew in this stage include the [[casting director]], [[costume designer]], [[Television director|director]], [[location manager]], [[make-up artist]], researcher, [[screenwriter]], [[set designer]], and [[television producer]].

===Casting director===
{{main|Casting director}}

: The casting director casts actors, and so is usually one of the first crew members on the project.  In fact, during initial casting for a television pilot, the executive producer and casting director are often the only crew members.

===Costume designer===

: The '''costume designer''' makes all the clothing and costumes worn by all the Actors on screen, as well as designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colours, and sizes. They greatly contribute to the appearance of the production, and set a particular mood, time, feeling, or genre. They alter the overall appearance of a project with their designs and constructions, including impacting on the style of the project, and how the audience interprets the show's characters.

===Director===
{{main|Television director}}

: A '''television director''' is usually responsible for directing the actors and other filmed aspects of a television production. The role differs from that of a film director because the major creative control usually belongs to the producer. In general, actors and other regular artists on a show are familiar enough with their roles that the director's input is confined to technical issues. The director is responsible for all creative aspects of a production. The director typically helps hire the cast (and possibly crew). The Director helps decide on locations, and creates a shooting plan. During shooting, the director supervises the overall project, manages shots, and keeps the assignment on budget and schedule. Though directors hold much power, they are  second in command after the producer. The producer usually hires the director (unless the director is also the producer). Some directors produce their own television programs, and, with formal approval of the funding studio, enjoy a tighter grip on what makes the final cut than Directors usually have.

* '''Associate director''' ('''AD''')
{{main|Assistant director}}

: An '''associate director (AD)''' in television production is usually responsible for floor directing in the studio and ensuring that the sets, props and technical equipment are safe, ready to use and positioned correctly before filming. Associate directors are also responsible for communications with the [[audience]] and any guests, for example ensuring they are seated in good time, and assisting the Director with production. In scripted television series, an associate director occasionally serves as an episode's director, in which case someone else substitutes for the AD. Until the mid-2000s in the United States, associate directors were usually credited as ''technical coordinators'', for most sitcoms were shot on film. Drama programs don't usually use ADs.

===Location manager===
{{main|Location manager}}

: The '''location manager''' finds and manages film locations. Most pictures are shot in the controllable environment of a studio [[sound stage]] but occasionally, outdoor sequences call for filming [[Filming location|on location]].

===Make-up artist===
{{main|Make-up artist}}

: A professional '''make-up artist''' is usually a [[cosmetology]] beautician, and applies makeup to anyone who appears on screen. They concentrate on the area above the chest, the face, the top of the head, the fingers, hands, arms, and elbows. Their role is to manipulate the actor's on-screen appearance to make them look younger, older, larger, etc.
: [[Body makeup artist]]s concentrate on the body rather than the head. Make-up itself is substances to enhance the beauty of the human body, but can also change the appearance, disguise, or costume someone. Make-up artists, [[hair stylist]]s, [[costume designer]]s, and [[theatrical technician#Wardrobe|dress technician]]s combine their efforts to transform actors into characters, presenters, etc.

===Production designer===
{{main|Production designer}}

: The '''production designer''' is responsible for the production's visual appearance.They design, plan, organize, and arrange set design, equipment availability, and control a production's on-screen appearance. The production designer is often called the ''[[set designer]]'', or ''[[scenic designer]]''. They are trained professionals, often with [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degrees in scenic design. The set designer collaborates with the theater director to create an environment for the production—and communicates details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[charge scenic artist]] and [[property master]]. Scenic designers create drawings and scale models of the scenery. The set designer also takes instructions from the [[art director]] to create the appearance of the stage, and design its technical assembly. The art director, who may also be the [[production designer]], plans and oversees the formation of settings for a project. They must be well versed in art and design styles, including architecture and interior design. They also work with the [[Cinematographer]] to accomplish the precise appearance for the project.

===Researcher===
{{main|Researcher}}

: '''Researchers''' research the project ahead of shooting time to increase truth, factual content, creative content, original ideas, background information, and sometimes performs minor searches such as flight details, location conditions, accommodation details, etc. They inform the director, producer, and writer of factual information—technical, cultural, historical, etc.—that relates to events that the production portrays.

===Set designer===
{{main|Set designer}}

The scenic designer collaborates with the theatre director and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production, and then communicates details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[production manager]], [[charge artist]], and [[property master]].  Scenic designers create [[scale model]]s of the scenery, [[artistic rendering]]s, paint elevations, and scale construction drawings to communicate with other production staff.

===Television producer===
{{main|Television producer}}

: In the entertainment industry, a '''television producer''' (compare to film producer) is generally in charge of, or helps coordinate, the financial, legal, administrative, technological, and artistic aspects of a production. In television, a '''television producer''' can be given one of the following titles:

* '''Associate producer'''
: The '''associate producer''' performs limited producing functions under the authority of a producer; often in charge of the day-to-day running of a production. Usually the producer's head assistant, although the task can differ. They frequently form a connection between everyone involved in shooting (the [[production team]]) and the people involved after filming to finalize the production, and get it publicized (the ''[[post-production]] team''). Occasionally, credit for this role goes to the product's financial backer, or the person who originally brought the assignment to the producer.

* '''Assistant Producer''' ('''AP''')
: In the UK, '''assistant producer''' is the closest role to that of a film director. An assistant producer often doubles as an experienced researcher, and takes direct charge of the creative content and action within a programme. The title of television director is usually reserved for [[dramatic programming]], productions and most similar to films, or those who control a multi-camera set up from the ''gallery''.

* '''Co-producer'''
: Typically performs producing functions in tandem with one or more other '''co-producers''' (working as a team, rather than separately on different aspects of the production).

* '''Coordinating producer'''
: The coordinating producer coordinates the work of two or more producers working separately on one or more productions.

* '''Executive producer'''
{{main|Executive producer}}

: The executive producer supervises one or more producers in all aspects of their work, and sometimes initiated the production. They are usually the ultimate authority on creative and business aspects of the production. If the title is designated correctly, the executive producer arranges the project's financial backing and maintains a sound [[production budget]]. On scripted programs, the [[showrunner]] receives an executive producer credit.

* '''Line producer'''
{{main|Line producer}}

: A line producer supervises physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects), including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. The line producer oversees the budget. This involves operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The Line Producer works with the [[Production manager]] on costs and expenditure.

* '''Segment producer'''
: Produces one or more components of a multipart production.

* '''Supervising producer'''
: Supervises one or more producers in some or all aspects of their work; usually works under the authority of an executive producer.

Additionally, more senior members of a television show's writing staff are credited as producers, with the specific title dependent upon the seniority and rate of pay for the writer. For example, a writer credited as a "co-executive producer" will typically receive a higher salary and be considered more senior than a writer credited as a "producer", who will in turn be higher "ranking" than a writer credited as "co-producer."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scriptmag.com/features/writers-room-101-tv-writer-job-titles&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writer===
{{main|Writer}}

: The '''Writer''' creates and moulds an original story, or adapts other written, told, or acted stories for production of a television show. Their finished work is called a script. A script may also have been a contribution of many writers, so it is the [[Writers Guild of America]]'s (WGA) task to designate who gets the credit as 'the Writer'. 'Written by' in the credits, is a Writers Guild of America assigned terminology that means, "Original Story and Screenplay By." A screenplay or script is a blueprint for producing a motion picture, and a [[teleplay]] is the same thing for a television show. Writers can also come under the category of screenwriters. Screenwriters (also called ''script writers''), are authors who write screenplays for productions. Many also work as ''[[script doctor]]s'', changing scripts to suit directors or studios. Script-doctoring can be lucrative, especially for better known writers. Most professional screenwriters are unionized, and are represented by organizations such as the WGA.

===Head writer===
{{main|Head writer}}

: A head writer oversees the writing team on a television or radio series. The title is common in the soap opera genre, and in sketch comedies and talk shows that feature monologues and comedy skits. In prime time series, an executive producer fills this function.

===Screenwriter===
{{main|Screenwriter}}

'''Screenwriters''' or '''scenarists''' or '''scriptwriters''' create short or feature-length screenplays for films and television programs.

===Story editor===
{{main|Story editor}}

: Story editor is a job title in motion picture filmmaking and television production, also sometimes called ''supervising producer''. A story editor is a member of the screenwriting staff who edits stories for screenplays.

==Production==
: Everything that happens as part of shooting the film is part of the ''production stage''. The crew in this stage include the [[cinematographer]], [[production manager]], [[technical director]], [[boom operator (media)|boom operator]], [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]], [[dolly grip]], [[key grip]], and [[stunt coordinator]].

===A1===
{{main|Audio Engineer}}
In television and live event production, the A1 is the primary audio engineer responsible for the technical design and operation of associated sound systems (eg. mixers, microphones, intercom, IFB, RF equipment, PA/monitoring, music/sfx playback, multi-track recording, and more).  Generally speaking, the A1 supervises all audio crew members during build, rehearsal, and show phases of any production.  Ultimately, the A1 will have routed, recorded, and mixed all sound sources heard during the program broadcast.

===A2===
The A2 helps get microphones or other audio devices to the right place or to the right person 
: An ''audio assistant (A2)'' positions and interconnects audio devices, such as [[microphone]]s and [[intercom]]s, from the television [[production truck]] to the venue. Typically, larger productions use two or more A2s.

===Boom operator===
{{main|Boom operator (media)}}

: The '''boom operator''' is part of the sound crew, and an assistant to the [[sound engineer]] or [[production sound mixer]]. The boom operator's main responsibility is [[microphone]] placement, sometimes using a "fishpole" with a microphone attached to the end—and sometimes using a "boom" (most often a "fisher boom"). The fisher boom is a piece of equipment that the operator stands on that lets him precisely control the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They also place [[wireless microphone]]s on actors when necessary. The boom operator strives to keep the microphone boom near the action, but away from the camera frame so it never appears onscreen. They work closely with the production sound mixer, or sound recordist, to record all sound while filming including background noises, dialogue, sound effects, and silence.

===Camera operator/cinematographer/videographer===
{{main|Camera operator|cinematographer|videographer}}

: As the head member of the camera crew, the '''camera operator''' uses the camera as instructed by the Director. They ensure the required action is correctly filmed in the frame, and must react instinctively as the proceedings take place. If the camera operator is also a '''[[cinematographer]]''', they also help establish the theme and appearance of the show. The cinematographer—or [[director of photography]] (DP)—regulates lighting for every scene, frames some shots, chooses lenses, decides on film stock, and strives to match the project's visual appearance to the director's vision. However, the cinematographer does not usually move the camera on the set, as this is usually the exclusive role of a camera operator.

===Character generator operator/Aston/Duet operator===
: The '''character generator (CG) [[Operator (profession)|Operator]]''' prepares and displays [[digital on-screen graphics]] (DOG or BUG) and [[lower third]] graphics on the [[character generator]] that were created by the [[broadcast designer]].

===Floor manager===
{{main|Floor manager}}

: The '''floor manager''' represents the director on the studio floor, and gives instructions and direction to crew, cast, and guests. It is closest to the role of an assistant director, as the job frequently entails barking orders to keep a production on schedule. The floor manager is always in direct contact with the director via ''[[Talkback (recording)|talkback]]'' in the gallery. The floor manager also checks that the floor is clear and safe for the performance, checks that scenery and set pieces are ready, turns on appropriate lights, makes announcements to staff and audience, helps maintain quietness and order, calls cues, and prompts talents as required.

* '''Assistant floor manager'''
: An '''assistant floor manager (AFM)''' sets the stage, prompts contributors on the studio floor, and ensures that everyone knows their place in the script. This frees the floor manager for other duties. They often oversee a team of runners. Increasingly, assistant floor managers are asked to help design and prepare props, and help set and reset action on the studio floor.

===Graphics coordinator===
{{main|Graphics coordinator}}

: The '''graphics coordinator''' ('''GC''') decides what graphic content should be displayed on-air—such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a lower third (a bar graphic in the lower third of the screen). The GC should not be confused with the Duet operator, who usually operates the Duet and is part of a television crew, or a [[Broadcast designer]] who physically creates the graphics.

===Stage manager===
{{main|Stage manager}}

: Stage managers organize and coordinate theatrical productions. The job encompasses a variety of activities, including organizing the production and coordinating communications between various personnel (e.g., between director and backstage crew, or actors and [[production management]]). Stage management is a sub-discipline of [[stagecraft]].

===Gaffer===
{{main|Gaffer (motion picture industry)}}

: The '''gaffer''' is the head electrician at the production set, and is in charge of lighting the stage under direction of the [[Cinematographer]]. In television, the term '''chief lighting director''' is often used instead of gaffer, and sometimes the [[technical director]] lights the set. The gaffer reports to the [[director of photography]], lighting director. or lighting designer, and usually has an assistant called a '''[[best boy]]''' and a crew of electricians.

===Grip (job)===
{{main|Grip (job)}}

: In the U.S. and Canada, grips are lighting and rigging technicians in the film and video industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or camera cranes. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot under the direction of the director of photography.

* '''Key grip'''
{{main|Key grip}}

: The '''key grip'' is the head grip. Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and occasionally maneuver camera cranes, dollies, and platforms under direction from the Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who is also part of the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer.

* '''Dolly grip'''
{{main|Dolly grip}}

: In [[cinematography]], the '''dolly grip''' places and moves the dolly track where required, and then pushes and pulls the dolly along that track during filming. A dolly grip works closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements through rehearsals. For moving shots, dolly grips may also push the wheeled platform that holds the microphone and [[Boom operator (media)|Boom Operator]]. The dolly is a cart that the tripod and camera (and occasionally the camera crew) rest on. It transports the camera without bumps and visual interruptions throughout a shot. It is commonly used to follow beside an actor to give the audience the sense of walking with the actor, or as the actor.

===Gallery/control room team===
{{main|Production control room}}

: These crew positions are only used on a ''[[multiple-camera setup]]'' production. The ''gallery'', or ''production control room'', is a separate darkened area away from the studio floor, where the action can be viewed on multiple monitors and controlled from a single source.

===Production manager===
{{main|Production manager}}

: The '''production manager''' makes deals concerned with business about the crew, and organizes the technical needs of the production. This would involve many things ranging from gaining the correct equipment with the exact technical requirements; to arranging accommodation for the cast and crew. The Production Manager reports their expenses and needs to the Line Producer.

===Production assistant===
{{main|Production assistant}}

: The '''production assistant (PA)''' occupies a prompting role in the Gallery or Control Room. They communicate with the broadcasting channel during a live television broadcast, counting down time-to-transmission aloud to the crew via the studio microphone. They also count down time remaining for sections of a programme, such as an interview or an advertising break. Prior to a production, the PA prepares and times the script, noting pre-recorded inserts, [[sound effect]]s, etc.—and clears copyright and other administrative issues.

===Runner===
{{main|Gofer}}
{{distinguish|Showrunner}}

: '''Runners''' are the most junior members of a television crew. They fetch and carry, and do most production odd jobs. They support anyone who needs help until they learn enough to assume more responsibility. In the United States, this position is called a ''[[gofer]]''.

===Stunt coordinator===
{{main|Stunt coordinator}}

:Where the programme requires a [[stunt]], and involves the use of [[stunt performer]]s, the '''stunt coordinator''' arranges casting and performance for the [[stunt]], working closely with the television director.

===Technical director===
{{main|Technical Director}}

: In a [[production control room]] (PCR), the '''technical director''' ('''TD''') has overall responsibility for the operation of the production. The technical director ensures that all equipment in the PCR operates correctly. They also match the quality and the output of all the cameras on the studio floor through the [[camera control unit]]s (CCU) (Vision Engineering). The TD supervises the other crew members in the PCR. The technical director also coordinates the working of the whole crew, and handles technical problem before, during, or after the shooting of a project.

===Television director – director===
{{main|Television director}}

: Unlike the film counterpart, a director in television usually refers to the gallery (or control room) director, who is responsible for the creative look of a production through selecting which shots to use at any given moment. The director views the action on the studio floor through a bank of screens, each linked to one of the [[professional video camera|cameras]], while issuing instructions down to the [[floor manager]]. They also control the gallery area, calling for sound rolls, [[digital on-screen graphic]]s (''[[Astons]]'') and video rolls [[video tape recorder]] (''VT's''). Some directors also work more closely with on-camera talent and others also act as both producer and director.

===Video control operator/vision engineering===
{{main|Broadcast engineering}}

: A '''video control operator''' (typically credited as ''video control'', and sometimes as a ''video engineer'' or ''video operator'') controls the video console to regulate transmission of content—everything from test patterns to live and recorded telecasts. Video control operators view the action on set through [[video monitor]]s and set switches and observe dials on the video console to control contrast, framing, brilliance, color balance, and the fidelity of the transmitted image. They monitor the program to ensure broadcast technical quality, and review the program to determine that the signal functions properly and is ready for transmission on schedule. Video control operators and video tape operators are used only in television productions recorded on video tape because of the growing use of [[broadcast automation]] with [[video server]]s.

===Camera Control Unit Operator===
{{main|Broadcast engineering}}

: A '''Camera control unit operator''' (typically credited as ''CCU Operator'' controls the Camera Control Unit which is a series of camera remote controls for exposure, white balance, contrast to regulate the picture quality between multiple cameras.

===Video tape operator===
: The '''video tape operator''' ('''VT operator''' or '''VTR operator''') cues and prepares video inserts into a program. A VT operator sets up and operates [[video tape]] equipment to record and play back the program, reads the program log to ascertain when to record the program, and when it airs. They also select sources, such as satellite or studio, for the program, and select the video recording equipment to use. They are heavily used in sports programming, and in all video taped productions, including [[television news]] programming, and sometimes sitcoms, if they are shot on video tape), they are also responsible for action replays and quickly editing highlights while a show is in progress. As the title suggests, video tape operators only work in video taped production. Although, VTR operator's still work on digital productions. It is a name that has just stuck to the playback operator. They can also be on set editors to give the director and director of photography the ability to see how what they shot cuts together.

===Vision mixer===
{{main|Technical director}}

: The '''vision mixer''', or '''[[technical director]]''' ('''TD''') in the United States, switches between video sources—such as camera shots and video inserts. They also maintain colour and contrast balance between the studio cameras. A [[vision mixer]] (Video Switcher) is, confusingly, also the name of the equipment the technical director operates.

==Post-production==
{{main|Post-production}}

: Everything after shooting of a film is '''post production'''. People involved in this stage of production include the film editor for film editing, video editor for [[video editing]], publicist for publicity, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], [[Foley artist]], composer, [[Broadcast designer|title sequence designer]], and [[specialist editor]]s.

===Colorist===
{{Main|Color grading}}
:The colorist interprets the program's visual look, often supervised by post-production producers and the [[cinematographer]]. Digital tools in the [[color grading]] suite control brightness, contrast, color, and the general "mood" of each shot, usually in an effort to make a scene appear to flow naturally from one shot to the next.

===Composer===
{{Main|Composer}}

: A '''composer''' writes the music for a production. They may also conduct an orchestra, or part of an orchestra, that plays the music. The composer occasionally writes theme music for a television show. A television program's theme music is a melody closely associated with the show, usually played during the [[title sequence]] and end [[closing credits]]. If accompanied by lyrics, it is a ''theme song''.

===Editor===
{{main|Film editing|Video editing}}

[[Image:editor in linear suite.png|thumb|right|Editor in linear suite]]
: The editor works in tandem with the director to edit raw footage into a finished work. The director has ultimate accountability for editing choices, but often the editor contributes substantially to the creative decisions concerned in piecing together a finalized product. Often, the editor commences their role whilst filming is still in process, by compiling initial takes of footage. It is an extremely long process to edit a television show, demonstrating the importance, and significance editing has on a production. Gradually more editors work on [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE), limiting physical touching of the actual film, decreasing film corruption due to touch.

: The Editor follows the screenplay as the guide for establishing the structure of the story, and assembles the various shots and takes for greater, clearer artistic effect. There are several editing stages. In the first stage, the editor is supervised by the director, who conveys their vision to the Editor. Therefore, this first [[rough cut]] is created during ''[[offline editing]]''. After the first stage, the following cuts may be supervised by one or more television producers, who represent the [[production company]] and its investors. Consequently, the final cut is the one that most closely represents what the studio wants from the film, and not necessarily what the director wants during ''[[online editing]]''.

===Foley artist===
{{main|Foley artist}}

: The '''Foley artist''' on a film crew creates and records many of the sound effects. Foley artists, editors, and supervisors are highly specialized and essential for producing a professional-sounding soundtrack—often reproducing commonplace yet essential sounds like footsteps or the rustle of clothing. The Foley artist also fabricates sounds that weren't correctly recorded while filming, much like the [[Audio mixing (film and television)|Sound editor]] does with digital sound effects.

===Post-production runner===
: A '''post-production runner''', unlike a [[production runner]], carries out tasks essential to the smooth running of a post-production house. [[Television crew#Runner|Runner]]s are the most junior members of a post-production team.

===Publicist===
{{main|Publicist}}

: A '''publicist''', or '''[[advertiser]]''' has the task of raising public awareness of a production, and ultimately increase viewers and sales of it and its merchandise. The publicist's main task is to stimulate demand for a product through advertising and promotion. Advertisers use several recognizable techniques in order to better convince the public to buy a product. These may include:

*'''Repetition:''' Some advertisers concentrate on making sure their product is widely recognized. To that end, they simply attempt to make the name remembered through repetition.
*'''Bandwagon:''' By implying that the product is widely viewed, advertisers hope to convince potential buyers to "get on the bandwagon."
*'''Testimonials:''' Advertisers often attempt to promote the superior worth of their product through the testimony of ordinary users, experts, or both. For example, using film critics or media personalities. This approach often involves an appeal to authority such as a doctor of media science.
*'''Pressure:''' By attempting to make people choose quickly and without long consideration, some advertisers hope to make rapid sales, and a sense of urgency to watch or buy a product.
*'''Association:''' Advertisers often attempt to associate their product with desirable things, in order to make it seem equally desirable. The use of attractive models, picturesque landscapes, and other similar imagery is common. "Buzzwords" with desired associations are also used.
*'''Imagery:''' Using advertising slogans, logos, or a common image increases familiarity, trust, personality of a production, and the ability for the show to be remembered.

The publicist ensures the media are well aware of a project by distributing the show as a trial run or sneak preview. They issue press releases and arrange interviews with cast and crew members. They may arrange public visits to the set, or distribute media kits that contain pictures, posters, clips, shorts, trailers, and descriptions of the show.

===Sound editor===
{{main|Sound editor (filmmaking)|Audio engineering}}

: In television, the '''sound editor''' deals with audio editing, adjusting and fixing of the soundtrack. They usually have a major decision-making and creative role when it comes to sound and audio. A sound editor also decides what [[sound effect]]s to use and what effects to achieve from the sound effects, edits and makes new sounds using filters and combining sounds, shaping sound with volume curves, and equalizing. A sound editor places the '''[[Foley artist]]'s''' sounds into the sound track. Often, a sound editor uses a sound effects library, either self-compiled, bought or both.

===Title sequence designer===
{{main|Broadcast designer}}

: A [[title sequence]], in a television program, appears at the beginning of the show and displays the show name and credits, usually including actors, producers and, directors. A montage of selected images and a theme song are often included to suggest the essential tone of the series. A title sequence is essential in preparing the audience for the following program, and gives them a sense of familiarity that makes them trust, and feel comfortable with the film. It is up to the '''title sequence designer''' to achieve this very goal, and make it catchy, entertaining.

==Specialist editors==

===ADR editor===
: [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Automatic dialogue replacement]] (ADR) is the process of replacing dialogue that was recorded incorrectly during filming, with the actors voices recorded and put into place during editing. The [[ADR editor]] oversees the procedure and takes the corrupted dialogue, and replaces it with newly recorded lines to the actor's mouth on film to make it lip sync correctly.

===Bluescreen director/matte Artist===
: Bluescreen is the film technique of shooting foreground action against a blue background, which is then replaced by a separately shot ''background plate'' scene by either optical effects or digital composting. This process is directed and co-ordinated by the [[Bluescreen Director]]. The matte artist is a part of the special effects department who assists in making scenery and locations that do not exist. They assemble backgrounds using traditional techniques or computers that mix with the footage filmed to create a false set. Both are fairly alike, but [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] technology is more modern and more widely used.

===Visual effects artist ===
: visual effects artist ([[VFX]]) are used in television productions to create effects that cannot be achieved by normal means, such as depicting travel to other star systems. They are also used when creating the effect by normal means is prohibitively expensive, such as an enormous explosion. They are also used to enhance previously filmed elements, by adding, removing or enhancing objects within the scene. The [[visual effects artist]] creates these effects, and developes them with the help of the [[visual effects supervisor]]. The task of the Visual effects artist differs frequently, and can range from combining extensive over-the-top special effects with computer [[visual effects]] and CGI animation.

The '''Themed Entertainment Association''' (TEA) is an international non-profit association that represents creators, developers, designers and producers of [[theming|themed entertainment]].  Its mission, as stated in its bylaws, is to facilitate dialogue and communication among its members, to stimulate knowledge and professional growth, and to expand the size, diversity and awareness of the themed [[Show business|entertainment industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeit.com/bylaws.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207011132/http://www.themeit.com/bylaws.pdf|title=Themed Entertainment Association Bylaws|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association|archivedate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year since 2007, the TEA has hosted SATE (Story + Architecture + Technology = Experience), a lecture-based industry conference.&lt;ref name="SATE"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Events-Education/SATE/ TEA SATE conference &amp; SATE Academy Days].

{{Anchor|Founding}}

==Founding==
The TEA was founded in 1991 by Monty Lunde, a former special effects designer for Disney who had gone on to start the special effects company Technifex with his business partner Rock Hall. Lunde was finding it difficult to negotiate contracts with large corporations and wanted to organize small businesses in the industry to share best practices, establish common contracts, and facilitate better dialogue with customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blooloop.com/features/technifex-monty-lunde-tea/ TEA and Fantasy: Technifex President and CEO Monty Lunde].

==Thea Awards==
The TEA annually presents Thea Awards to projects that exemplify the highest standards of excellence and achievement, including individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences in the themed entertainment industry. The Thea Awards began in 1994 with a single honoree: [[Harrison Price|Harrison “Buzz” Price]], the first recipient of the TEA Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livedesignonline.com/business-people-news/thea-confidential Thea Confidential]. Live Design. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; That award is now called the Buzz Price Thea Award for a Lifetime of Outstanding Achievements in his honor.&lt;ref name="About Thea"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Thea-Awards/About-thea/ About the Thea Awards]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second recipient was [[Marty Sklar]] in 1995.

In 1996, the Awards for Outstanding Achievement (AOA) were introduced, and ten were distributed. In the years since, additional special categories of AOA have been created, ensuring a multi-award event.&lt;ref name="About Thea" /&gt; Anyone can nominate a project, but judging is conducted by a committee that includes all past lifetime achievement honorees, one board liaison, and nine members-at-large appointed to three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Thea-Awards/Thea-Committee/ Thea Committee]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Award recipients are announced in November and formally presented the following spring.

'''''Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig''''' is a fortnightly [[radio show]] created and hosted by [[Ezra Koenig]] that began airing on July 12, 2015 on [[Apple Music|Apple Music's]] radio service, [[Beats 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to the first episode of Ezra Koenig’s Time Crisis radio show|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/listen-to-the-first-episode-of-ezra-koenigs-time-crisis-radio-show/|website=Consequence of Sound|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show covers a variety of topics, such as politics, corporate food history, 1970s [[rock music]], as well as frequently analysing the latest in contemporary pop music by contrasting it with music released in another era. In addition to Koenig, a variety of guest hosts have appeared over the show's history, including [[Jonah Hill]], [[Rashida Jones]] and [[Jamie Foxx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ezra Koenig and Jamie Foxx Talk Politics and Pop Music on Beats 1's "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/60910-ezra-koenig-and-jamie-foxx-talk-politics-and-pop-music-on-beats-1s-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Koenig is accompanied by his L.A. co-host, [[Jake Longstreth]], who regularly discusses his love for the "tasteful" palette of rock music, mostly 70s rock, such as [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Ween]] and [[Guided by Voices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hear Ezra Koenig &amp; Azealia Banks Talk Summer Jams On Beats 1 Radio|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1822758/hear-ezra-koenig-azealia-banks-talk-summer-jams-on-beats-1-radio/mp3s/|website=Stereogum|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show airs every two weeks. As of November 04, 2018, 80 episodes have aired. The show is currently airing its fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Crisis on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/curator/time-crisis/993269786|website=W3Util.FB.siteName.iTunesBrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and Segments==
The show follows a general format each episode during its two-hour runtime, usually with listener emails and other discussions in the first half of the show and the ''Top Five on iTunes'' at the episode's conclusion.

===News Discussions===
The most common segment on the call, in which Koenig and his co-hosts discuss the most relevant and obscure news topics of the week, generally relating to politics or current happenings in the world of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Ezra Koenig Impersonate Alex Jones on "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-ezra-koenig-impersonate-alex-jones-on-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ezra Koenig Discusses His Love of Tom Petty’s "Free Fallin’": Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ezra-koenig-discusses-his-love-of-tom-pettys-free-fallin-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate Food History Discussions===
Frequently, Koenig and guests analyse the current landscape of the corporate food industry, as well as looking back on the history of snack foods across the world. In 2016, Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing executive of the [[Frito-Lay]] corporation appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koenig|first1=Ezra|title=today on Time Crisis we have Jennifer Saenz, Chief Marketing Officer of Frito-Lay + @ByYourLogic Chief Marketing Officer of Chapo Trap House|url=https://twitter.com/arze/status/795339285125697536?lang=en|website=@arze|language=en|date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the show has discussed [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] on multiple episodes and their obscure promotions, such as the ''Five Dollar Footlong'' deal. In 2018, the show highly criticised the ''Lady Dorito'' proposition by hosting a ''Lady Dorito's Town Hall'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting to the iTunes Store.|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/station/lady-doritos-town-hall/ra.1352803232|website=itunes.apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring [[Rashida Jones]] and Longstreth's wife and filmmaker, [[Hannah Fidell]].

===''Time Crisis Hotline''===
Koenig regularly takes phone calls and has intimate discussions with notable journalists, political commentators, corporate food professionals and celebrities. Notable calls have included ''Seinfeld'' theme composer, [[Jonathan Wolff (musician)|Jonathan Wolff]], [[Reading Rainbow]] composer, Steve Horelick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig Interviews "Reading Rainbow" Composer and Kid Rock’s Son: Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/vampire-weekends-ezra-koenig-interviews-reading-rainbow-composer-and-kid-rocks-son-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

===User Emails===
This has been a regular segment since the show's third season. Initially, the segment began after a fan located [[Jake Longstreth]]'s personal email. The segment now utilizes the email 8minutecapecod@gmail.com a reference to an episode aired in July 2017 where they joked about the prospect of an 8 minute [[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]] to be played on the next Vampire Weekend tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/timecrisis2000/status/969405707228405760|website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans generally send in questions regarding 1970s music and suggest artists to the hosts that they believe are "tasteful" and fit Longstreth's ideal palette. Another popular topic submitted by fans relates to the corporate food history segment of the show.

===''Jake's Takes''===
A recurring segment in which Longstreth recommends or discusses music, with notable recommendations such as [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Guided by Voices]], [[Ween]], [[Phish]], [[Neil Young]], [[Small Faces]] and more. Occasionally, Longstreth compiles playlists for [[Apple Music]], notably ''The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock, 1959 - 2016 on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/playlist/the-tasteful-palette-of-seventies-rock-1959-2016/pl.9aef90a12f5145a984a1e726072d790c|website=Apple Music|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, ''Jake's New Age and Ambient Playlist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jake’s New Age &amp; Ambient Playlist, 1975 - 2017 on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/playlist/jakes-new-age-ambient-playlist-1975-2017/pl.819ee73517c4465b88f82e5130c3f50c|website=Apple Music|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Five on iTunes''===
Koenig and Longstreth regularly compare and contrast the [[iTunes]] chart from the current week with another music chart from the same week in another year. Notably, the show has regularly jokingly criticized the music of [[Ed Sheeran]], such as his 2017 hit, ''[[Shape of You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen to Ezra Koenig Impersonate Alex Jones on "Time Crisis" {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-ezra-koenig-impersonate-alex-jones-on-time-crisis/|website=pitchfork.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig and Longstreth commonly refer to the song as ''Bed Sheets'', in reference to one of the song's lines. Fan response to this criticism has been overwhelmingly positive, with one particular fan even compiling the discussions into a complete 32-minute compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Crisis: 'Shape of You' compilation - Clyp|url=https://clyp.it/2ycbndsh|website=Clyp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason Statham]] plays Frank Martin in the first three movies, a professional freelance courier driver for hire. Statham himself is an accomplished [[martial artist]], allowing him to do all the combat scenes involving Frank Martin himself. This permits the films' signature Hong Kong-style fight scenes, choreographed by [[Corey Yuen]]. 
[[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[Transporter: The Series|television series]] and [[Ed Skrein]] portrays Frank Martin in the [[The Transporter Refueled|fourth film]], a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]].

===''The Transporter''===
{{Main|The Transporter}}
Frank Martin ([[Jason Statham]]) is a highly skilled driver known only as "The Transporter." He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: "Once the deal is made, it is final", Rule Number 2: "No names", and Rule Number 3: "Never open the package." Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.

===''Transporter 2''===
{{Main|Transporter 2}}
Frank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young "package" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the [[Audi A8 W12]] in this film.

Inspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.

===''Transporter 3''===
{{Main|Transporter 3}}
Frank has been pressured into transporting Valentina ([[Natalya Rudakova]]) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from [[Marseille]] through [[Stuttgart]] and [[Budapest]] until he ends up in [[Odessa]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi ([[François Berléand]]), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured [[Audi A8 W12]] in the film, as well as a [[BMX]] bicycle.

===''The Transporter Refueled''===
{{main|The Transporter Refueled}}
In May 2013, at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]], a new reboot trilogy was announced with [[EuropaCorp]] and [[China]]'s [[Fundamental Films]] co-producing and distributing the titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Transporter' sequels announced at Cannes Film Festival|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a483790/transporter-sequels-announced-at-cannes-film-festival.html|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=digitalspy.co.uk|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cannes 2013: Three New Films In The Transporter Franchise Announced|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=37600|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=empireonline.com|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films will likely be budgeted between $30 million to $40 million each and at least one will be shot in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Transporter trilogy bound for big screen with parts 4 5 and 6 announced|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/05/22/new-transporter-trilogy-bound-for-big-screen-with-parts-4-5-and-6-announced-3805144/|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=metro.co.uk|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luc Besson]] will co-finance, distribute, produce and write all the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sequel Bits: ‘Transformers 4’, ‘Expendables 3’, ‘Transporter 4-6’, ‘The Hobbit’, ‘Anchorman 2’, ‘Pacific Rim 2’|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sequel-bits-transformers-4-expendables-3-transporter-4-6-the-hobbit-anchorman-2-pacific-rim-2/|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=slashfilm.com|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; English actor [[Ed Skrein]] replaced Jason Statham as Frank Martin on the fourth installment of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transporter 4 will star Ed Skrein in Jason Statham role|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/10/transporter-4-ed-skrein-jason-statham-game-of-thrones|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=theguardian.com|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth film, ''[[The Transporter Refueled]]'', was released in the United States on 4 September 2015 with [[Camille Delamarre]] directing.

==Frank Martin==
{{Main
| Frank Martin (Transporter)
}}
'''Frank Martin''' is the [[protagonist]] of the films and television series. He initially serves as a [[reluctant hero]]. He is portrayed as a former [[Special Forces]] operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations "in and out of" [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Sudan]]. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.

In 1923, Universal produced the drama ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', starring [[Lon Chaney]] as [[Quasimodo]]. The production sets were built to evoke 15th-century Paris, including a re-creation of the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] cathedral.

Chaney stars as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] in 1925's horror film, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', based on the [[The Phantom of the Opera|mystery novel]] by [[Gaston Leroux]]. The interior of the [[Opéra Garnier]] was recreated to scale and was used again in the 1943 remake with [[Claude Rains]].

===1930s===

[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'']]

In 1931, [[Bela Lugosi]] starred in Universal's ''Dracula'' and [[Boris Karloff]] in ''Frankenstein''. Actors [[Dwight Frye]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]], who played major supporting roles in both films, made several film appearances in this decade. Make-up artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created several monsters' make-up starting in the 1930s.

''The Mummy'', starring Karloff, was produced in 1932. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on the tales of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]: ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932) starring Lugosi, ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), the latter two of which teamed Lugosi with Karloff. Universal began releasing sequels including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936) and sequels for ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933). The first mainstream werewolf picture, ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (1935) starring [[Henry Hull]], was not a box office triumph despite being revered by audiences today.

The end of Universal’s first run of horror films came in 1936. The monster movies were dropped from the production schedule altogether and would not re-emerge for another three years. In the meantime, a theatre owner revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a resoundingly successful double feature, prompting the studio to re-release the original movies. ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), starring [[Basil Rathbone]], Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi, was filmed as a result of the unexpected resurgence.

===1940s===
During the 1940s, Universal released ''The Wolf Man'' (1941), with [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] The junior Chaney became the studio's leading monster movie actor in the 1940s, just as his father had been two decades earlier, supplanting the 1930s' Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney Jr. physically resembled his father apart from usually being somewhat overweight, which the senior Chaney never was. The studio dropped the "Jr." from the junior Chaney's billing almost immediately to confuse some in the audiences into assuming that this was the same actor.

In 1943, the studio created a remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'', this time starring [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Susanna Foster]] with Claude Rains as the Phantom.

The ''Frankenstein'' and ''Wolf Man'' series continued with ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942), in which Chaney Jr. played Frankenstein's monster and Lugosi reprised his role as Ygor, and ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' (1943) with Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster and Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. ''Son of Dracula'' (1943) featured Chaney Jr. in Lugosi's original role as the Count. The ''Mummy'' series was also continued with ''[[The Mummy's Hand]]'' (1940), ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (both 1944) with Chaney Jr. as the Mummy in the last three films. ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944) and ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945) featured many of the monsters from the studio's previous films. As the decade drew to a close, the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) features Lugosi in only his second film as [[Count Dracula]], alongside Chaney Jr. as [[Larry Talbot]] (the Wolf Man), and [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]].

''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' were re-released as double features in theatres, and were later broadcast in syndication on American television in 1957 as part of the ''[[Shock Theater]]'' package of Universal Monster Movies.&lt;ref name="Okuda"&gt;{{cite book|last = Okuda|first = Ted|authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Yurkiw, Mark |title = Chicago TV Horror Movie Shows: From Shock Theatre to Svengoolie|publisher = Lake Claremont Press|year = 2007|page = 14|isbn = 978-1893121133|quote= The 'Shock!' package was sold in 142 markets.

Universal spent the last half of the decade issuing a number of one-shot monster films.

===Dark Universe===
[[File:Dark Universe official logo.jpg|thumb|242x242px|Official logo of the Dark Universe, shared film universe as released by Universal Pictures]]
Dark Universe is the term given by Universal Pictures to their planned [[cinematic universe]], which will be based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. The studio's first attempt at this universe was with the film ''[[Dracula Untold]]''. Released on October 10, 2014, with [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] in the [[Count Dracula|titular role]], the film was developed prior to plans for a shared universe of horror films. However, it was retooled to be a part of the franchise. The film's mixed financial and critical reception resulted in the film's future status within the franchise becoming uncertain. Since the release of ''Dracula Untold'', the connections to the shared universe have been downplayed. Universal, which had announced plans to reboot [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'' franchise]] in 2012, decided to re-position the new installment as the first film in the series. ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was set to be released in 2017 with [[Alex Kurtzman]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Universal Stakes Out Release Date for Third Monster Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-stakes-release-date-third-890292|accessdate=September 24, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|title=What Universal Must Do To Sell Its Classic Monsters Universe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/07/13/what-universal-must-do-to-sell-its-classic-monsters-universe/#7772cec46b38|accessdate=September 24, 2016|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kurtzman and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] were announced as headlining the Dark Universe, with collaborations from [[David Koepp]] and [[Christopher McQuarrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-1495481404-htmlstory.html|title=Universal debuts its spooky new Dark Universe and its upcoming 'Bride of Frankenstein'|publisher=''LA Times''|author=Woerner, Meredith|date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the crew, Universal announced the casting of [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde]], [[Javier Bardem]] as the [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein Monster]], and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]]. They would join [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Sofia Boutella]], as Nick Morton and Princess Ahmanet / The Mummy. [[Bill Condon]] was announced as the director of the franchise's ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', originally set to be released on February 14, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2423971/its-been-one-year-since-the-dark-universe-was-announced-so-what-happened|title=It's Been One Year Since The Dark Universe Was Announced, So What Happened?|publisher=Cinema Blend|author=Holmes, Adam|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though various sources claimed that Evans' character might have at least a cameo in ''The Mummy'' or any of the upcoming films in the universe, Kurtzman denied these claims, stating that he considered the film to not be a part of the ''Dark Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trumbore |first=Dave |date=December 4, 2016 |title='The Mummy': Alex Kurtzman Confirms 'Dracula Untold' Is Not Canon, Teases Jekyll's Role |url=http://collider.com/the-mummy-universal-monsters-shared-universe/#dracula-untold |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rebooted versions of their characters were announced to have films in development as well including: the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]], the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]], the [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]], and [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]].

'''Wetpaint''' is an internet company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Function(X). Founded in 2005, Wetpaint both publishes the website Wetpaint Entertainment, focused on entertainment news, and develops a proprietary technology platform, the Social Distribution System, that is used to provide analytics for its own website as well as other online publishers'. Wetpaint began as a [[wiki farm]], hosting [[wiki]]s using its own proprietary software, before moving into hosting of professional content in 2010. Wetpaint's wiki-hosting component was spun off completely in 2013 after being purchased by Wikifoundry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = http://www.wikifoundrycentral.com/thread/5139827/Wet+Paint+Wiki | title = Wet Paint Wiki - WikiFoundry Central | date = 2013-09-01 | access-date = 2017-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Wetpaint was originally called Wikisphere, and begun as a [[wiki farm]], hosting [[wiki]]s using proprietary software. It was co-founded in October 2005 by Ben Elowitz, who had previously co-founded the online jewelry retailer [[Blue Nile Inc.]] In December 2005, the company and site were renamed to Wetpaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blog.seattlepi.com/venture/archives/100675.asp | title = Startup Wikisphere changes its name to Wetpaint | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = 2005-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the company received its initial A round of venture capital funding of USD5.25 million from Trinity Ventures and Frazier Technology Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/business/246734_wiki02.html | title = Startup Wikisphere raises $5.25 million in 1st round | publisher = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = 2005-11-02 | first1=John | last1=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetpaint closed a USD9.5 million 'B' round of funding in January 2007, adding [[Accel Partners]] to the list of investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=21412&amp;hed=Wiki+Providers+Score+Funding&amp;sector=Industries&amp;subsector=InternetAndServices | title = Wiki Providers Score Funding | publisher = [[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]] | date = 2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetpaint closed a Series C round of venture capital funding of USD25 million in May 2008. Investors included Accel Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Frazier Technology Ventures.

Wetpaint was named by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as one of the 50 Best Websites of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1633488_1633608_1633634,00.html | title = Wetpaint.com - 50 Best Websites 2007 | publisher = [[Time Magazine]] | date = 2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Wetpaint added [[social networking]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wetpaint Goes Social | url = http://press.wetpaint.com/page/Wetpaint+Goes+Social | work = press release | publisher = Wetpaint | date = 2008-03-10 | accessdate = 2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Wetpaint laid off 15 of their 56 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/07/27/seattle-layoff-update-targeted-genetics-wetpaint-google-and-others-cut-staff/ | title = Seattle Layoff Update:Targeted Genetics, Wetpaint, Google, and Others Cut Staff | publisher = xconomy | date = 2009-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 9 employees, including co-founders Kevin Flaherty and Alex Berg, were laid off in December.&lt;ref name="cuts staff"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/12/exclusive_wetpaint_cuts_staff_changes_focus_to_online_publishing.html | title = Exclusive: Wetpaint cuts staff, changes focus to publishing | publisher = John Cook, TechFlash | date = 2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also decided to refocus the website on professionally created content. Both steps were taken as a result of declining online ad revenue.&lt;ref name="cuts staff" /&gt;

During late 2009, Wetpaint re-launched its main homepage, at wetpaint.com, as the Wetpaint Entertainment platform, a set of new online TV fan destination sites, geared toward the female 18-34 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10852711/wetpaint-launches-online-tv-fan-destination-with-coverage-of-this-falls-most-anticipated-tv-programs.html Wetpaint Launches Online TV Fan Destination With Coverage Of This Fall's Most Anticipated TV Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; The wiki farm was renamed "Wikis by Wetpaint", and was moved to the domain wetpaintcentral.com.

In December 2010, the company announced the Wetpaint Social Distribution System.&lt;ref name="prweb.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wetpaint Entertainment Rapidly Becomes a Leading Online Entertainment News Source Due to Wetpaint’s Proprietary Social Distribution System|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/12/prweb9044567.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Wetpaint was acquired by Viggle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20131216-907355.html | title = Viggle Acquires Wetpaint | publisher = Press Release | date = 2013-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an entertainment rewards platform, which was shortly renamed to its former name, Function(X).
