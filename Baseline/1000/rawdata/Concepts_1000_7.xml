{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A priori'' and ''a posteriori''}}
The [[Latin]] phrases '''''a priori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the earlier") and '''''a posteriori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the later") are [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[term of art|terms of art]] popularized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (first published in 1781, second edition in 1787), one of the most influential works in the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Birdarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham Bird |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=439 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in their Latin forms they appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|BCE}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

These terms are used with respect to reasoning ([[epistemology]]) to distinguish "necessary conclusions from first premises" (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from "conclusions based on [[sense observation]]" which must follow it. Thus, the two kinds of [[knowledge]], [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]], or [[argument]], may be glossed:

*''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of [[experience]], as with [[mathematics]] (3 + 2 = 5), [[tautology (grammar)|tautologies]] ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[pure reason]] (e.g., [[Ontological argument|ontological proofs]]).{{refn|[[Galen Strawson]] has stated that an ''a priori'' argument is one in which "you can see that it is [[Truth|true]] just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref name="Galen Strawson interviewed by Tamler Sommers"&gt;{{harvnb|Sommers|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
*[[A posteriori knowledge|''A posteriori'' knowledge]] or justification depends on [[experience]] or [[empirical evidence]], as with most aspects of [[science]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal knowledge]].

There are many points of view on these two types of knowledge, and their relationship gives rise to one of the oldest problems in [[modern philosophy]].

The terms ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' are primarily used as [[adjective]]s to modify the [[noun]] "knowledge" (for example, "''a priori'' knowledge"). However, "''a priori''" is sometimes used to modify other nouns, such as "truth". Philosophers also may use "apriority" and "aprioricity" as nouns to refer (approximately) to the quality of being "''a priori''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

Although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labeled two separate epistemological notions. See also the related distinctions: [[deductive reasoning|deductive]]/[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|necessary/contingent]].

==Examples==
The intuitive distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge (or justification) is best seen via examples, as below:

;''A priori''
:Consider the proposition, "If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days."  This is something that one knows ''a priori'', because it expresses a statement that one ''can'' derive by reason alone. 
;''A posteriori''
:Compare this with the [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] expressed by the sentence, "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936."  This is something that (if true) one must come to know ''a posteriori'', because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.

==Analyticity and necessity==
===Relation to the analytic-synthetic===
{{details|Analytic-synthetic distinction}}

Several philosophers reacting to Kant sought to explain ''a priori'' knowledge without appealing to, as [[Paul Boghossian]] (MD) explains, "a special faculty ... that has never been described in satisfactory terms."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Boghossian|2003|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, popular among the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the "analytic explanation of the a priori."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996" /&gt; The distinction between [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic and synthetic propositions]] was first introduced by Kant. While Kant's original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of the distinction primarily involves, as the American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] put it, the notions of "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact."&lt;ref name=Q21&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone, while ''a posteriori analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning ''and'' certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the ''a priori'', all ''a priori'' knowledge is analytic; so ''a priori'' knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition, since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question.  In short, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity.

However, the analytic explanation of ''a priori'' knowledge has undergone several criticisms.  Most notably, Quine argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate. Quine states: "But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the soundness of Quine's critique is highly disputed, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the ''a priori'' in terms of the analytic.

===Relation to the necessary and contingent===
The metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge. A proposition that is ''[[Modal logic|necessarily true]]'' is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, it is said to be true in every [[possible world]]). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is ''contingently true'' is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is ''not'' true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known ''a priori'', because "[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, "[[logical positivism|Positivism]], in particular, took it for granted that ''a priori'' truths must be necessary...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fodor|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic propositions]] were largely taken to be "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact",&lt;ref name=Q21/&gt; while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the [[truth-value]] of synthetic propositions.

Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. The American philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), for example, provided strong arguments against this position.  Kripke argued that there are necessary ''a posteriori'' truths, such as the proposition that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (if it is true). According to Kripke, this statement is necessarily true (since water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary) and ''a posteriori'' (since it is known only through empirical investigation). Following such considerations of Kripke and others (such as [[Hilary Putnam]]), philosophers tend to distinguish more clearly the notion of aprioricity from that of necessity and analyticity.

Kripke's definitions of these terms, however, diverge in subtle ways from those of Kant. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and ''a priori'' would, according to Stephen Palmquist, best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it "analytic a posteriori".{{refn|group=nb |In this pair of articles, Stephen Palmquist demonstrates that the context often determines how a particular proposition should be classified. A proposition that is synthetic ''a posteriori'' in one context might be analytic ''a priori'' in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmquist|1987|pp=269, 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Aaron Sloman]] presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical and necessary/contingent) in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=A.|date=1965-10-01|title='Necessary', 'a priori' and 'analytic'|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/26.1.12|journal=Analysis|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=12–16|doi=10.1093/analys/26.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It did not assume "possible world semantics" for the third distinction, merely that some part of ''this'' world might have been different.

Thus, the relationship between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity is not easy to discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the ''a priori''/''a posteriori'' distinction is [[epistemology|epistemological]], the analytic/synthetic distinction is [[linguistics|linguistic]], and the necessary/contingent distinction is [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early uses===
The phrases "''a priori''" and "''a posteriori''" are [[Latin]] for "from what comes before" and "from what comes later" (or, less literally, "from first principles, before experience" and "after experience"). They appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of ''a priori'' knowledge (though not called by that name) is [[Plato]]'s [[Innatism|theory of recollection]], related in the  dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' (380&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), according to which something like ''a priori'' knowledge is knowledge inherent, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] in the human mind.

[[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], a 14th-century logician, wrote on both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. W. Leibniz]] introduced a distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' criteria for the possibility of a notion in his (1684) short treatise "Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' arguments for the existence of God appear in his ''[[Monadology]]'' (1714).&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[George Berkeley]] outlined the distinction in his 1710 work ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (para. XXI).

===Immanuel Kant===
The 18th-century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1781) advocated a blend of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] theories. Kant says, "Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises [is caused by] from experience"&lt;ref name="kant_1781"&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1781|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, ''a priori'' cognition is [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], or based on the ''form'' of all possible experience, while ''a posteriori'' cognition is empirical, based on the ''content'' of experience. Kant states, "[…] it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving merely the ''occasion'' [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect]."&lt;ref name="kant_1781"/&gt; Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. And unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the [[condition of possibility|conditions of possible experience]]. These ''a priori'', or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that ''a priori'' intuitions can be "triggered" by experience). 

Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a [[transcendental logic]] with which to consider the deduction of the ''a priori'' in its pure form. [[Space]], [[time]] and [[causality]] are considered pure ''a priori'' intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure ''a priori'' intuitions are established via his [[transcendental aesthetic]] and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these ''a priori'' forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.&amp;nbsp;e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental deduction]] and it is the central argument of his major work, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the ''a priori'', this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of [[subjectivity]],  what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.

===Johann Fichte===
After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of [[German Idealism]]. One of these philosophers was [[Johann Fichte]]. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], accused him of rejecting the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge:

{{Quote|... Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">The '''Anna Karenina principle''' states that a deficiency in any [[Limiting factor|one of a number of factors]] dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.

The name of the principle derives from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words: in order to be happy, a family must be successful on ''each and every one'' of ''a'' ''range'' of criteria e.g.: sexual attraction, money issues, parenting, religion, in-laws. Failure on only ''one'' of these counts leads to ''un''happiness. Thus there are more ways for a family to be unhappy than happy.

In [[statistics]], the term ''Anna Karenina principle'' is used to describe [[Statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the [[null hypothesis]] and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied.

==Examples==

===Failed domestication===
The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, J. |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined:

*'''Diet''' – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates.
*'''Growth rate''' – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps 12 years for their herd to reach adult size.
*'''Captive breeding''' – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having [[mating]] rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases.
*'''Disposition''' – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The [[zebra]] is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent.
*'''Tendency to panic''' – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. [[Deer]] in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. Horses, however, immediately thrived from the time they were introduced to North America in the 16th century.
*'''Social structure''' – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well defined [[social hierarchy]] is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another.

==Ecological risk assessment==
{{See also|Liebig's law of the minimum}}

Moore describes applications of the ''Anna Karenina principle'' in [[ecology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful ecological risk assessments are all alike; every unsuccessful ecological risk assessment fails in its own way. Tolstoy posited a similar analogy in his novel Anna Karenina : "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." By that, Tolstoy meant that for a marriage to be happy, it had to succeed in several key aspects. Failure on even one of these aspects, and the marriage is doomed . . . the Anna Karenina principle also applies to ecological risk assessments involving multiple stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dwayne R.J.|title=The Principle Applied to Ecological Risk Assessments of Multiple Stressors|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal|date=March 2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.1080/20018091094349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aristotle's version==

Much earlier, ''[[Aristotle]]'' states the same principle in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 2):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html Nicomachean Ethics], Translated by [[W. D. Ross]], Oxford University Press, Oxford; Revised edition (11 Jun 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult – to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue; For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Order in chaos of maladaptation==
Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By studying the dynamics of correlation and variance in many systems facing external, or environmental, factors, we can typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, predict when one might occur, as correlation between individuals increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) goes up.... '''All well-adapted systems are alike, all non-adapted systems experience maladaptation in their own way,... But in the chaos of maladaptation, there is an order'''. It seems, paradoxically, that as systems become more different they actually become more correlated within limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-public/anna-karenina-principle-explains-bodily-stress-and-stockmarket-crashes Anna Karenina principle explains bodily stress and stockmarket crashes], University of Leicester, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This effect is proved for many systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=Alexander N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=Elena V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=Tatiana A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003_Correlations_Risk_and_Crisis_From_Physiology_to_Finance|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of [[social stress]] in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;Rybnikov, S.R.; Rybnikova, N.A.; Portnov, B.A. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?] Psychology &amp; Developing Societies 29(1):98-123· March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mathematical backgrounds==
[[Vladimir Arnold]] in his book ''Catastrophe Theory'' describes "The Principle of Fragility of Good Things" which in a sense supplements the Principle of Anna Karenina: good systems must meet simultaneously a number of requirements; therefore, they are more fragile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... for systems belonging to the singular part of the stability boundary a small change of the parameters is more likely to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region. This is a manifestation of a general principle stating that all good things (e.g. stability) are more fragile than bad things. It seems that in good situations a number of requirements must hold simultaneously, while to call a situation bad even one failure suffices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=V. I.|title=Catastrophe Theory|date=September 1992 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-54811-4 |edition=3rd Rev Exp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catastrophe_theory.html?id=GQoQyqia45gC |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Apollo_Tityos_Met_08.258.21.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo]] killing [[Tityos]]. Lower tier, side A of an Attic red-figure calyx-krater. Attributed to the Nekyia Painter]] 

The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

===Albert Szent-Györgyi===
[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte''''' (''''''Archive for Conceptual History'''''') is a German [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]. It was founded by [[Erich Rothacker]], and is published by Christian Bermes, Ulrich Dierse and Michael Erler. The editor is Annika Hand.

== Themes ==

The journal publishes works on concepts of the history of philosophy and sciences, both from the European and from non-European traditions, on mythological and religious concepts, and on concepts of common parlance which have a characteristic significance for a special era or culture. The journal also embraces articles on revealing metaphors, on problems at translating concepts, as well as on theory and criticism of the method of conceptual history.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the terminology evolved. 
==Argument==
An '''[[argument]]''', more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|''valid'']] [[if and only if]] its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument ''per se''; such must come from the outside. 

Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word ''constituent'' may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of [[truth-bearer]]: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.

==Deduction==
A '''deduction''' is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a [[deductive argument]]. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as [[Venn diagrams]] and other graphic procedures have been proposed.

==Proof==
A '''[[Formal proof|proof]]''' is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is a deduction that might use several premises — [[axiom]]s, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As [[Alfred Tarski]] famously emphasized in accord with [[Aristotle]], truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.
==Comparison==
Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. 
Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.
Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.
==Context==
Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.[[Willard Van Orman Quine| Quine]] devotes the first chapter of ''Philosophy of Logic'' to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;WILLARD QUINE, ''Philosophy of logic'', Harvard, 1970/1986. &lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not even been able to agree on what [[Aristotle]] took as constituents.&lt;ref&gt; JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300–1. &lt;/ref&gt;


Argument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the ''consequence-deducibility'' distinction and the ''truth-and-consequence conception of proof''.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.

Logician [[Alonzo Church]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church
  |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic
  |publisher=Princeton University Press
  |year=1956
|isbn=9780691029061}}&lt;/ref&gt; never used the word ''argument'' in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun ''deduction'' for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.

The absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed [[Plato]]nistic logicism. Following [[Michael Dummett|Dummett's]] insightful remarks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], which — ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' — apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.

In [[ontology]], the different kinds or ways of [[being]] are called '''categories of being'''; or simply '''categories'''. To investigate the categories of being is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest [[class (philosophy)|class]]es of entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an '''ontological distinction'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early development==
The process of abstraction required to discover the number and names of the categories has been undertaken by many philosophers since [[Aristotle]] and involves the careful inspection of each concept to ensure that there is no higher category or categories under which that concept could be subsumed. The [[Scholasticism|scholars]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed Aristotle's ideas, firstly, for example by [[Gilbert de la Porrée|Gilbert of Poitiers]], dividing Aristotle's ten categories into two sets, primary and secondary, according to whether they inhere in the subject or not:
*Primary categories: Substance, Relation, Quantity and Quality
*Secondary categories: Place, Time, Situation, Condition, Action, Passion&lt;ref&gt;Reese W.L. ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion'' (Harvester Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, following [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]’s likening of the classificatory hierarchy to a [[Porphyrian tree|tree]], they concluded that the major classes could be subdivided to form subclasses, for example, [[Substance theory|Substance]] could be divided into [[Genus]] and Species, and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] could be subdivided into [[Property (philosophy)|Property]] and Accident, depending on whether the property was necessary or contingent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. cf Evangelou C. ''Aristotle’s Categories and Porphyry'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative line of development was taken by [[Plotinus]] in the second century who by a process of abstraction reduced Aristotle’s list of ten categories to five: Substance, Relation, Quantity, Motion and Quality.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads'' (tr. Mackenna S. &amp; Page B.S., The Medici Society, London, 1930) VI.3.3&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus further suggested that the latter three categories of his list, namely Quantity, Motion and Quality correspond to three different kinds of relation and that these three categories could therefore be subsumed under the category of Relation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. VI.3.21&lt;/ref&gt; This was to lead to the supposition that there were only two categories at the top of the hierarchical tree, namely Substance and Relation, and if relations only exist in the mind as many supposed, to the two highest categories, Mind and Matter, reflected most clearly in the dualism of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Descartes R. ''The Philosophical Works of Descartes'' (tr. Haldane E. &amp; Ross G., Dover, New York, 1911) Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern development==
An alternative conclusion however began to be formulated in the eighteenth century by [[Immanuel Kant]] who realised that we can say nothing about [[Substance theory|Substance]] except through the relation of the subject to other things.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; In the sentence "This is a house" the substantive subject "house" only gains meaning in relation to human use patterns or to other similar houses. The category of Substance disappears from [[Category (Kant)|Kant's tables]], and under the heading of Relation, Kant lists ''inter alia'' the three relationship types of Disjunction, Causality and Inherence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; The three older concepts of Quantity, Motion and Quality, as [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] discovered, could be subsumed under these three broader headings in that [[Quantity]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]; Motion relates to the subject through the relation of [[Causality]]; and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Inherence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of three continued to play an important part in the nineteenth century development of the categories, most notably in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel's]] extensive tabulation of categories,&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co, London, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Categories (Peirce)|C.S. Peirce's categories]] set out in his work on the logic of relations. One of Peirce's contributions was to call the three primary categories Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt; which both emphasises their general nature, and avoids the confusion of having the same name for both the category itself and for a concept within that category.

In a separate development, and building on the notion of primary and secondary categories introduced by the Scholastics, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] introduced the idea that secondary or "derivative" categories could be derived from the primary categories through the combination of one primary category with another.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.3'' p.116&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in the formation of three secondary categories: the first, "Community" was an example that Kant gave of such a derivative category; the second, "[[Linguistic modality|Modality]]", introduced by Kant, was a term which Hegel, in developing Kant's dialectical method, showed could also be seen as a derivative category;&lt;ref&gt;Hegel G.W.F. ''Logic'' (tr. Wallace W., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975) pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt; and the third, "Spirit" or "Will" were terms that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''On the Four-Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''  1813 (tr. Payne E., La Salle, Illinois, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; were developing separately for use in their own systems. [[Karl Jaspers]] in the twentieth century, in his development of existential categories, brought the three together, allowing for differences in terminology, as Substantiality, Communication and Will.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K. ''Philosophy'' 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by [[Peter Mark Roget]] to form the six headings of his [[Roget's Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Roget P.M. ''Roget’s Thesaurus: The Everyman Edition'' 1952 (Pan Books, London, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century development==
In the twentieth century the primacy of the division between the subjective and the objective, or between mind and matter, was disputed by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''The Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1921) pp.10,23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gilbert Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''The Concept of Mind''  (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1949) pp.17ff&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy began to move away from the metaphysics of categorisation towards the linguistic problem of trying to differentiate between, and define, the words being used. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]’s conclusion was that there were no clear definitions which we can give to words and categories but only a "halo" or "corona"&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'' 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) pp.14,181&lt;/ref&gt; of related meanings radiating around each term. Gilbert Ryle thought the problem could be seen in terms of dealing with "a galaxy of ideas" rather than a single idea, and suggested that [[category mistake]]s are made when a concept (e.g. "university"), understood as falling under one category (e.g. abstract idea), is used as though it falls under another (e.g. physical object).&lt;ref&gt;Ryle G. ''Collected Papers'' (Hutchinson, London, 1971) Vol.II: ''Philosophical Arguments'' 1945, pp.201,202&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the visual analogies being used, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.1'' pp.52,82,106&lt;/ref&gt; just like [[Plotinus]] earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.5.5&lt;/ref&gt; likened the terms of propositions to points, and the relations between the terms to lines. Peirce, taking this further, talked of univalent, bivalent and trivalent relations linking predicates to their subject and it is just the number and types of relation linking subject and predicate that determine the category into which a predicate might fall.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' Vol I pp.159,176&lt;/ref&gt; Primary categories contain concepts where there is one dominant kind of relation to the subject. Secondary categories contain concepts where there are two dominant kinds of relation. Examples of the latter were given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in his two propositions "the house is on the creek" where the two dominant relations are spatial location (Disjunction) and cultural association (Inherence), and "the house is eighteenth century" where the two relations are temporal location (Causality) and cultural quality (Inherence).&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.4'' pp.62,187&lt;/ref&gt; A third example may be inferred from Kant in the proposition "the house is impressive or [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]" where the two relations are spatial or mathematical disposition (Disjunction) and dynamic or motive power (Causality).&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Judgement'' 1790 (tr. Meredith J.C., Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952) p.94ff&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.25'' pp.36,152&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the analogy of [[colour theory]] in order to illustrate the shades of meanings of words. Primary categories, like primary colours, are analytical representing the furthest we can go in terms of analysis and abstraction and include Quantity, Motion and Quality. Secondary categories, like secondary colours, are synthetic and include concepts such as Substance, Community and Spirit.

==Aristotle==
{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
One of [[Aristotle]]’s early interests lay in the classification of the natural world, how for example the genus "animal" could be first divided into "two-footed animal" and then into "wingless, two-footed animal".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1075a&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that the distinctions were being made according to the qualities the animal possesses, the quantity of its parts and the kind of motion that it exhibits. To fully complete the proposition "this animal is…" Aristotle stated in his work on the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] that there were ten kinds of predicate where...

"…each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.2''&lt;/ref&gt;

He realised that predicates could be simple or complex. The simple kinds consist of a subject and a predicate linked together by the "categorical" or inherent type of relation. For Aristotle the more complex kinds were limited to propositions where the predicate is compounded of two of the above categories for example "this is a horse running". More complex kinds of proposition were only discovered after Aristotle by the Stoic, [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the "hypothetical" and "disjunctive" types of [[syllogism]] and these were terms which were to be developed through the [[Scholasticism|Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain (''alias'' John XXI) ''Summulae Logicales''&lt;/ref&gt; and were to reappear in [[Category (Kant)|Kant's system of categories]].

''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E. M. Edghill]].

==Plotinus==
[[Plotinus]] in writing his ''[[Enneads]]'' around AD 250 recorded that "philosophy at a very early age investigated the number and character of the existents… some found ten, others less…. to some the genera were the first principles, to others only a generic classification of existents".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; He realised that some categories were reducible to others saying "why are not Beauty, Goodness and the virtues, Knowledge and Intelligence included among the primary genera?"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' VI.2.17&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that such [[Transcendentals|transcendental categories]] and even the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]] were in some way posterior to the three [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] categories first recorded in Plato's dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and which comprised the following three coupled terms: 
*Unity/Plurality
*Motion/Stability
*Identity/Difference&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' (tr. Jowett B., ''The Dialogues of Plato'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1875) p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] called these "the hearth of reality"&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.9'' Op.cit.1.4&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from them not only the three categories of Quantity, Motion and Quality but also what came to be known as "the three moments of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic world process]]":
*First, there existed the "One", and his view that "the origin of things is a contemplation"
*The Second "is certainly an activity… a secondary phase… life streaming from life… energy running through the universe"
*The Third is some kind of Intelligence concerning which he wrote "Activity is prior to Intellection… and self knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' III.8.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus likened the three to the centre, the radii and the circumference of a circle, and clearly thought that the principles underlying the categories were the first principles of creation. "From a single root all being multiplies". Similar ideas were to be introduced into Early Christian thought by, for example, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] who summed it up saying "Therefore Unity, having from all eternity arrived by motion at duality, came to rest in [[trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson A.E. (ed.) ''Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation'' (Longmans, London, 1928) pp.241-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kant==

In the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] are part of our own mental structure and consist of a set of ''a priori'' concepts through which we interpret the world around us.&lt;ref&gt;	''Op.cit.3'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts correspond to twelve logical functions of the understanding which we use to make judgements and there are therefore two tables given in the ''Critique'', one of the Judgements and a corresponding one for the [[Category (Kant)|Categories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, the logical function behind our reasoning from ground to consequence (based on the [[Hypothetical syllogism|Hypothetical relation]]) underlies our understanding of the world in terms of cause and effect (the [[Causality|Causal relation]]). In each table the number twelve arises from, firstly, an initial division into two: the Mathematical and the Dynamical; a second division of each of these headings into a further two: Quantity and Quality, and Relation and Modality respectively; and, thirdly, each of these then divides into a further three subheadings as follows.

[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Criticism of Kant's system]] followed, firstly, by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who amongst other things was unhappy with the term "Community", and declared that the tables "do open violence to truth, treating it as nature was treated by old-fashioned gardeners",&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne A., Dover Publications, London, New York, 1966) p.430&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, by [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T.Stace]] who in his book ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' suggested that in order to make Kant's structure completely symmetrical a third category would need to be added to the Mathematical and the Dynamical.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.15'' p.222&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, Hegel was to do with his category of Notion.

==Hegel==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812) attempted to provide a more comprehensive system of categories than Kant and developed a structure that was almost entirely triadic.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; So important were the categories to Hegel that he claimed "the first principle of the world, the Absolute, is a system of categories… the categories must be the reason of which the world is a consequent".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.63,65&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his own logical method of combination, later to be called the [[Dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]], of arguing from thesis through antithesis to synthesis, he arrived, as shown in W.T.Stace's work cited, at a hierarchy of some 270 categories. The three very highest categories were Logic, Nature and Spirit. The three highest categories of Logic, however, he called Being, Essence and Notion which he explained as follows:
*[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Being]] was differentiated from Nothing by containing with it the concept of the "Other", an initial internal division that can be compared with Kant's category of Disjunction. Stace called the category of Being the sphere of common sense containing concepts such as consciousness, sensation, quantity, quality and measure.
*[[Essence]]. The "Other" separates itself from the "One" by a kind of motion, reflected in Hegel's first synthesis of "[[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]]". For Stace this category represented the sphere of science containing within it firstly, the thing, its form and properties; secondly, cause, effect and reciprocity, and thirdly, the principles of classification, identity and difference. 
*[[Notion (philosophy)|Notion]]. Having passed over into the "Other" there is an almost [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic return]] into a higher unity that in embracing the "One" and the "Other" enables them to be considered together through their inherent qualities. This according to [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]] is the sphere of philosophy proper where we find not only the three types of logical proposition: Disjunctive, Hypothetical and Categorical but also the three transcendental concepts of [[Transcendentals|Beauty, Goodness and Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.18'' pp.124ff&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] category that corresponded with Notion was that of Idea, which in his "''Four-Fold Root of Sufficient Reason''" he complemented with the category of the Will.&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.20''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his major work was "[[The World as Will and Representation|The World as Will and Idea]]". The two other complementary categories, reflecting one of Hegel's initial divisions, were those of Being and Becoming. At around the same time, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was developing his colour theories in the ''[[Theory of Colours|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810, and introduced similar principles of combination and complementation, symbolising, for Goethe, "the primordial relations which belong both to nature and vision".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe J.W. von, ''The Theory of Colours'' (tr. Eastlake C.L., MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1970) p.350&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' accordingly asks us to see his system not as a tree but as a circle.

==Peirce==

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant and Hegel closely, and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness]], which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings. Like Hegel, C.S.Peirce attempted to develop a system of categories from a single indisputable principle, in Peirce's case the notion that in the first instance he could only be aware of his own ideas. 
	"It seems that the true categories of consciousness are first, feeling… second, a sense of resistance… and third, synthetic consciousness, or thought".&lt;ref&gt;''Op.cit.5'' p.200, cf Locke&lt;/ref&gt;
	Elsewhere he called the three primary categories: [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], Reaction and [[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]], and even [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness]], saying, "perhaps it is not right to call these categories conceptions, they are so intangible that they are rather tones or tints upon conceptions":&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.179&lt;/ref&gt;     
*Firstness ([[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]): "The first is predominant in feeling… we must think of a quality without parts, e.g. the colour of magenta… When I say it is a quality I do not mean that it "inheres" in a subject… The whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling, as truly as the whole of space is made up of points, or the whole of time by instants".
*Secondness (Reaction): "This is present even in such a rudimentary fragment of experience as a simple feeling… an action and reaction between our soul and the stimulus… The idea of second is predominant in the ideas of causation and of statical force… the real is active; we acknowledge it by calling it the actual".
*Thirdness ([[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]]): "Thirdness is essentially of a general nature… ideas in which thirdness predominate [include] the idea of a sign or representation… Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning… the idea of meaning is irreducible to those of quality and reaction… synthetical consciousness is the consciousness of a third or medium".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' pp.148-179&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peirce's three categories correspond to the three concepts of relation given in Kant's tables, the sequence is now reversed and follows that given by [[Science of Logic|Hegel]], and indeed before Hegel of the three moments of the world-process given by [[Neoplatonism|Plotinus]]. Later, Peirce gave a mathematical reason for there being three categories in that although monadic, dyadic and triadic nodes are irreducible, every node of a higher valency is reducible to a "compound of triadic relations".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' p.176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was developing "semiology" in France just as Peirce was developing "semiotics" in the US, likened each term of a proposition to "the centre of a constellation, the point where other coordinate terms, the sum of which is indefinite, converge".&lt;ref&gt;Saussure F. de,''Course in General Linguistics'' 1916 (tr. Harris R., Duckworth, London, 1983) p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

For [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a "[[category mistake]]") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.

Contemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G. Bennett]] (The Dramatic Universe, 4 vols., 1956–65), [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (1974), [[Reinhardt Grossmann]] (1983, 1992), Johansson (1989), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994), [[Roderick Chisholm]] (1996), [[Barry Smith (ontologist)]] (2003), and [[Jonathan Lowe]] (2006).

'''Conceptual Design''' is an early phase of the design process, in which the broad outlines of function and form of something are articulated. It includes the design of interactions, experiences, processes and strategies. It involves an understanding of people's needs - and how to meet them with products, services, &amp; processes. Common artifacts of conceptual design are concept sketches and models.

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building?

Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Tajalli |first2=Hassan |title=Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship |work=Journal of Public Affairs Education |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=313–334 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3967 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum2003"&gt;{{citation |last=Baum |first=K. |year=2003 |chapter=Assessing Group Conflict: Understanding the Line-Staff Relationship in Fire Service |title=Handbook of Conflict Management |editor-first1=W. |editor-last1=Pammer |editor-first2=J. |editor-last2=Killian |location=New York |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |pages=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |year=2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit |title=Tools for Excellent Papers: 2014 ASPA Student Summit |publisher=[[Texas State University]] |location=[[Washington D.C.]]}} Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint depicts the connection between football and conceptual frameworks in the context of a large graduate student paper. The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Whetsell |first2=Travis |year=2017 |chapter=Public Administration Methodology: A Pragmatic Perspective |editor-last1=Raadshelders |editor-first1=Jos |editor-last2=Stillman |editor-first2=Richard |title=Foundations of Public Administration |pages=75–92 |publisher=Melvin and Leigh |isbn=978-0-9973-0842-6 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311511761_Public_Administration_Methodology_A_Pragmatic_Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and line up with a research purpose in the following ways:
* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]]. (1996) ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conceptual model''' is a representation of a system, made of the composition of [[concept]]s which are used to help people [[knowledge|know]], [[understanding|understand]], or [[simulation|simulate]] a subject the model represents. It is also a set of concepts. Some [[physical model|models]] are [[physical object]]s; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents.

The term ''conceptual model'' may be used to refer to models which are formed after a [[wikt:concept#Noun|conceptualization]] or [[generalization]] process.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social. [[Semantics|Semantic]] studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience.

== Overview ==
=== Models of concepts and models that are conceptual ===
The term ''conceptual model'' is normal. It could mean "a model of concept" or it could mean "a model that is conceptual." A distinction can be made between ''what models are'' and ''what models are made of''. With the exception of iconic models, such as a scale model of [[Winchester Cathedral]], most models are concepts. But they are, mostly, intended to be models of real world states of affairs. The value of a model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to a past, present, future, actual or potential state of affairs. A model of a concept is quite different because in order to be a good model it need not have this real world correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Frank Hutson (January 1992) [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Cause,_Effect,_Efficiency_%26_Soft_Systems_Models Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models] Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. With revisions and additions it was published in the ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'' (1993) 44(4), pp. 149–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In artificial intelligence conceptual models and [[conceptual graphs]] are used for building [[expert systems]] and [[knowledge-based systems]]; here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true.

=== Type and scope of conceptual models ===
Conceptual models (models that are conceptual) range in type from the more concrete, such as the [[mental image]] of a familiar physical object, to the formal generality and abstractness of [[mathematical model]]s which do not appear to the mind as an image. Conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent. A model may, for instance, represent a single thing (e.g. the ''Statue of Liberty''), whole classes of things (e.g. ''the electron''), and even very vast domains of subject matter such as ''the physical universe.'' The variety and scope of conceptual models is due to then variety of purposes had by the people using them.
Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication."&lt;ref name="Mylopoulos"&gt;{{cite book | first =  J. | last = Mylopoulos | author-link=John Mylopoulos|chapter = Conceptual modeling and Telos1 | editor1-first = P. | editor1-last = Loucopoulos | editor2-first = R | editor2-last = Zicari | title = Conceptual Modeling, Databases, and Case An integrated view of information systems development | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | citeseerx = 10.1.1.83.3647 | pages = 49–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental objectives ===
A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents. Also, a conceptual model must be developed in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the models users. A conceptual model, when implemented properly, should satisfy four fundamental objectives.&lt;ref name="Kung and Solveberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=20143.20149 |title=C.H. Kung, A. Solvberg, Activity Modeling and Behavior Modeling, In: T. Ollie, H. Sol, A. Verrjin-Stuart, Proceedings of the IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on comparative review of information systems design methodologies: improving the practice.

# Enhance an individual's understanding of the representative system
# Facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders
# Provide a point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications
# Document the system for future reference and provide a means for collaboration

The conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle. Figure 1&lt;ref name="Sokolowski"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sokolowski |editor1-first=John A. |editor2-last=Banks |editor2-first=Catherine M. |date=2010 |title=Modeling and Simulation Fundamentals: Theoretical Underpinnings and Practical Domains |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470486740 |oclc=436945978 |doi=10.1002/9780470590621}}&lt;/ref&gt; below, depicts the role of the conceptual model in a typical system development scheme. It is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed, the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly, giving way to future problems or system shortfalls. These failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to; lack of user input, incomplete or unclear requirements, and changing requirements. Those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling. The importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives/techniques.

== Modelling techniques ==
{{Main article|Conceptual model (computer science)}}

As systems have become increasingly complex, the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded. With that expanded presence, the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of a system is being realized. Building on that realization, numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created. These techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the users understanding of the system to be modeled.&lt;ref name="Science Direct"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYX-4GPVP8P-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2006&amp;_alid=1566452383&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5630&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=9090&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d8982c2440adcdec4575f8d0e0e4432f&amp;searchtype=a I. Davies, P. Green, M. Rosemann, M. Indulska, S. Gallo, How do practitioners use conceptual modeling in practice?, Elsevier, Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering 58 (2006) pp.358–80]&lt;/ref&gt; A few techniques are briefly described in the following text, however, many more exist or are being developed. Some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include: [[workflow]] modeling, [[workforce modeling]], [[rapid application development]], [[object-role modeling]], and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).

=== Data flow modeling ===

Data flow modeling (DFM) is a basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of a system. DFM is a fairly simple technique, however, like many conceptual modeling techniques, it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams. The [[data flow diagram]] usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information, but rather works to bring the major system functions into context. Data flow modeling is a central technique used in systems development that utilizes the [[structured systems analysis and design method]] (SSADM).

=== Entity relationship modeling (Ontology oriented) ===

[[Entity-relationship model]]ing (ERM) is a conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, which are a product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships. The entities can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; [[IDEF1X]], [[Bachman diagram|Bachman]], and [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]], to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects.

=== Event-driven process chain ===

The [[event-driven process chain]] (EPC) is a conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven process chain consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed. More specifically, the EPC is made up of events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics.

=== Joint application development ===

The [[dynamic systems development method]] uses a specific process called JEFFF to conceptually model a systems life cycle. JEFFF is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes a projects initialization. The JAD process calls for a series of workshops in which the participants work to identify, define, and generally map a successful project from conception to completion. This method has been found to not work well for large scale applications, however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E. J. | title = Joint application design (JAD) in practice | doi = 10.1016/S0164-1212(98)10080-8 | journal = Journal of Systems and Software | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–23 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place/transition net ===

Also known as [[Petri net]]s, this conceptual modeling technique allows a system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means. The petri net, because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory, is a useful technique for modeling [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent system behavior]], i.e. simultaneous process executions.

=== State transition modeling ===

State transition modeling makes use of [[state transition diagram]]s to describe system behavior. These state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes. Most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling. The use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for [[finite-state machine]]s.

=== Technique evaluation and selection ===
Because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual [[modeling language]] when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique. That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6 | title = A framework for empirical evaluation of conceptual modeling techniques | journal = Requirements Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Considering affecting factors ====

Building on some of their earlier work,&lt;ref name="early Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1145/944217.944243 | title = Evaluating modeling techniques based on models of learning | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 79–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the conceptual model must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, the characteristics of the models users, and the conceptual model languages specific task.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The conceptual models content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the techniques ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the models users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the conceptual models complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that systems realization. The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve to completely different types of conceptual modeling languages.

==== Considering affected variables ====

Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create a "new product", or whether the technique will only bring about a more intimate understanding of the system being modeled. The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective. A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a [[system model]] which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective.

When deciding which conceptual technique to use, the recommendations of Gemino and Wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question. Understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to a more informed selection of a technique that properly addresses that particular model. In summary, when deciding between modeling techniques, answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations.

# What content will the conceptual model represent?
# How will the conceptual model be presented?
# Who will be using or participating in the conceptual model?
# How will the conceptual model describe the system?
# What is the conceptual models focus of observation?
# Will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system?

Another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide a rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness.

==Models in philosophy and science==

=== Mental model ===
{{Further information|Mental model|Representation (psychology)|Cognitive model}}
In cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, a mental model is a representation of something in the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Mental Representation:The Computational Theory of Mind, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/]&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[mental model]] may also refer to a nonphysical external model of the mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Models and Usability, Depaul University, Cognitive Psychology 404, Nov, 15, 1999, Mary Jo Davidson, Laura Dove, Julie Weltz, [http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical models ===
A metaphysical model is a type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope; a metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Matthew H. |editor2-last=Yudell |editor2-first=Zanja |date=2017 |title=Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Science: New Essays |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199363209 |oclc=956947667 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that it [[explanation|explains]] the answers to fundamental questions such as whether [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[mind]] are one or two [[Physical substance|substance]]s; or whether or not humans have [[free will]].

=== Conceptual model vs. semantics model ===
{{confusing|section|reason=the poor English might have a lot to do with it, but it is very hard to define even the basic idea of what the difference is between conceptual and semantic modelling. An example might help|date=October 2014}}

=== Epistemological models ===
An epistemological model is a type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the [[knowledge|known]] and the knowable, and the [[belief|believed]] and the believable.

=== Logical models ===
In [[logic]], a model is a type of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] under which a particular statement is true. Logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts, such as mathematical models; and ones which attempt to represent physical objects, and factual relationships, among which are scientific models.

[[Model theory]] is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A system that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra.

=== Mathematical models ===
{{Main article|Mathematical model}}

Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures.

A more comprehensive type of mathematical model&lt;ref&gt;DI Spivak, RE Kent. "Ologs: a category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation" (2011). PLoS ONE (in press): e24274. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0024274}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a linguistic version of [[category theory]] to model a given situation.  Akin to [[entity-relationship models]], custom [[category (mathematics)|categories]] or [[sketch (mathematics)|sketches]] can be directly translated into [[database schema]]s. The difference is that logic is replaced by category theory, which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling, especially useful for translating between disparate models (as functors between categories).

=== Scientific models ===
{{Main article|Scientific modelling}}

A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. A scientific model represents [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al way.  Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.  The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;edited by Hans Freudenthal (1951), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences]'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical models ==
{{Further information|Statistical model|Parametric model|Nonparametric statistics|Model selection}}
A statistical model is a [[probability distribution function]] proposed as generating data. In a [[parametric model]], the probability distribution function has variable parameters, such as the [[mean]] and [[variance]] in a [[normal distribution]], or the [[coefficients]] for the various [[exponent]]s of the [[independent variable]] in [[linear regression]]. A [[nonparametric statistics|nonparametric model]] has a distribution function without parameters, such as in [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], and is only loosely confined by assumptions. [[Model selection]] is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them; e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]].

In statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, a statistical model of customer behavior is a model that is conceptual (because behavior is physical),  but a statistical model of customer satisfaction is a model of a concept (because satisfaction is a mental not a physical event).

== Social and political models ==

=== Economic models ===
{{Main article|Economic model}}
In [[economics]], a model is a theoretical construct that represents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying parameters in a model or class of models.  A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.

== Models in systems architecture ==
{{Main article|System model}}
A system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure, behavior, and more [[View model|views]] of a [[system]]. A system model can represent [[View model|multiple views]] of a system by using two different approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach. The non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. The architectural approach, also known as [[system architecture]], instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models, will use only one integrated architectural model.

===Business process modelling===
{{Main article|Business process modeling}}
[[File:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction for Business process modelling&lt;ref&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). "Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process." in: ''3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, [[Budapest, Hungary]]'', June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''. Process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering. Process models are:
* Processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model.
* A description of a process at the type level.
* Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it.
The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations.

One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Rolland]] and C. Thanos Pernici (1998). "A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering". In: ''Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98, B. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1413'', [[Pisa, Italy]], Springer, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models in information system design==

=== Conceptual models of human activity systems ===
{{Main article|Soft systems methodology}}
Conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology (SSM), which is a method of systems analysis concerned with the [[Problem structuring methods|structuring of problems]] in management. These models are models of concepts; the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent a state of affairs in the physical world. They are also used in information [[requirements analysis]] (IRA) which is a variant of SSM developed for information system design and software engineering.

=== Logico-linguistic models ===
{{Main article|Logico-linguistic modeling}}
Logico-linguistic modeling is another variant of SSM that uses conceptual models. However, this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events. It is a graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events.

=== Data models ===

==== Entity-relationship model ====
{{Main article|Entity-relationship model}}
In software engineering, an entity-relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity-relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

==== Domain model ====
{{Main article|Domain model}}
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the [[problem domain]]). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity-relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

Concept is usually perceived as a regularity in events or objects or in their records. While constructing a [[concept map]], it is essential to keep in mind that the concept be built with reference to a focus question. Hence, initially, the focus question to which we seek to answer is carefully chosen because learners usually tend to deviate from this question relating only to domains and thus, fails to answer the question.

With the selected domain and the focus question, the next step is to identify the key concepts which apply to this domain.About 15 to 25 concepts is sufficient which is usually ordered in a rank ordered list. Such list should be established from the most general and inclusive concept for the particular chosen problem. This list will assist in at least in the beginning of the construction of the concept map. The list is referred to as Parking Lot since the list is constantly shuffled to build up the required network of the concept. Two or more concepts are connected to each other using linking words or phrases which can only then complete a meaningful sentence.Another important characteristics of a concept map is the [[cross-link]]s.  This cross link acts as the relationship between two different domains  used in the concept map.This helps in a clear representation of the knowledge contained in the concept and also gives a clear background with specific examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/howto/assesslearning/conceptmaps.html |title=Concept Maps - Enhancing Education - Carnegie Mellon University |publisher=Cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

== Form ==

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus general laws ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . . L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the phenomenon ''E'' as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

==Growth==

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

Scientific explanations increasingly pose not [[determinism]]'s universal laws, but [[probabilism]]'s chance,&lt;ref name=Karhausen/&gt; ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;  Smoking's contribution to [[lung cancer]] fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 3], subch "Repudiation of DN model of explanation", pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An [[applied science]] that applies [[statistics]] seeking associations between events, [[epidemiology]] cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.&lt;ref name=Rothman-Greenland&gt;{{Cite journal

See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.

Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.  The ether which he always believed existed had to acquire entirely new properties as a result of this work".&lt;/ref&gt; physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly [[Hendrik Lorentz]] as well as [[Henri Poincaré]] modified [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamic theory]] and, more or less, developed special theory of relativity before Einstein did (Ohanian, ''Einstein's Mistakes'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4DunN-eD3VIC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq= pp 281–85]).  Yet Einstein, free a thinker, took the next step and stated it, more elegantly, without aether (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P180&amp;dq=Lorentz+Einstein p 180]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] independently formalized [[quantum mechanics]] (QM).&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq= pp 113–18].&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite clashing explanations,&lt;ref name=Cushing-p113-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=QMs&gt;Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] posed an [[electron]]'s charge smeared across space as a [[wavefunction|waveform]], later reinterpreted as the electron [[probability amplitude|manifesting across space probabilistically but nowhere definitely]] while eventually building up that deterministic waveform.  Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.

A classic case is the aether, a substance that was supposed by nineteenth-century physicists to permeate all space and make it possible for electromagnetic radiation (like light) to propagate.  It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.

It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.  The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether.  But we do not call it this because it is taboo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Confirmation of the [[Higgs particle]], modeled as a condensation within the [[Higgs field]], corroborates aether,&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt; although physics need not state or even include aether.&lt;ref name=Vongehr/&gt;  Organizing regularities of ''observations''—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover ''aether''.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem/&gt;

In 1905, from [[special relativity]], Einstein deduced [[mass–energy equivalence]],&lt;ref&gt;Mass–energy equivalence is formalized in the equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; particles being variant forms of distributed energy,&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA616&amp;dq=special p 13]: "[A]ccording to the special theory of relativity, both matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy, ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special form of energy".&lt;/ref&gt; how [[particle accelerator|particles colliding at vast speed]] experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles,&lt;ref&gt;Braibant, Giacomelli &amp; Spurio, ''Particles and Fundamental Interactions'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YUUG2pGeIC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=electron+proton+neutron+collisions p 2]: "Any particle can be created in collisions between two high energy particles thanks to a process of transformation of energy in mass".&lt;/ref&gt; although physicists' talk promotes confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]] explained, "People often have the wrong image of what happens inside the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], and I am just as guilty as anyone of perpetuating it.  The machine does not smash together particles to pulverise them and see what is inside.  Rather, it collides them at extremely high energy.  Since, by dint of Einstein's famous equation, [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], energy and mass are one and the same, the combined energy of the collision can be converted into a mass, in other words, a particle, that is heavier than either of the colliding [[proton]]s.  The more energy is involved in the collision, the heavier the particles that might come into being" [Avent, [https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&amp;A"], ''Economist'', 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;  As "the contemporary locus of [[metaphysical]] research", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as ''excitation modes'' of fields,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p396&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P396&amp;dq= p 396].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt; the particles and their masses being states of aether,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13&gt;Wilczek, [http://ctpweb.lns.mit.edu/physics_today/phystoday/Ether.pdf "The persistence of ether"], ''Phys Today'', 1999; '''52''':11,13, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality,&lt;ref name=Riesselmann/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jegerlehner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek-p73&gt;Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), ch 8 "The grid (persistence of ether)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Ether+QCD p 73]: "For natural philosophy, the most important lesson we learn from [[quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is that what we perceive as empty space is in reality a powerful medium whose activity molds the world.  Other developments in modern physics reinforce and enrich that lesson.

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49217">The '''Dormant Commerce Clause''', or '''Negative Commerce Clause''', in [[American constitutional law]], is a [[legal doctrine]] that courts in the [[United States]] have inferred from the [[Commerce Clause]] in [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Norman. "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=700173 Why Congress May Not Overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause]", 53 UCLA L. Rev. 153 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The Dormant Commerce Clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against interstate or international commerce.

For example, it is lawful for [[Michigan]] to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts, if they are present in the product, because the state law applies to food produced in Michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries; the state law would violate the Commerce Clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products. Likewise, [[California]] law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require, which is allowed under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine because California's stricter requirements apply equally to California-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Food and Agriculture – Milk Standards "[https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Milk_and_Dairy_Food_Safety/Milk_Standards.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the doctrine==
The idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive Federal power was discussed even before adoption of the Constitution, but the framers did not use the word "dormant". On September 15, 1787, the [[Framers of the Constitution]] debated in [[Philadelphia]] whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of [[tonnage]] without Congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of [[harbors]] and the building of [[lighthouses]].&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"&gt;2 M. Farrand, [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_3s2.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787], p. 625 (1937) (1787-09-15).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] believed that the mere existence of the Commerce Clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage: "He was more and more convinced that the regulation of Commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

[[Roger Sherman]] disagreed: "The power of the United States to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the State regulations when such interferences happen; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power, the latter being one of the [[concurrent powers]] shared by the federal and state governments.  Ultimately, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]], which says: "No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage ..."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

The word "dormant," in connection with the Commerce Clause, originated in [[dicta]] of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]]. For example, in the case of ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', {{ussc|22|1|1824}}, he wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce "can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant." Concurring Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] was even more emphatic that the Constitution is "altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to Congress of power over commerce."

Later, in the case of ''[[Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co.]]'', {{ussc|27|245|1829}}, Marshall wrote: "We do not think that the [state] act empowering the Black Bird Creek Marsh Company to place a dam across the creek, can, under all the circumstances of the case, be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state, or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject."

If Marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an [[exclusive federal power]], the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine eventually developed very differently: it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power, rather than an exclusive federal power, and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power. Thus, the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but "not absolutely exclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, Frank.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbNdwTo2ENEC&amp;pg=PA41Broken Landscape : Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution: Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution], p. 41 (Oxford University Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The approach began in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court: "Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this [commerce] power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them, what is really applicable but to a part."&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=53&amp;page=299 Cooley v. Board of Wardens], 53 U.S. 299 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear holding of the Supreme Court striking down a state law under the Dormant Commerce Clause came in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Railroad v. Pennsylvania, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=82&amp;invol=232 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of the doctrine==
Justice Anthony Kennedy has written that: "The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent."&lt;ref&gt;C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383 (1994) (quoting The Federalist No. 22, pp.&amp;nbsp;143&amp;ndash;145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton);  Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison 362&amp;ndash;363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to determine whether a law violates a so-called "dormant" aspect of the Commerce Clause, the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce. In this context, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

Thus, in a dormant Commerce Clause case, a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. Discriminatory laws motivated by "simple economic protectionism" are subject to a "virtually per se rule of invalidity", ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'' 437 U.S. 617 (1978), ''[[Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, Wisconsin]]'', 340 U.S. 349 (1951), ''[[Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.]]'', 432 U.S. 333 (1977) which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, ''[[Maine v. Taylor]]'', 477 U.S. 131(1986). See also ''[[Brown-Forman Distillers v. New York State Liquor Authority]]'', {{ussc|476|573|1986}}.

On the other hand, when a law is "directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental" (United Haulers Association, Inc.), that is, where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach, the general contours of which were outlined in ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970) and ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'', 437 U.S. at 624.   If the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist, but still has some impact on interstate commerce, the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test. The Court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits. If such is the case, the law is usually deemed unconstitutional.  See ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|397|137|1970}}. In the Pike case, the Court explained that a state regulation having only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce "will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits".  397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847.  When weighing burdens against benefits, a court should consider both "the nature of the local interest involved, and ... whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities".  Id.  Thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety, or serve other legitimate state interests, but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose, are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test, a minimum level of scrutiny. See ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc.]]'' In USA Recycling, Inc. v. Town of Babylon, 66 F.3d 1272, 1281 (C.A.2 (N.Y.), 1995), the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the state activity constitutes "regulation" of interstate commerce, then the court must proceed to a second inquiry: whether the activity  regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce.  As we use the term here, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  The party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against, or places some burden on, interstate commerce.  ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).  If discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects, and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests.  If the challenging party cannot show that the statute is discriminatory, then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that "is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits."  ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456, 471(1981) (quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==State taxation==
Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the language of the Commerce Clause contains a further, negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject. Examples of such cases are ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992); ''[[Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota]]'', 358 U.S. 450, 458 (1959) and ''[[H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond]]'', 336 U.S. 525 (1949).

More recently, in the 2015 case of ''[[Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne]]'',&lt;ref name=Wynne&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-485_o7jp.pdf Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne] (No. 13-485, May 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court addressed Maryland's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in Maryland, and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside Maryland, ''without'' any tax credit for income tax paid to other states.  The Court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;  The Court faulted Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s criticism of the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by saying that he failed to "explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause 
would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

Application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the Court's holdings that the Commerce Clause prevents a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole, as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The Court's taxation decisions thus "reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic [[Balkanization]] that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the [[Articles of Confederation]]." ''[[Wardair Canada, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue]]'', 477 U.S. 1 (1986); ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322 (1979); ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995).

===Formalistic approach===
As with the Court's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation, the pre-[[New Deal]] Court attempted to apply a [[Commerce Clause#Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence|formalistic approach]] to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce.  The history is described in ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained, however, and the Court's understanding of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns.   In its early stages, the Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation "in any form", "even though the same amount of tax should be laid on (intrastate) commerce".  This position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach, according to which, for example, the Court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce, or upon the "freight carried" in interstate commerce, but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises,  or "'in lieu of all taxes upon (the taxpayer's) property,'" Dissenting from this formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was "too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Decline of formalism===
Accompanying the revolution in approach in the Court's Congressional powers jurisprudence, the New Deal Court began to change its approach to state taxation as well. The Jefferson Lines decision continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with Justice Stone's opinion in ''[[Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue]]'', 303 U.S. 250, which examined New Mexico's franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State.   Although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent, Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law.  ... The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the transition period, some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax, and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved, whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not.  Under this formalistic approach, a tax might be struck down, and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence, but under another name, and then withstand review.

The absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two Railway Express cases.  In the first, a tax imposed by the [[U.S. state|state]] of Virginia on [[United States|American]] business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce. But then, in the second, Virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a "franchise tax" on "intangible property" in the form of "going concern" value as measured by gross receipts.

The Court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes, even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical. There was no real economic difference between the statutes in Railway Express I and Railway Express II. The Court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way. Yet under the Spector rule, the economic realities in Railway Express I became irrelevant. The Spector rule (against privilege taxes) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship, and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the Commerce Clause.

The death knell of formalism occurred in ''[[Complete Auto Transit, Inc v. Brady]]'', 430 U.S. 274 (1977), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=430&amp;invol=274] which approved a Mississippi privilege tax upon a Michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to Mississippi dealers.  The Court there explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appellant's attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the "privilege" of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce. See, e. g., ''[[Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor]]'', 340 U.S. 602 (1951); ''[[Freeman v. Hewit]]'', 329 U.S. 249 (1946). This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the "privilege of doing business"; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of "free trade" immunity from state taxation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complete Auto Transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause.  In overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se, the Court noted the following, in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These four factors, nexus, relationship to benefits, discrimination, and apportionment, have come to be regarded as the four Complete Auto Transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases.  Complete Auto Transit must be recognized as the culmination of the Court's emerging commerce clause approach, not just in taxation, but in all of its aspects.  Application of Complete Auto Transit to State taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture, requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law.&lt;!--   How does a federal court decide whether a tax is "fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer", and what deference should the court show to state legislative determinations?  How does the Court determine whether a tax which is facially non-discriminatory should be upheld or struck down?  What level of nexus is required, and how does one determine that a tax is fairly apportioned.  All of these issues belong in an article on the law of local taxation.--&gt;

==Taxation of international commerce==
In addition to satisfying the four-prong test in ''Complete Auto Transit'', the Supreme Court has held state taxes which burden international commerce cannot create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from "speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments". ''Japan Lines, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles'', 441 U.S. 434 (1979).

In ''Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance'', 505 U.S. 71 (1992), the Supreme Court considered a case in which Iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside Iowa. This differential treatment arose from Iowa's adoption of the definition of "net income" used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa's taxing scheme." Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was "rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency". The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce. The Supreme Court held that "a State's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination."

==Local processing requirements==
Discrimination in the flow of interstate commerce has arisen in a variety of contexts. A line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements.  Under the local processing requirement, a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce.

===No local processing preference===
The basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials.  Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its Carbone decision.  They include ''[[Minnesota v. Barber]]'', 136 U.S. 313, (1890) (striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the State, whether originating within or without the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State);  ''[[Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed within the State);  ''[[Johnson v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 16 (1928) (striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters);  ''[[Toomer v. Witsell]]'', 334 U.S. 385 (1948) (striking down South Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload, pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another State);  ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', supra  (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupes to be packaged within the State prior to export);  ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export).   The Court has defined "protectionist" state legislation as "regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors". ''New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach'', 486 U.S. 269, 273&amp;ndash;74 (1988).

===Carbone: local processing law benefiting private entity===
{{Main|C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York}}

In the 1980s, spurred by [[RCRA]]'s emphasis on comprehensive local planning, many states and municipalities sought to promote investment in more costly disposal technologies, such as [[waste-to-energy]] incinerators, state-of-the-art landfills, composting and recycling.   Some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers.  See Phillip Weinberg, Congress, the Courts, and Solid Waste Transport:  Good Fences Don't Always Make Good Neighbors, 25 Envtl. L. 57 (1995); Atlantic Coast Demolition &amp; Recycling, Inc., 112 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir. 1997).  For about a decade, the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the Carbone decision discussed below.

Flow control laws typically came in various designs.   One common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills, incinerators, composters or other costly disposal sites.    In some locales, choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws, or municipal finance concerns.    If a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator, for example, state laws might require a special approval process.  If approval could be obtained, the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations, or might impact the governmental body's credit rating: in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired.  But by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility, a private entity could issue its own bonds, privately, on the strength of the public's waste assurance.

The private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices.  It can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level, in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources.    Ironically, these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause.

The Town of Clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station.  The transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the Town.    The ordinance had the following features:

Waste hauling in the Town of Clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers, subject to local regulation.  The scheme had the following aspects: (A) The Town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company.     Thus the designated facility was a private company. (B) The Town of Clarkstown forced private haulers to bring their solid waste for local processing at the designated transfer station, even if the ultimate destination of solid waste was an out-of-state disposal site. (C) The primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station.

The Town of Clarkstown's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of Supreme Court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements. In short, it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited. A long line of Supreme Court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce.  As the Court in Carbone wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality.   The avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision, not a bold stroke.  As the Court wrote: "The case decided today, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence."  And, the Court made it plain, that the problem with Clarkstown's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid ... The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are deprived of access to local demand for their services.  Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource&amp;mdash;be it meat, shrimp, or milk&amp;mdash;for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392&amp;ndash;393.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Haulers: local processing law benefiting public entity===
{{main|United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority}}

The Court's 2007 decision in ''[[United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority]]'' starkly illustrates the difference in result when the Court finds that local regulation is not discriminatory.  The Court dealt with a flow control regimen quite similar to that considered in Carbone.   The "only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation."  The Court decided that the balancing test should apply, because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility, but treated all private facilities equally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors. "Conceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities." ''[[General Motors Corp. v. Tracy]]'', 519 U.S. 278 (1997). But States and municipalities are not private businesses&amp;mdash;far from it. Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. See ''[[Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts]]'', 471 U.S. 724 (1985) ... These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's United Haulers decision demonstrates an understanding of the regulatory justifications for flow control starkly missing in the Carbone decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the 1980s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste " 'crisis.' "... Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations. Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars. These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named over local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants The "crisis" extended beyond health and safety concerns. The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime. Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks' notice&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court would not interfere with local government's efforts to solve an important public and safety problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government. The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition. In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities. The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce. But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort. It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services. "The Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Health and safety regulation==
The history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers, on the one hand, as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce. The exact dividing line between the two interests, the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety, and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern.  One Court has written as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, the Court's effort to preserve a national market has, on numerous occasions, come into conflict with the states' traditional power to "legislat[e] on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens."  ''[[Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit]]'', 362 U.S. 440, 443 (1960).  On these occasions, the Supreme Court has "struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States' police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation."  ''[[Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison]]'', 520 U.S. 564, 596 (1997) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing ''[[Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines]]'', 514 U.S. 175, 180&amp;ndash;83 (1995));  see generally [[Boris I. Bittker]], Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce § 6.01[A], at 6&amp;ndash;5 ("[T]he boundaries of the [State's] off-limits area are, and always have been, enveloped in a haze."). Those rules are "simply stated, if not simply applied."  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, 520 U.S. at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in ''[[Exxon Corp. v. Maryland]]'', 437 U.S. 117 (1978), where the State of Maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state. It is difficult to imagine a regimen which might have greater impact on the way in which markets are organized.  Yet, the Court found the legislation constitutionally permitted: "The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce," the Court wrote.  The "Clause protects interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations."

Similarly, in ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456 (1981) the Court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers.  The Court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not 'clearly excessive' in comparison to the state's interest in promoting conservation.  And the court continued:

In Exxon, the Court stressed that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.  A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry.  Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State's legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause.  When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce.  In ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines]]'' 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: 'These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court.  If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective.   Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field.  Unless we can conclude on the whole record that "the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it"  we must uphold the statute.

==Exceptions==
There are two notable exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause to survive court challenges.

===Congressional authorization===
The first exception occurs when Congress has legislated on the matter. See ''[[Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. v. State Board of California]]'', {{ussc|451|648|1981}}. In this case the Dormant Commerce Clause is no longer "dormant" and the issue is a Commerce Clause issue, requiring a determination of whether Congress has approved, preempted, or left untouched the state law at issue.

===Market participation exception===
The second exception is "[[market participation exception]]". This occurs when the state is acting "in the market", like a business or customer, rather than as a "market regulator".&lt;ref&gt;''[[South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82, 87 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks, rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps, it is acting "in the market".  Like any other business in such cases, a state may favor or shun certain customers or suppliers.

The Supreme Court introduced the market participant doctrine in  ''[[Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.]]'', 426 U.S. 794 (1976), which upheld a Maryland program that offered bounties to scrap processors to destroy abandoned automobile hulks. See also ''[[Wisconsin Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986); ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980).  Because Maryland required out-of-state processors, but not in-state processors, to submit burdensome documentation to claim their bounties, the state effectively favored in-state processors over out-of-state processors. The Court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds, the Maryland program affected the market no differently than if Maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks.  Because the state was not "regulating" the market, its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant Commerce Clause&amp;mdash;and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors. "Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others."

Another important case is ''[[White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents.  460 U.S. at 214&amp;ndash;15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were "in a substantial if informal sense, 'working for the city,' " Boston was considered to be simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds.  The Supreme Court stated, "when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause." Id. at 208.  Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.

Other important cases enunciating the market participation exception principle are ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', {{ussc|447|429|1980}} and ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', {{ussc|467|82|1984}}. The ''Reeves'' case outlines the market participation exception test. In this case state-run cement co-ops were allowed to make restrictive rules (e.g. rules not to sell out-of-state). Here, this government-sponsored business was acting restrictively like an individually owned business and this action was held to be constitutional. ''South-Central Timber'' is important because it limits the market exception. ''South-Central Timber'' holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.

The "market participation exception" to the dormant Commerce Clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests, because limits from other laws and Constitutional limits still apply.  In ''[[United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Camden]]'', {{ussc|465|208|1984}}, the city of [[Camden, New Jersey]] had passed an ordinance requiring that at least forty percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors on city projects be Camden residents. The Supreme Court found that while the law was not infirm because of the Dormant Commerce Clause, it violated the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]] of the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist's opinion distinguishes the market-participant doctrine from the privileges and immunities doctrine.  Similarly, Congress has the power itself under the Commerce Clause to regulate and sanction states acting as "market participants", but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate Article IV.

In the 21st century, the dormant Commerce Clause has been a frequent legal issue in cases arising under state laws regulating some aspects of Internet activity. Because of the interstate, and often international, nature of Internet communications, state laws addressing internet-related subjects such as [[spam (electronic)|spam]], online sales or online pornography can often trigger Dormant Commerce Clause issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldsmith |first=Jack L. |authorlink= |author2=Sykes, Alan O. |year=2001 |title=The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=785&amp;ndash;828 |doi=10.2307/797608 |jstor= 797608|quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the doctrine==
A "negative" or "dormant" component to the Commerce Clause has been the subject of scholarly discussion for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;FELIX FRANKFURTER, THE COMMERCE CLAUSE UNDER MARSHALL, TANEY AND WAITE 12 (1937) (describing absence of comment during drafting and ratification of Constitution regarding possible negative implications of Commerce Clause); Albert S. Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 493 (1941) (arguing that historical evidence "supports the view that, as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce, the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority ''pari passu'' from the states.").&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Supreme Court Justices [[Antonin Scalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tyler Pipe Industries v. Department of Revenue]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=483&amp;invol=232 483 U.S. 232] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston]]'', 507 U.S. 60(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (concurring in enforcement of dormant Commerce Clause on stare decisis grounds)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clarence Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'', [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/05-1345_All.pdf 550 U.S. ___] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have rejected the notion of a Dormant Commerce Clause.  They believe that such a doctrine is inconsistent with an [[Originalism|originalist]] interpretation of the Constitution—so much so that they believe the doctrine is a "judicial fraud".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

A number of earlier Supreme Court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.  For example, [[Roger Taney|Chief Justice Taney]] said this in 1847:&lt;ref&gt;License Cases (Thurlow v. Massachusetts; Fletcher v. Rhode Island; Peirce v. New Hampshire), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=46&amp;invol=504 46 U.S. 504 (1847)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was intended to forbid the States from making any regulations of commerce, it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it, when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers ... [T]he legislation of Congress and the States has conformed to this construction from the foundation of the government ... The decisions of this court will also, in my opinion, when carefully examined, be found to sanction the construction I am maintaining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, that statement by Taney in 1847 was before the doctrine morphed in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court that the Commerce Clause does not always require "exclusive legislation by Congress".&lt;ref name=Cooley /&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
In ''Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vázquez'', 977 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1992), the [[First Circuit]] held that the dormant Commerce Clause applies to [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/977/1/305484/ 977 F.2d 1: Trailer Marine Transport Corp., Plaintiff, Appellee, v. Carmen M. Rivera Vazquez, Etc., et al., Defendants, Appellants]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Fa''' ({{zh|s=法}};{{IPA-cmn|fà}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] that covers ethics, logic, and law. It can be translated as "law" in some contexts, but more often as "model" or "standard." First gaining importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought, the concept was principally elaborated in [[Chinese Legalism|Legalism]]. In [[Han Fei]]'s philosophy, the king is the sole source of ''fa'' (law), taught to the common people so that there would be a harmonious society free of chance occurrences, disorder, and "appeal to privilege". High officials were not to be held above ''fa'' (law or protocol), nor were they to be allowed to independently create their own ''fa'', uniting both [[Fiat (policy debate)|executive fiat]] and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei. (2003). Basic Writings. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 7, 21- 28, 40, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], a philosopher that would end up being foundational in [[Han dynasty]] [[Confucianism]], also took up ''fa'', suggesting that it could only be properly assessed by the Confucian [[Sage (Sophos)|sage]] (ruler), and that the most important ''fa'' were the very rituals that Mozi had ridiculed for their ostentatious waste and lack of benefit for the people at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robins |first=Dan |title=Xunzi |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Fall 2008 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and the School of Names==
The concept of ''fa'' first gained importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought. To [[Mozi]], a standard must stand "three tests" in order to determine its efficacy and morality.&lt;ref name="University of Idaho Press"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/308/mozipp.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these tests was its origin; if the standard had precedence in the actions or thought of the semi-mythological [[Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors|sage kings]] of the [[Xia dynasty]] whose examples are frequently cited in classical Chinese philosophy. The second test was one of validity; does the model stand up to evidence in the estimation of the people? The third and final test was one of applicability; this final one is a [[utilitarian]] estimation of the net good that, if implemented, the standard would have on both the people and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mozi. (2003). Basic Writings. Burton Watson, Ed. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The third test speaks to the fact that to the Mohists, a ''fa'' was not simply an abstract model, but an active tool. The real-world use and practical application of ''fa'' were vital. Yet ''fa'' as models were also used in later Mohist logic as principles used in [[Inference|deductive]] reasoning. As classical Chinese philosophical logic was based on [[analogy]] rather than [[syllogism]], ''fa'' were used as benchmarks to determine the validity of logical claims through comparison. There were three ''fa'' in particular that were used by these later Mohists (or "[[School of Names|Logicians]]") to assess such claims, which were mentioned earlier. The first was considered a "root" standard, a concern for precedence and origin. The second, a "source", a concern for [[empiricism]]. The third, a "use", a concern for the [[Consequentialism|consequence]] and pragmatic utility of a standard. These three ''fa'' were used by the Mohists to both promote social welfare and denounce ostentation or wasteful spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Chris |title=Mohism |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2010 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/mohism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

== Generalization, corollaries, usage ==
There are many [[corollary|corollaries]] to Godwin's law, some considered more [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] (by being adopted by Godwin himself)&lt;ref name="Godwin95canonical version" /&gt; than others.&lt;ref name="GL FAQ" /&gt; For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that, when a Hitler comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever made the comparison loses whatever [[debate]] is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html "Internet rules and laws: the top 10, from Godwin to Poe"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=North Korea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tMQs-5SD8|access-date=7 November 2017|series=Last Week Tonight|network=HBO|date=13 August 2017|transcript="There honestly aren't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think: that guy really should have mentioned the nazis, but this is emphatically one of them. It's like the reversed Godwin's law - if you fail to mention Nazism, you lose the argument."|language=English|last=Oliver|first=John (host)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law itself can be abused as a distraction, diversion or even as [[censorship]], fallaciously miscasting an opponent's argument as [[hyperbole]] when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.reason.com/news/show/32944.html "Hands Off Hitler! It's time to repeal Godwin's Law"] ''Reason'' magazine, July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2012/05/adolf-hitler-and-double-standards.html Mitt Hitler and Double Standards: Godwin's Law Applies to Thee, But Not to Me], [[No Pasarán]], May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms of the "law" (or "at least the distorted version which purports to prohibit all comparisons to German crimes") have been made by the American  lawyer, journalist, and author [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.salon.com/2010/07/01/godwin/ The odiousness of the distorted Godwin's Law], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law does not claim to articulate a [[fallacy]]; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons. "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of [[mathematics]]," Godwin wrote, "its purpose has always been [[Rhetorics|rhetorical]] and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler to think a bit harder about [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/post/i_seem_be_verb_18_years_godwins_law|title=I Seem To Be A Verb: 18 Years of Godwin's Law|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Jewcy.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mike Godwin June08 B recrop 5 to 7.jpg|thumb|Mike Godwin in 2008]]

Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="Godwin94" /&gt;

In 2012, "Godwin's law" became an entry in the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/340583?redirectedFrom=Godwin%27s+law#eid|title=Godwin's law|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Godwin commented on the Nazi and fascist comparisons being made by several articles about [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying: "If you're thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godwin|first1=Mike|title=Sure, call Trump a Nazi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16265">There are a number of meanings for the term [[humanitarian]].  Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating [[suffering]].  It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict.  '''Humanitarian principles''' govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.

==Core humanitarian principles==

===Humanity===
The principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody3  Pictet (1979) Humanity]. [[Jean Pictet|Pictet's]] commentary is focused on the Red Cross use of the principle of humanity, but includes more general comments relevant to the whole humanitarian sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Imperative===
The [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance.  It states the obligation of the international community "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed."&lt;ref&gt;For a critical view see: Hugo Slim, "Relief agencies and moral standing in war: principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and solidarity, Development in Practice, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4/August 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality===
Provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] must be [[impartiality|impartial]] and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.  It must be based on need alone.

For most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO.  However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;(See:  [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping]] (Brahimi report)pp. ix &amp; 9){{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114055129/http://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Humanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.

Problems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors.  Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities.  The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments  through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.&lt;ref&gt;(see: [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1996_3/18-19.html Joanna Macrae: NGOs: Has the 'N' gone missing?] [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1998_2/2-7.html Randolph Kent: Footing the aid bill])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining principles===
The core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.

==Additional humanitarian principles==
In addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.

===Neutrality===
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality.  For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

The principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to "engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature."  The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.

[[neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]] can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state.  "Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing.  GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature.  According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of the concept of neutrality with respect to humanitarian response see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z Denise Plattner])&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone.  Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.

===Proselytism===
The provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds.  All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.

==Principles based on field experience in emergencies==
All of the above principles are important requirements for  effective field operations.  They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response.  In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.

If a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger.  If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.

==Sources==
The core principles, found in the [[Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct]] and in GA Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality—in the case of the UN), and IV (independence).&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of their background and a commentary on the principles see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5mje9n Jean Pictet 1979])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian accountability ==
Accountability has been defined as: "the processes through which an organisation makes a 
commitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, Robert M. |author2=Monica Blagescu |author3=Lucy de las Casas |title=Pathways to Accountability: The Gap Framework |publisher=One World Trust |location= |year=2005 |pages= 5|isbn=0-9504434-6-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=dtrust.org/documents/Pathways_to_Accountability,_A_Short_Guide_to_the_GAP_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] adds: "Accountability is about using power responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/other/faq.aspx#top|title=HAPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] states:
"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries.  However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly "upward accountability", i.e. to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anderson: {{cite web |url=http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180533/http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries.  Examples include the [[Sphere Project]], [[ALNAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/|title=ALNAP - Home|website=www.alnap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103064539/http://www.compasqualite.org/en/index/index.php|title=Quality COMPAS - Homepage|date=3 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[People In Aid]] Code of Good Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleinaid.org/code/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], which runs a "global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies."

==Additional principles==
The RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience  with development assistance.
*Agencies should operate with respect to culture and custom
*Humanitarian response should use local resources and capacities as much as possible
*The participation of the beneficiaries should be encouraged
*Emergency response should strive to reduce future vulnerabilities
*Agencies should be accountable to both donors and beneficiaries
*Humanitarian agencies should use information activities to portray victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects

==The right to life with dignity==
The Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Sphere Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the language of human rights to remind that the [[right to life]] which is proclaimed in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] is related to [[human dignity]].

==Vulnerability and behavioral issues==
Humanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations.  However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] of those affected by war and violence.  Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.

===Sexual exploitation and abuse===
One of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation and abuse]] of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers.  In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

A number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses.  In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment.  The plan explicitly prohibited the "Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour."  The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;(See:[http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex IASC, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120184234/http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex |date=2006-11-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Substantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The [[People In Aid#The People In Aid Code of Good Practice|People In Aid Code of Good Practice]], an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.

Structures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.

The RC/NGO Code is self-enforcing. The [[SCHR]] carries out peer reviews among its members which look in part at the issue of compliance with principles set out in the RC/NGO Code

'''Hume's fork''' is an explanation, developed by later [[philosopher]]s, of [[David Hume]]'s 1730s division of "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence".&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;[[Antony Flew]], ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork p 156].&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between [[Modal logic|necessary]] versus [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] (concerning reality), {{nowrap|''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''}} versus {{nowrap|''[[a posteriori]]''}} (concerning knowledge), and [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] versus [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">[[File:Logical-hexagon.png|thumb|250px|right|The logical hexagon extends the [[square of opposition]] to six statements.]]

The '''logical hexagon''' (also called the '''hexagon of opposition''') is a [[conceptual model]] of the relationships between the [[truth value]]s of six [[statement (logic)|statement]]s. It is an extension of [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]]. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-opposition theory ''logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension consists in introducing two statements '''U''' and '''Y'''. Whereas '''U''' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of '''A''' and '''E''', '''Y''' is the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the two traditional particulars '''I''' and '''O'''.

== Summary of relationships ==

The traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories '''A''' and '''O''', and '''E''' and '''I''' (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries '''A''' and '''E''' (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries '''I''' and '''O''' (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle’s definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that '''U''' and '''Y''' are also contradictory.

== Interpretations of the logical hexagon ==

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.

For instance, the statement A may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x))

The statement E may be interpreted as "Whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → ~W(x))

The statement I may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white."

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x))

The statement O may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement Y may be interpreted as "There exists at least one x that is both a man and white and there exists at least one x that is both a man and non-white"

    (∃x)(M(x) &amp; W(x)) &amp; (∃x)(M(x) &amp; ~W(x))

The statement U may be interpreted as "One of two things, either whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is white or whatever x may be, if x is a man, then x is non-white."

    (x)(M(x) → W(x)) w (x)(M(x) → ~W(x)) 

The logical hexagon may be interpreted in various ways, including as a model of traditional logic, quantifications, modal logic, order theory, or paraconsistent logic.



=== Modal logic ===

The logical hexagon may be interpreted as a model of modal logic such that

* '''A''' is interpreted as [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessity]]
* '''E''' is interpreted as impossibility
* '''I''' is interpreted as [[logical possibility|possibility]]
* '''O''' is interpreted as 'not necessarily'
* '''U''' is interpreted as non-contingency
* '''Y''' is interpreted as [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]

== Further extension ==
It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a “[[logical cube]]”, belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called “logical bi-simplexes of dimension n.” The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">In economics, the '''marginal product of labor''' ('''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in output that results from employing an added unit of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin  | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ  | page = 108 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian?

Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

{{distinguish|negative liberties|positive liberties}}
'''Negative and positive rights''' are [[rights]] that oblige either action (''positive rights'') or inaction (''negative rights''). These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley J.|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/09/03/right-to-die-means-a-physician-duty-to-kill/|title=The 'Right to Die' Means a Physician Duty to Kill?|date=3 September 2009|website=First Things|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'', Appel has written:
{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

==Mechanism==
[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

==Smoke test==
A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">'''Negative staining''' is an established method, often used in diagnostic [[microscopy]], for contrasting a thin specimen with an optically opaque fluid. In this technique, the background is stained, leaving the actual specimen untouched, and thus visible. This contrasts with 'positive staining', in which the actual specimen is stained.

For [[bright field microscopy]], negative staining is typically performed using a black ink fluid such as nigrosin and India ink. The specimen, such as a wet [[bacteria]]l culture spread on a glass slide, is mixed with the negative stain and allowed to dry. When viewed with the [[microscope]] the bacterial cells, and perhaps their [[spore]]s, appear light against the dark surrounding background. An alternative method has been developed using an ordinary waterproof marking pen to deliver the negative stain.&lt;ref&gt;S. Woeste and P. Demchick (1991). Appl Environ Microbiol. 57(6): 1858-1859 http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/6/1858&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[transmission electron microscopy]], opaqueness to [[electron]]s is related to the [[atomic number]], i.e., the number of protons. Some suitable negative stains include [[ammonium molybdate]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl formate]], [[phosphotungstic acid]], [[osmium tetroxide]], osmium ferricyanide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle| author = D. Chadwick| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| year = 2002| isbn = 0-470-84479-5| pages =259–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[auroglucothionate]]. These have been chosen because they scatter electrons strongly and also adsorb to biological matter well. The structures which can be negatively stained are much smaller than those studied with the light microscope. Here, the method is used to view [[virus]]es, bacteria, bacterial [[flagella]], [[biological membrane]] structures and [[protein]]s or protein aggregates, which all have a low electron-scattering power.  Some stains, such as osmium tetroxide and osmium ferricyanide, are very chemically active. As strong oxidants, they cross-link lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, and thereby both fix biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stain them.&lt;ref name="Bozzola"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-7637-0192-5|chapter = Specimen Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscopy|pages = 21&amp;ndash;31|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&amp;pg=PA21|first = John J.|last = Bozzola|author2=Russell, Lonnie D.| year = 1999|publisher = Jones and Bartlett|location = Sudbury, Mass.|title = Electron microscopy : principles and techniques for biologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 45–61| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nfsVMH8it1kC| title = Principles and techniques of electron microscopy: biological applications| author = M.

The choice of negative stain in [[electron microscopy]] can be very important. An early study of plant viruses using negatively stained leaf dips from a diseased plant showed only spherical viruses with one stain and only rod-shaped viruses with another. The verified conclusion was that this plant suffered from a mixed infection by two separate viruses. 
Negative staining at both light microscope and electron microscope level should never be performed with [[infection|infectious]] organisms unless stringent safety precautions are followed. Negative staining is usually a very mild preparation method and thus does not reduce the possibility of operator infection.

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | direction = vertical
   | footer    =

Entropy, thermodynamic beta, and temperature as a function of the energy for a system of ''N'' noninteracting two-level particles.

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

'''Negative utilitarianism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[utilitarianism]] that gives greater priority to reducing [[suffering]] (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing [[pleasure|happiness]] (positive utility).&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Leslie|1998|page=12}}: "'Negative utilitarianism' is concerned mainly or entirely with reducing evils rather than with maximizing goods." The example unpleasant experiences is an example based on a hedonistic theory of well-being, according to which pleasant experiences are good for individuals and unpleasant experiences are bad for individuals. But there are other theories of well-being and negative utilitarianism need not adopt a hedonistic theory.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|loc=chpt. 4}} The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the ''only'' thing that ultimately matters morally.{{sfn|Smart|1958}} Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are ''only'' concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that ''both'' positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} says that strong versions of negative utilitarianism "give all weight to disutility" and weak versions "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.” {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the well-being in an outcome depends on [[antifrustrationism|frustrated preferences]]. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.

The term "negative utilitarianism" was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. Ninian Smart]] in 1958 in his reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]''. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism:{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering.  {{sfn|Smart|1958|p=542}} Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.

== History ==
The term ‘negative utilitarianism’ was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] in his 1958 reply to [[Karl Popper]]'s book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|p=542}}: "Professor Popper has proposed a negative formulation of the utilitarian principle, so that we should replace ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’ by ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’. He says: ‘It adds to the clarity of ethics if we formulate our demands negatively, i.e. if we demand the elimination of suffering rather than the promotion of happiness’. However, one may reply to negative utilitarianism..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Popper wrote, "I suggest, for this reason, to replace the utilitarian formula ‘Aim at the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number’, or briefly, ‘Maximize happiness’ by the formula ‘The least amount of avoidable suffering for all’, or briefly, ‘Minimize suffering’. {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415610216|page=548}} Popper claimed that "there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula "Maximize pleasure" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all..." {{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Contestabile|2014|page=298}}: "Negative utilitarianism and Buddhism share the following intuitions: Negative utilitarianism—understood as an umbrella term—models the asymmetry between suffering and happiness and therefore accords with the Buddhist intuition of universal compassion. The Noble Truths of Buddhism accord with the negative utilitarian intuition that (global) suffering cannot be compensated by happiness. Some forms of Buddhism and negative utilitarianism share the intuition that non-existence is a perfect state." {{harvnb|Goodman|2009|page=101}}: “Negative utilitarianism shares with Buddhism a strong focus on alleviating the suffering of beings.”&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keown|1992|page=175}}: “one of the earliest exponents of NU, Hegesias...”&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist [[Edmund Gurney]] who wrote:

{{quote|Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability . . . of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer . . . in the negative. . . . When we forget pain, or underestimate it, or talk about people 'getting used to it', we are really so far losing sight of what the universe, which we wish to conceive adequately, really is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.com/gurney/index.html|title=Edmund Gurney (1847 - 88)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Versions of negative utilitarianism ==
Like other kinds of [[utilitarianism]], negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative [[preference utilitarianism]] says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness.{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the ''actual'' or ''expected'' consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the ''average'' outcome among individuals or the ''total'' net utility (or lack of disutility) among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinnott-Armstrong|2014}} provides a nice overview of the many ways in which consequentialism can be varied. Since utilitarianism (and negative utilitarianism) is a kind of consequentialism, much of it applies to utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism as well. Section 1. "Classic Utilitarianism" shows the many distinct and variable claims that make up Classic Utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative utilitarianism can aim either to ''optimize'' the value of the outcome or it can be a ''satisficing'' negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be ''sufficiently'' valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=102}}, states satisficing utilitarianism as follows: "''Satisficing utilitarianism'' An action ought to be done if and only if it would bring about a sufficient level of total well-being."&lt;/ref&gt; A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.

=== The weight of evil (disutility) ===
Philosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility.&lt;ref&gt;They write that they distinguish among kinds of 'negative utilitarianism': "Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family. The problem was then to find out which members of this family we want to join, and to spell out why we do not want to be as some of our siblings." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}. The taxonomy is phrased in terms of 'negativisms,' which appear to be the same as 'negativist' and 'negative' utilitarianisms: "we believe that disutility has greater weight than utility. The overall aim with this part of our essay is to give an account of this weight, which means that we shall try to formulate a welfarist act-consequentialism that takes seriously the weight of disutility. In other words, we are looking for an acceptable negativist utilitarianism." {{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pp=30,38}} They first distinguish between ''strong negativism'' and ''weak negativism''. Strong negativism "give all weight to disutility" and weak negativism "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=29}} The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=39}}: "The claim that disutility has greater weight can now be expressed by letting the disutilities have greater lexical weight. But still the utility has some weight in the sense that if the disutilities are the same in the alternatives, and hence we cannot minimise the disutility any further, then we ought to maximise the utility. Depending on what kinds of disutilities we choose in establishing this order, we get different lexical negativisms."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "''Lexical Threshold NU''
Suffering and happiness both count, but there is some amount of suffering that no amount of happiness can outweigh."&lt;/ref&gt; 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not "agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Tomasik formulated and advocated consent-based negative utilitarianism. He writes, "would the person-moment suffering agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future? If yes, then the suffering doesn't pass the threshold of unbearableness and thus can be outweighed by happiness." {{harvnb|Tomasik|2015}}. See section “Consent-based negative utilitarianism?” The ‘person-moment’ means the person in the moment of suffering, as opposed to before or after the suffering occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other distinctions among versions of negative utilitarianism ===
[[Thomas Metzinger]] proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metzinger|2003|page=622}}: “In terms of a fundamental solidarity of all suffering beings against suffering, something that almost all of us should be able to agree on is what I will term the “principle of negative utilitarianism”: Whatever else our exact ethical commitments and specific positive goals are, we can and should certainly all agree that, in principle, and whenever possible, the overall amount of conscious suffering in all beings capable of conscious suffering should be minimized. I know that it is impossible to give any truly conclusive argument in favor of this principle. And, of course, there exist all kinds of theoretical complications—for example, individual rights, long-term preferences, and epistemic indeterminacy. But the underlying intuition is something that can be shared by almost everybody: We can all agree that no additional suffering should be created without need. Albert Camus once spoke about the solidarity of all finite beings against death, and in just the same sense there should be a solidarity of all sentient beings capable of suffering against suffering. Out of this solidarity we should not do anything that would increase the overall amount of suffering and confusion in the universe—let alone something that highly ''likely'' will have this effect right from the beginning.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Bunge]] writes about negative utilitarianism in his ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'' but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "By recommending passivity it [negative utilitarianism] condones evil. The spectator who watches impassively a hooligan attacking an old woman, and the citizen who does not bother to vote, comply with negative utilitarianism and thereby tolerate evil."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvnb|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The benevolent world-exploder ==
In the 1958 article where [[Ninian Smart|R. N. Smart]] introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, "a benevolent world-exploder," would have a duty to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smart|1958|page=542}}: "Suppose that a ruler controls a weapon capable of instantly and painlessly destroying the human race. Now it is empirically certain that there would be some suffering before all those alive on any proposed destruction day were to die in the natural course of events. Consequently the use of the weapon is bound to diminish suffering, and would be the ruler's duty on NU grounds." For his use of the term ‘the benevolent world-exploder’ see page 543.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism,{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=31}} and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;That is, the argument is directed against strong versions of negative utilitarainaism that prescribe only reducing negative well-being, as well as weak versions that are sufficiently close to strong negative utilitarianism. Such weak versions would be those that, although they give weight to both negative and positive well-being, give sufficiently much more the weight to negative well-being, so that they would have the same implications as strong versions in relevant situations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors have endorsed this argument,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Bunge|1989|p=230}}: "Negative utilitarianism ... is open to the following objections.... Fourthly, the most expeditious way of implementing the doctrine would be to exterminate humankind, for then human suffering would cease altogether (R. N. Smart 1958)." {{harvnb|Heyd|1992|p=60}}: "Negative utilitarianism, which seems promising in guiding us in genethics, also urges (at least in its impersonal version) paradoxical (and to some, morally abhorrent) solutions to the miseries of humanity. Primarily it recommends the painless annihilation of all humanity—either by the collective suicide of all actual beings, or by total abstention from procreation by one generation (Smart 1958, 542-543)." {{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: "R. N. Smart wrote a response [3] in which he christened the principle 'Negative Utilitarianism' and showed a major unattractive consequence. A thorough going Negative Utilitarian would support the destruction of the world (even by violent means) as the suffering involved would be small compared to the suffering in everyday life in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.

=== Cooperation between different value systems ===
One possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains from Trade through Compromise – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reasons to Be Nice to Other Value Systems – Foundational Research Institute|url = http://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/|website = foundational-research.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html|title = Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminating vs. reducing disutility ===
Another reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating.&lt;ref&gt;This is essentially [[H. B. Acton]]'s reply. {{harvnb|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=84}}: "Eliminating suffering is not the same thing as reducing it or as arriving at 'the least amount of avoidable suffering for all', and it is the latter, not the former, that might, with some plausibility, be regarded as a possible substitute for the more usual form of utilitarianism. Would not, then, the destroyer imagined by Smart be making a terrible mistake through failing to notice the difference between eliminating and reducing?"&lt;/ref&gt; A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[J. J. C. Smart]]'s reply to Acton. J. J. C. Smart agrees with his brother R. N. Smart that "if we made the minimization of misery our sole ultimate ethical principle ... we should approve of a tyrannical but benevolent world exploder." {{harvnb|Smart|1973|page=29}} J. J. C. Smart replies to Acton that "surely eliminating is a case of reducing – the best case of all, the negative utilitarian would say. In suggesting that eliminating is not reducing, Acton seems to me to be like a person who says that zero is not a number." {{harvnb|Smart|1989||p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempting world destruction would be counterproductive ===
Several philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]], who says that "planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution."{{sfn|Pearce|2005}} Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that "life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed."{{sfn|Pearce|Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative?}} A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that "anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful."&lt;ref&gt;Clark Wolf proposes and defends ‘negative critical level utilitarianism’ in the context of social choice and population choices, which says that "population choices should be guided by an aim to minimize suffering and deprivation" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=273}}. He brings up the possible objection to his principle that "it might occur to someone that the best way to minimize current suffering and deprivation would be to quietly, secretly, and painlessly kill off all of those who are miserable and needy" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}. A part of his reply is that "die hard utilitarians could argue that we rarely face such a policy choice, and that anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful" {{harv|Wolf|1996|page=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question "3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?" begins with "No, that would very bad even by NU standards."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}

=== Life could evolve again in a worse way ===
Some replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by [[John W. N. Watkins]] is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. N. Watkins]] describes himself as "a sort of negative utilitarian" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=95}}. He replies to R. N. Smart that "even if all life ''were'' destroyed, in due course living matter might emerge from the slime once more, and the evolutionary process start up again—this time accompanied, perhaps, by even more pain than would have accompanied the continued existence of the human race. So the pain minimiser would need to destroy the very ''possibility'' of life. And I like to think that this is something which is ''in principle'' beyond human power" {{harv|Acton|Watkins|1963|page=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,

{{quote|I am also a little puzzled by Watkin's remark that the pain minimizer would have to destroy the ''very possibility'' of life. If the sentient forms of life were totally destroyed, it might be that the sentient forms would be most unlikely to evolve. This is on the supposition, held by some experts, that the evolution of higher forms of life on earth depended on a lot of lucky accidents. If this is not the case, then the benevolent world destroyer should ensure that ''all'' forms of life are destroyed, even bacteria and plants and insects, but should this be impossible the world destroyer might have at least ensured a pain free globe for hundreds of millions of years to come. In any case my brother's example was of a world ''exploder'', and I think this would ensure the destruction of ''all'' life on earth. Of course there might be sentient life on planets of distant stars. No doubt the world exploder can do nothing about this, even with the resources of a future physics, but his or her negative utilitarian duty would not be to do the impossible, but would be to minimize suffering as much as lies within his or her power.{{sfn|Smart|1989||pp=44-45}}}}

=== Getting killed would be a great evil ===
Another related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: "He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them."{{sfn|Kadlec|2008|110}}

=== Frustrated preferences ===
Negative [[preference utilitarianism]] has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions.&lt;ref&gt;"A preferentialist could, for example, claim that most people now living prefer to live, and that these preferences must be counted when elimination is at stake. So, the elimination results in a lot of frustrated preferences, and we must balance the evil ofthis against the evil of the unhappiness in the future of humanity." {{harv|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}} Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.{{sfn|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=32}}

The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;"NIPU [negative ideal preference utilitarianism] isn’t about minimizing the amount of unsatisfied preferences that currently exist, but rather about minimizing the total amount of unsatisfied preferences in the (space-time) universe. This includes past preferences." {{harv|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that "instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal."{{sfn|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}} The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negative Utilitarianism FAQ|2015}}. See section "2.1.5 Back to destroying the world, doesn’t NIPU still imply that extinction would be best, because if there will be a lot of people in the future, their unsatisfied preferences combined are worse than the preferences being thwarted by extinction?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combining negative utilitarianism with rights ===
A part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,

{{quote|A more direct way to address this problem would be to incorporate a theory of rights, stipulating that in general, policy makers simply have no right to make decisions about whether the lives of others are worth living, or whether they should live or die. Since it is clear that policy makers have no right to kill off the miserable and destitute, this response gains support from our moral intuitions.{{sfn|Wolf|1996|p=278}}}}

Negative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice.{{sfn|Contestabile|Negative Utilitarianism and Justice}} Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims{{sfn|Rawls|1958|p=174}} and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.

== Other works ==
[[Toby Ord]] provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay "Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,"{{sfn|Ord|2013}} to which [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] and Bruno Contestabile have replied.{{sfn|Pearce|A response to Toby Ord's essay}}{{sfn|Contestabile|Why I’m (Not) a Negative Utilitarian – A Review of Toby Ord’s Essay}} Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|2012|pages=1–2}}: "Negative utilitarianism is well-known for entailing anti-natalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud."&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Belshaw,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belshaw|2012|page=118}}: "Negative utilitarianism can be plucked from the shelf, but there is no good reason to suppose it true. And were it true, it would take us too far, generating not only anti-natalism but straightaway also its pro-mortalist neighbour."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingmar Persson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Persson|2009|page=38}}: “negative utilitarianism seems implausible, as is shown by an argument sketched by McMahan, on the basis of an argument originally put forward by Richard Sikora (1978). This argument turns on the observation that if what would be bad for individuals in life is a reason against conceiving them, but what would be good for them is no reason in favour of conceiving them, then, as far as those individuals are concerned, it is wrong to conceive them, however much good their lives will contain, provided that they will also contain something that is bad for them. This seems clearly absurd.”&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle

{{quote|is a kind of maximin rule.... The principle also resembles a form of utilitarianism which is familiar from the work of Popper and the Smart brothers, negative utilitarianism. That too suggests we should concern ourselves before all else with the elimination of pain.{{sfn|Mendola|1990|p=86}}}} Professor Henry Hiz writes favorably of negative utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiz|1992|page=423}}: "Utilitarianism failed, but what is sometimes called ‘negative utilitarianism’ avoids many of the shortcomings of classical utilitarianism. It is a good candidate for an ethics that expresses the Enlightenment tradition."&lt;/ref&gt; Fabian Fricke published the German article "Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus."{{sfn|Fricke|2002}} In book format, Jonathan Leighton has defended 'negative utilitarianism plus', which holds the reduction of suffering to be of highest importance, while also valuing the continued existence of sentient beings.{{sfn|Leighton|2011}}

In [[experimental physics]], researchers have proposed '''Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamic theory''' to describe phenomena observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]].  This theory investigates a [[Fireball concept|fireball]] for [[high-energy particle]] collisions, while using [[Tsallis entropy|Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or [[self-consistency principle]], just as in the [[Boltzmann statistics]] used by [[Rolf Hagedorn]].&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; Assuming the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, [[Abdel Nasser Tawfik]] applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production.&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt;&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt;

The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from Tsallis&lt;ref&gt;C. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et al&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the [[LHC]], with q&gt;1.

==Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas==
The starting point of the theory is [[entropy]] for a non-extensive quantum gas of [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino,&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; which is given by &lt;math&gt;S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_q^{FD}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Fermi–Dirac entropy and &lt;math&gt;S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Bose–Einstein entropy.

That group&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; and also Clemens and Worku,&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt; the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck,&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt; shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in [[high energy physics]] experiments.

== Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas ==
Using the entropy defined above, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] results are
:&lt;math&gt; \ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\frac{V_o}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int_0^{\infty}dm \int_0^{\infty}dp \, p^2 \rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\beta \sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since experiments have shown that &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this restriction is adopted.

Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\int_0^{\infty}\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\beta E]^{-\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the density of states of the fireballs.

==Self-consistency principle==
Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the [[mass spectrum]] and the [[density of states]] must be related to each other by
:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;,
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;m,E&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large.

The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosing&lt;ref name=depp1&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m^{3/2} \rho(m)=\frac{\gamma}{m}\big[1+(q_o-1) \beta _o m\big]^{\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\frac{\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1)  m]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)=bE^a\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\big]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;q'_o-1=\beta _o (q_o-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants. For &lt;math&gt;q' \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory.

==Main results==
With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T) \rightarrow \bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; a+1=\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt;. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.&lt;ref  name=hage&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor.

==Experimental evidence==

Experimental evidence of the existence of a limiting temperature and of a limiting entropic index can be found in [[Jean Cleymans|J. Cleymans]] and collaborators,&lt;ref name=cley1&gt;J.

[[File:William of Ockham - Logica 1341.jpg|thumb|William of Ockham]]
'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov JJ McCall – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Another technical approach to Occam's razor is [[Ontological commitment#Ontological parsimony|ontological parsimony]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;
{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Alan |title=Simplicity |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/simplicity/#OntPar |date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity. This is considered a strong version of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|title=What is Occam's Razor?|website=math.ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706234202/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Everywhere The Soles of Your Feet Shall Tread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shdlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |author=Stormy Dawn |date=17 July 2017 |isbn=9781480838024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation used in medicine is called the "[[Zebra (medicine)|Zebra]]": a doctor should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely, derived from [[Theodore Woodward]]'s dictum "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sotos |first=John G. |year=2006 |origyear=1991 |title=Zebra Cards: An Aid to Obscure Diagnoses |location=Mt.

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L.

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David M. Boulton; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 11, Issue 2, 1968 Page(s):185–194, "An information measure for classification."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David L. Dowe; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 4, Sep 1999 Page(s):270–283, "Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a connection between Occam's razor and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|title=A short introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length|last=Nannen|first=Volker|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602044851/http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Phonemic imagery''' refers to the processing of thoughts as words rather than as symbols or other images.  It is sometimes referred to as the equivalent of [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]]&lt;ref name=Velmans/&gt; or [[Imagined speech|covert speech]],{{cn|date=December 2013}} and sometimes considered as a third phenomenon, separate from but similar to these other forms of internal speech.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

Phonemic imagery is a part of the philosophy of [[consciousness]] rather than [[linguistics]] as it is considered an internal phenomenon of consciousness observed through [[Introspection|reflection]] rather than amenable to [[empirical]] observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12954">The '''Plastic Principle''' is an idea introduced into Western thought by the English philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] (1617–1689) to explain the function of nature and life in the face of both the mechanism and materialism of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It is a dynamic functional power that contains all of natural law, and is both sustentative and generative, organizing matter according to Platonic Ideas, that is, archetypes that lie beyond the physical realm coming from the Mind of God or Deity, the ground of Being.

== Background ==

The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) – deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the "ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within."&lt;ref name=Giglioni&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giglioni|first=Guido|title=The cosmoplastic system of the universe: Ralph Cudworth on Stoic naturalism|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences|year=2008/2|volume=Tome 61|pages=313–331|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-revue-d-histoire-des-sciences-2008-2-page-313.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.

== Cambridge Platonists ==
The Cartesian idea of nature as mechanical, and Hobbes' materialistic views were countered by the English philosopher, Ralph Cudworth (1617–1689), who, in his ''True intellectual system of the universe'' (1678), addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (''anima mundi'') to posit a power that was polaric – "either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle – either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios.&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth was a member of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato's teachings but also were aware or and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614–1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato's ''anima mundi'' or world soul, and the Stoic's pneuma, which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (''psyche'') and ''soma''.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford U. Encyc. of Philosophy|title=The Cambridge Platonists|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cambridge-platonists/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cudworth's idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature' ==

Like More, Cudworth put forward the idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature', a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness.

:It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,—an instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God...&lt;ref name="1902 Encyc."&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1902|title=Ralph Cudworth|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/C/CUD/ralph-cudworth.html|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of the atheistic approaches posted nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge's 'chance whirlings of unproductive particles'). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach's ''Bildungstreib'']] (generative power) and the ''Lebenskraft'' (or ''Bildungskraft'').

:...the life of the universe splits into two principles&amp;nbsp;– the one transcendent and intellectual (« an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world »), the other immanent and devoid of perception (« a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things »)&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or ''Logos''. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the "phenomenon of nature." Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it 'deified' matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced "substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity."&lt;ref name=Giglioni /&gt;

Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as 'Inward Principles' of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition:
:The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165)&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Justin E. H.|title=The Leibnizian Organism Between Cudworth's Plastic Natures and Locke's Thinking Matter|url=http://www.bib.umontreal.ca/colloqueNE/textes_des_communications/Smith.pdf|publisher=Concordia University, Montreal|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, Cudsworth's plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote:
:The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things.&lt;ref name=Raiger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raiger|first=Michael|title=The Intellectual Breeze, the Corporeality of Thought, and the Eolian Harp|journal=Coleridge Bulletin|date=Winter 2002|series=New Series|issue=20|pages=76–84|url=http://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/CB20Raiger.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another historian notes in conclusion, "Cudworth’s theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Plastic Principle and mind ==
Cudworth's plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is "the spermatic reason" which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible 'Ideas' in the Platonic sense.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God's will or not. Cudworth's 'hegemonikon' (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or ''psyche'' and ''soma''. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self-directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.

== Influence on Locke ==
Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the 'thinking' mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations ('simple ideas') and the second by reflection – "observation of its own inner operations" (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which 'simple ideas' are taken up by the mind's self-activity, an "active power" such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See [[Romantic medicine]] and [[Brunonian system of medicine]]).
[[Thomas Reid]] and his "Common Sense" philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an 'aether' or 'aetherial medium' that causes 'vibrations' that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the 'attractions' of entities to each other.

:The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this æthereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this æthereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this æther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107–8)&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Berkeley meant this 'aether' to supplant Newton's gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley's conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.

Both Cudworth's views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his 'Effusion XXXV' as one commentator noted: "what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth’s principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God’s immanent activity."&lt;ref name="Raiger"/&gt;

Cudworth's idea of the plastic principle and that of mind will also be taken up in a new way in the idea of [[emergent evolution]].

[[Monadology|Monadologie]], §§ 81, 82. —ED."&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of the principle is usually attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in [[Anselm of Canterbury]]: his phrase [http://12koerbe.de/pan/curdeus5.htm ''quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit''] and the formulation of the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. A clearer connection is with the [[cosmological argument for the existence of God]]. The principle can be seen in both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]]. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in [[A. O. Lovejoy]], ''The Great Chain of Being''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including [[Anaximander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|page= 152|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parmenides]], [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"&gt;{{cite web |title= Principle of Sufficient Reason |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"/&gt; [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kara|title=Avicenna and the Principle of Sufficient Reason|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=4|pages=743–768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spinoza |last=Della Rocca |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0415283302 |pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with "''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss (2007) "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason" in ''Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy'' Ch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton attributes this expression to [[Cicero]]; Hamilton 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] identified the laws of inference [[modus ponens]] with the "law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent" and [[modus tollens]] with its [[contrapositive]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:241–242: “2°, "If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, – that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, – If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent." &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: ''Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio''. Or, otherwise, ''a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia''. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of ''modus ponens'', the other of the ''modus tollens''. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. —ED. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; See Kant, Logik §§ 75–76 . Krug, Logik, § 82. —ED." See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity ''X'', if ''X'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''X'' exists.
*For every event ''E'', if ''E'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''E'' occurs.
*For every proposition ''P'', if ''P'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''P'' is true.

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of ''reasons'' or ''causes,'' for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration|date=March 2016}}, however, depending on which interpretation is given.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to [[axiom]]s within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system

|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;. 
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be [[deductive reasoning|deducible]] from the set axioms at the base of the construction (with some theoretical exceptions: see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]]).

==Leibniz's view==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the [[law of identity]] (and the [[principle of contradiction]]): "Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhit|first=Abdul|title=Leibniz on Necessary and Contingent Truths|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/AFJ/article/download/12936/9300|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction.&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"/&gt;

Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of [[infinitary]] reasons, to which [[God]] had access but humans did not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=G. W. Leibniz:  Philosophical Essays|year=1989|publisher=Hackett |location=Indianapolis|editors=Ariew, Roger and Daniel Garber, eds and trans}}, p. 94, ''On Freedom'' (1689?).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of [[closed system]], in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of [[Buridan's ass]].  Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17147 ''Theodicy'', pg. 150])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of [[absolute space and time|absolute space]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space.  Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=H.G. |title=The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence |date=1956 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised [[laws of thought]], that held a place in European [[pedagogy]] of [[logic]] and [[reasoning]] (and, to some extent, [[philosophy]] in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of [[Leo Tolstoy]], amongst others, in the elevated form that [[history]] could not be accepted as [[random]].

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called ''necessary conditions'').&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T. Hobbes, ''Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum'', 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, [[On the Freedom of the Will]], c. 4. See also: [[John Bramhall]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions.

===Hamilton's fourth law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here is how [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]], circa 1837–1838,&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface: "The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837–8)." The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by "—ED." by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his "fourth law" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:"'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, – ED.&lt;ref&gt;From the index: "SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T." These are philosophers [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] (23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug]] (22 June 1770 – 12 January 1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:"'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science."

==Schopenhauer's Four Forms==
{{main|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason}}
According to [[Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; "I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings "must be produced by an act of will which has a motive." As his proposition in 43 states, "Motivation is causality seen from within."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed proofs of universal validity==
{{See also|Free will#Free will and views of causality|label 1=Views of causality (from the article on free will)}}
Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least ''in general'', in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. The two famous arguments or proofs were proposed by Immanuel Kant (from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and "directionality" of time) and by Arthur Schopenhauer (by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect).

Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an "arrow of time") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), ''backwards'' causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the [[paradox of free will]] (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''self-model''' is the central concept in the theory of [[consciousness]] called the '''self-model theory of subjectivity''' ('''SMT'''). This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of [[consciousness]] and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR).&lt;ref name="pmid18166398"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzinger T. |title=Empirical perspectives from the self-model theory of subjectivity: a brief summary with examples |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=168 |pages=215–45 |year=2008 |pmid=18166398 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)68018-2 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-53050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Metzinger]] advanced the theory in his 1993 book ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell'' (Subject and self-model).&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1993). ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell''. Paderborn: Schoningh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the PSM==
The PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership.&lt;ref name="Being No One"&gt;Being No One&lt;/ref&gt; The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Being No one&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves.  These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.

==Role of the prefrontal cortex==
The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the [[parietal lobe]]s, unity and the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10487788"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogeley K. |author2=Kurthen M. |author3=Falkai P. |author4=Maier W. |title=Essential functions of the human self model are implemented in the prefrontal cortex |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–63 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10487788 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to psychopathology==
Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[depersonalization]]. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to [[theory of mind]] deficits and [[weak central coherence theory]]. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in [[narcissism]].&lt;ref name="pmid10993669"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ben Shalom D |title=Developmental depersonalization: the prefrontal cortex and self-functions in autism |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=457–60 |date=September 2000 |pmid =10993669 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2000.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">In the [[security engineering]] subspecialty of [[computer science]], a '''trusted system''' is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce).

The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, [[malware|malicious]] or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

==Trusted systems in classified information==

A subset of trusted systems ("Division B" and "Division A") implement [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing [[classified information]]. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's "Yellow Book" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]-style "trusted systems" is the notion of a "[[reference monitor]]", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper-proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s 1983 [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC), or "Orange Book", a set of "evaluation classes" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not ''size'', as often cited) of the [[trusted computing base]] (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy.

An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of "correctness" with that of "trustworthiness".

In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes&amp;mdash;the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards&amp;mdash;the more recently introduced [[Common Criteria]] (CC)&amp;mdash;which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various [[NATO]] countries&amp;mdash;provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven "evaluation classes" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the "target of evaluation" (TOE) and support&amp;mdash;even encourage&amp;mdash;an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined "protection profiles." While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a "chain of evidence" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of [[classified information]] derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the [[Bell-LaPadula model]], in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of '''objects''' (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and '''subjects''' (active entities&amp;mdash;perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users&amp;mdash;that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a "history" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows.

At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with "lattice-based information flows" in computer systems. (A mathematical "lattice" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either "dominates," "is dominated by," or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of "labels"&amp;mdash;corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, ''e.g.'', TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO&amp;mdash;that are attached to entities.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report&amp;mdash;entitled, ''Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation''&amp;mdash;whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the "simple security property" (a subject can only read from an object that it ''dominates'' [''is greater than'' is a close enough&amp;mdash;albeit mathematically imprecise&amp;mdash;interpretation]) and the "confinement property," or "*-property" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as "no-read-up" and "no-write-down," respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow "downhill" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the  no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], one of the most general classes of attack (''sciz.'', the popularly reported [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[viruses]] are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces "confidentiality," or "secrecy," controls, ''i.e.'', they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of "integrity"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects)  and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, [[Biba_Model|K. J. Biba]]. Other integrity models include the [[Clark-Wilson model]] and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, "The SeaView Model"&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa &amp; Denning, Dorothy &amp; R. Schell, Roger &amp; Heckman, Mark &amp; R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model (Source)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed [[discretionary access control]]s(DACs), '''are''' under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as [[File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation|permission bits]] (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and&amp;mdash;in a more flexible and powerful form&amp;mdash;by Multics since earlier still) and [[access control list|access control lists (ACLs)]] are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model&amp;mdash;which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints&amp;mdash;that takes the form of a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) with state criteria, state [[transition constraint]]s, a set of "operations" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a [[Multiple_single-level#Cross-domain_solutions|descriptive top-level specification]] (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible [[interface (computing)|interface]] (''e.g.'', an [[API]], a set of [[system call]]s [in [[UNIX]] parlance] or [[Exit_(system_call)|system exit]]s [in [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==

The [[Trusted Computing Group]] creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==

Trusted systems in the context of [[national security|national]] or [[homeland security]], [[code enforcement|law enforcement]], or [[social control]] policy are systems in which some conditional [[prediction]] about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.89 The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence], Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trusted systems include the use of "security envelopes" in national security and counterterrorism applications, "[[trusted computing]]" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of [[credit score|credit or identity scoring]] systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or [[Probabilistic risk assessment|risk analysis]] is used to assess "trust" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems [[Integrity constraints|constraints]] to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which [[deviation analysis (computing)|deviation analysis]] or systems [[surveillance]] is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of [[criminal justice]] based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur – see [[Cesare Beccaria]], On Crimes and Punishment (1764) – to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative [[surveillance]] and control through system constraints – see [[Michel Foucault]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975, [[Alan Sheridan]], tr., 1977, 1995).

In this emergent model, "security" is geared not towards [[policing]] but to [[risk management]] through [[surveillance]], exchange of information, [[auditing]], communication, and [[Categorization|classification]].  These developments have led to general concerns about individual [[privacy]] and [[civil liberty]] and to a broader [[philosophical]] debate about the appropriate forms of [[social control|social governance]] methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==

Trusted systems in the context of [[information theory]] is based on the definition of trust as ''''Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel'''' by Ed Gerck.&lt;ref name="Trust Points"&gt;Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) ''Trust Points'', in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}; [http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Information Theory]], information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.  Trust is not taken  in the purely subjective sense either,  nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system  to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance"&gt;[http://nma.com/papers/it-trust-part1.pdf Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I], The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, {{ISSN|1071-6327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together in the model of Information Theory, '''information is what you do not expect''' and '''trust is what you know'''. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as  '''qualified reliance on received information'''. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, John D. (1997). [http://pages.ca.inter.net/~euclid1/call.html John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication?]&lt;/ref&gt; The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, L. (1998). [http://www.borea.nu/index.asp?PAGE=1&amp;ARTICLE=1&amp;saID=78 Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction?] Umeå: Boréa. {{ISBN|91-89140-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leads to conceptions of information where the "quality" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]]  (1972). [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/diss-avh.html Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems].The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance" /&gt;

The [[IBM]] Federal Software Group &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher"&gt;Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's [http://issaa.org/documents/ ISSAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726192910/http://issaa.org/documents/ |date=2011-07-26 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that &lt;ref name="Trust Points" /&gt; provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher" /&gt; to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.
