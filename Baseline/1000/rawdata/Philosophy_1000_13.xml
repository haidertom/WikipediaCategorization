*"The current world is in a state of chaos, but that's understandable, since humans have got a lot less organized, more stupid, and more populous".
*"The building was coming down anyway."

In philosophy, '''animalism''' is a theory according to which humans are animals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Olson (2007) ''What are we?: a study in personal ontology'', Oxford University Press, section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt; Brian Garrett, ''Personal Identity and Self-Consciousness''.

'''Cartesian anxiety''' refers to the notion that, since [[René Descartes]] posited his influential form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-mind dualism]], Western [[civilization]] has suffered from a longing for [[ontology|ontological]] certainty, or feeling that [[scientific method]]s, and especially the study of the world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging [[knowledge]] of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on "mind" as different from "body", "[[self]]" as different from "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]". 

[[Richard J. Bernstein]] coined the term in his 1983 book ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis''.

'''Casualism''' is the philosophical view that the universe, its creation and development is solely based on [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/casualism "Casualism"], Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be traced back to [[Epicurus]] (341 BCE – 270 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/1533.html|title=Kirchner: Kasualismus|website=Textlog.de|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however most of the original sources dealing with the concept have been lost and most material today is based on [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s  work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (c. 3rd century CE), and copies plus developments by [[Titus Lucretius Carus|Lucretius]] (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE) and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]] (3 January 106 BCE – 7 December 43 BCE).&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ "Epicurus"], Plato.Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualism assumes the universe came into existence as a random event, and was not created by any omnipotent entity. Followers have therefore often been accused of [[atheism]]. Casualism has certain atheistic traits, but none of the ancient philosophers denied the existence of gods.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicurus postulates that the gods simply stay out of the day-to-day running of the universe and are not even aware of the existence of man.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; The philosophy is based on observations of well known natural phenomena, such as ocean waves or the random fall of rain drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/785?msg=welcome_stranger|title=On the Nature of Things by Titus Lucretius Carus|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2018|website=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casualism is the concept of randomness as a philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2245">In [[philosophy]], a '''causal chain''' is an [[ordered sequence]] of [[Event (philosophy)|events]] in which any one event in the chain causes the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4583/4583-h/4583-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg E-text of Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, by David Hume |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers{{who|date=June 2012}} believe causation relates facts, not events, in which case the meaning is adjusted accordingly.

Some philosophers {{who|date=September 2016}} believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass-energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say).  There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists.  The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics.  Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon [[counterfactual definiteness]], that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B.  It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects [[counterfactual definiteness]] for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).

A  '''chaordic organization''' refers to a [[system]] of organization that blends characteristics of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[:wikt:order|order]]. The term was coined by [[Dee Hock]], the founder and former CEO of the [[VISA]] credit card association.

The mix of chaos and order is often described as a harmonious coexistence displaying characteristics of both, with neither chaotic nor ordered behavior dominating. The chaordic principles have also been used as guidelines for creating human organizations -- [[business]], [[nonprofit]], [[government]] and hybrids—that would be neither centralized nor anarchical networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">The balance of '''Competing goods''' is a philosophical problem involving the acknowledgement of multiple social values that may at times conflict with one another.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&amp;pg=PA465&amp;dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&amp;f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

Conscious evolution refers to the ability of the human species to choose what the species [[Homo sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] will become in the future, based on recent advancements in science, medicine, technology, psychology, sociology, and spirituality. Most leading thinkers in this area have focused on the conscious evolution of how we think, live, organize ourselves, work together, and address issues, rather than on [[evolution|biological evolution]]. 

The idea of conscious evolution is not a specific theory, but it has loose connections to [[Ervin László|integral theory]], [[Spiral Dynamics]], and [[noosphere]] thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/conscious-evolution-save-humanity-planet/|title=Eco-Futurist Creates Revolutionary 10 Point Plan To Save Humanity &amp; The Planet|date=2015-11-28|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes connected to the theory of the [[global brain]] or [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some have suggested “conscious cultural-evolution”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-04-01|title=Accounting’s contribution to a conscious cultural evolution: an end to sustainable development|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045235403000236|journal=Critical Perspectives on Accounting|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=185–208|doi=10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00023-6|issn=1045-2354}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate term, to reduce association with standard [[Evolution|biological evolution]], though this is not widely applied.

Conscious evolution suggests that now that humanity is conscious of its history and of how things evolve (evolutionary consciousness), and given the rapid pace of change in society and culture, humanity can (and should) choose advancement through co-operation, co-creation and sustainable practices over self-destruction through separateness, competition, and ecological devastation.

== Conscious Evolution - A Mechanism ==

At the centre of the concept of conscious evolution are the approximate definitions of the term’s constituent phenomena ('[[consciousness]]' and '[[evolution]]'). However, the term implies more than these phenomena generally encompass, not least as it is often used with strong assumptions of a collective interest/ common good.

Evolution does not exclusively act upon [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] ([[Phenotype|phenotypic]]) variation; it can also work on a cognitive level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that evolution is simply a process which uses [[natural selection]] as a basic [[algorithm]] for progression.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=0-684-82471-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied to changes in behaviours, practices, concepts, theories and ideas ([[cultural evolution]]). In these situations the mutating [[The Selfish Gene#"Replicators"|replicators]] of evolution can be considered [[Meme|memes]] (theoretical units of cultural information)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The selfish gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[Gene|genes]]. Over the last 10,000 years humanity is increasingly capable of influencing its own environment and cognitively adapting to these environmental changes through the use of evolving [[Meme|memes]]. [[Memetics|Memetic]] (cognitive) innovation (as opposed to morphological variation) has therefore become the primary driver of humanity’s [[Evolution|evolutionary success]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Humans are ‘[[Consciousness|conscious]]’, and are consciously manipulating the [[Meme|memes]] they use. Consciousness itself (in humans’ brains) can therefore be said to have agency over its own evolution, because [[Memetics|memetic]] usage influences evolutionary success. Evolution is also something humans are conscious of. Consciousness (in human brains) can therefore be simultaneously conscious of evolution (working in this case upon [[Meme|memes]]) while consciously manipulating its own [[memetics]], in order to influence its own [[evolution]]. Evolution (in the sense of its impact upon [[memetics]]) is therefore increasingly a subject of knowledge, rather than an unknown pressure operating on the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banathy|first=Bela H.|date=2003-01-16|title=Self-guided/conscious evolution|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sres.506|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–321|doi=10.1002/sres.506|issn=1092-7026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscious Evolution - Writers and Thinkers ==

Conscious evolution is largely the output of several luminaries’ personal evolutionary journeys&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/|title=8/15 – Integral Conscious Evolution - Integral Leadership Review|last=Taborga|first=Jorge|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The central objective is to achieve a globally sustainable future by developing the idea that humans can guide evolution, now that we are conscious of it (evolutionary consciousness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Owing to the broad definition of the term, numerous writers and thinkers, from a range of fields and backgrounds have contributed ideas to the concept of conscious evolution. These include; [[Erich Jantsch]], [[Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Jonas Salk]], [[Ervin Laszlo]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihaly]], [[Bela H. Banathy]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], [[David Bohm#Consciousness and thought|David Bohm]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Duane Elgin]], [[Brian Swimme]], [[Ken Wilber]], [http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/ Jorge Taborga] and others.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase 'conscious evolution' may be that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] in 1918: ''"Conscious evolution means giving less and less place to herd instinct and more to the group imperative. We are emerging from our gregarious condition and are now to enter on the rational way of living by scanning our relations to one another, instead of bluntly feeling them, and so adjusting them that unimpeded progress on this higher plane is secured''.''"'' (''The New State'', p. 91)

Human evolution, has thus far been the consequence of billions of random events and chance interactions (as opposed to a planned endeavour).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolving Self: A Psychology for the New Millenium|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=M.|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans have knowledge of this evolutionary process (evolutionary consciousness) it is the task of humanity to take control of these random changes, to avoid the '[[Extinction|disastrous fate]]' (extinction) that has befallen the majority of species that have ever existed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This idea that evolutionary consciousness should be used as a tool, or even an argument for self-guided evolution, is a major central theme of the concept of conscious evolution. [[Béla H. Bánáthy|Bela H. Banathy]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; captures this sentiment succinctly in his paper ''Self guided/conscious evolution'': ''“Our consciousness of evolution becomes a springboard for leaping into conscious evolution.”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The issue then arises of how humanity can be expected to know how it should use its recently acquired evolutionary consciousness to select the best evolutionary path.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Reality: Merging Intuition and Reason|last=Salk|first=J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk|Jonas Salks]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; is optimistic that humanity is capable of merging intuition with reason in order to find the path that leads to conscious evolution: ''“It now remains for human beings to decide the ultimate course of human evolution. By imagining ourselves inside the process of evolution and by imagining the process of evolution working inside our minds, we may discover how to deal with the opportunities that might influence the direction of evolutionary choices.”''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Tom Atlee|Co-intelligence]]; a form of [[group intelligence]] that incorporates group wisdom for the benefit of humanity, is a concept [[Tom Atlee]] has stressed as an essential foundation for conscious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=2008|title=Co-intelligence, Collective Intelligence, and Conscious Evolution|url=https://co-intelligence.org/AtleeInSteeleCI-Bk.doc|journal=Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace|volume=Earth Intelligence Network|pages=5-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Atlee|Atlee]] suggested that many of the factors of [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] (wisdom, intentionality, choice, awareness) could be used as tools to enhance consciousness and improve shared circumstances. [[Eric Chaisson]] similarly identified ‘knowledge’ and ‘compassion’ as key guiding forces for the future,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Era|last=Chaisson|first=E.|publisher=The Atlantic Monthy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating in 1987 that we must “act wisely, quite beyond intelligently, in order to achieve successful ethical evolution”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson’s]] main emphasis, however, was on [[ethics]], which he argued was the most important focus for ensuring effective conscious evolution: ''“if our species is to survive to enjoy the future, then we must make synonymous the words ‘future’ and ‘ethical,’ thus terming our next evolutionary epoch ‘ethical evolution’”''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Numerous aspects of both [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] and [[ethics]], in our self-guided, conscious evolution are also present in the writings of [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], one of the most widely published advocates of conscious evolution. [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]] has a positive opinion of humanity and the evolutionary process.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conscious Evolution|last=Hubbard|first=B.|publisher=New World Library|year=1996|isbn=|location=Novato, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that: “Every tendency in us leads us toward greater wholeness, unity, and connectedness... Integration is inherent in the process of evolution.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, Hubbard has been criticised for focusing on the most hopeful evidence that conscious evolution is taking humanity in a positive direction.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/hubbard.html|title=Conscious Evolution :: A Book Review by Scott London|last=London|first=Scott|website=www.scottlondon.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott London commented in a review of her 1998 book ''Conscious Evolution; Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential'', that much of the evidence provided was ''“soft data”'', ''“highly questionable”'', or ''“anecdotal”''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite these criticisms [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]], and numerous other advocates of conscious evolution, are continuing to promote the concept, with some suggesting it be included in education and government&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[File:Norbert wiener.jpg|thumb|right|Norbert Weiner, the founder of cybernetics.]]
'''Dualism in cybernetics''' refers to systems or problems in which one or more [[intelligent]] adversaries attempt to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator. Examples could include a game-playing opponent, adversarial law, evolutionary systems of predator/parasite and prey/host, or politics/enslavement attempts. [[Norbert Wiener]], the founder of [[cybernetics]], contrasted "[[Manichean]] devils" (dualistic adversarial systems) with "[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] devils"—systems or problems that, though very complex and difficult to figure out, did not feature an adversary with contrary intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubberly.com/articles/cybernetics-and-counterculture.html|title=How cybernetics connects computing, counterculture, and design|website=www.dubberly.com|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victories or "expansions of knowledge" in the latter type of system were able to be built upon incrementally, through science (experimentation expanding empirical knowledge bases). Wiener noted that temporary weaknesses (such as errors to perceive all components of a system) were not fatal in attempts to defeat "Augustinian devils" because another experiment could simply be pursued (and he noted that he had personally defeated many "Augustinian devils" with his contributions to science and engineering). By contrast, Wiener observed that temporary lapses in judgment against "Manichean devils" were more often fatal or destructive, due to the desire of the opponent to "win/survive at all costs", even by introducing deception into the system. He said that he had been defeated by many "Manichean devils", such as on occasions when he was temporarily careless in chess.

Although this duality between complexity (in the case of the Augustinian devils) and opposition (in the case of Manichean devils) may seem obvious, it holds deep implications for many areas of science, such as [[game theory]], [[political science]], [[computer science]], [[network science]], [[Security|security science]], [[military science]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cont/ContSato.htm|title=20th WCP: The Significance of System Cybernetics for Contemporary Philosophy- Post-Modernity in System Cybernetics|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early modern philosophy''' (also '''classical modern philosophy''')&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Tlumak, ''Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. xi: "[''Classical Modern Philosophy''] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacht"&gt;[[Richard Schacht]], ''Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant'', Routledge, 2013, p. 1: "Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant".&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of philosophy]] at the beginning or overlapping with the period known as [[modern philosophy]].

==Overview==
The [[early modern period]] in history is roughly 1500–1789,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]]. 1982. ''[[All That Is Solid Melts into Air]]: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-24602-X}}. London: Verso. pp. 16–17. {{ISBN|0-86091-785-1}}. Paperback reprint New York: Viking Penguin, 1988. {{ISBN|0-14-010962-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the label "early modern philosophy" is usually used to refer to a more specific period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the [[17th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 17th century]], posited to have begun with [[René Descartes]]; to have included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]; and to have ended with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Many stretch this period to [[18th-century philosophy]] (the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), thus including [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Schacht"/&gt;

The term is sometimes used more broadly and early modern philosophy is considered to have begun in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]; to have also included [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Thomas Paine]]; and to have ended at the latest in 1804 with the death of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Considered in this way, the period spans from [[Renaissance philosophy]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''emergent''' (or '''emergentist''') '''materialism''' is a theory which asserts that the [[mind]] is an irreducible existent in some sense, albeit not in the sense of being an [[ontology|ontological]] simple, and that the study of [[mental event|mental phenomena]] is independent of other sciences.

The view can be divided into emergence which denies [[mental causation]] and emergence which allows for causal effect.  A version of the latter type has been advocated by [[John R. Searle]], called [[biological naturalism]].  
  
The other main group of materialist views in the philosophy of mind can be labeled non-emergent (or non-emergentist) materialism, and includes [[Type physicalism|identity theory (reductive materialism)]], philosophical [[behaviorism]], [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], and [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism (eliminative materialism)]].

'''Equality of sacrifice''' is a term used in [[political theory]] and [[political philosophy]] to refer to the perceived fairness of a coercive policy.

[[John Stuart Mill]] noticed that citizens often view [[tax]]ation laws as being fair, as long as taxation is also applied equally to everyone else in society.&lt;ref&gt;"As a government ought to make no distinction of persons or classes in the strength of their claims on it, whatever sacrifices it requires from them should be made to bear as nearly as possible with the same pressure upon all [...] Equality of taxation, therefore, as a maxim of politics, means equality of sacrifice." [[John Stuart Mill]]. 1848. ''[[Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]]'', p. 804 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2006747]&lt;/ref&gt; Political theorist [[Margaret Levi]] applied the term to the perceived fairness of [[conscription]] in democracies, to which citizens may consent as long as conscription is enforced as a universal duty &amp;ndash; as opposed to elitist and exceptionalist policies, as it will sometimes occur in partial [[mobilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret. 1997. ''Consent, Dissent and Patriotism''. Cambridge University Press ({{ISBN|052159961X}}) p. 26 &lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also adopted by [[Lee Iacocca]]&lt;ref&gt;Iacocca and Novak. 1984. ''[[Iacocca: An Autobiography]]''. New York: Bantam Books. Chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who, as the president of [[Chrysler]], lowered his salary to less than a dollar a year before asking union members for radical wage cuts in order to deal with the company's financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Yeon and Mai-Dalton, Renate R. 1999. "The Model of Follower's Responses To Self-Sacrificial Leadership: An Empirical Test". ''The Leadership Quarterly'', Volume 10, Issue 3 (November 18) p. 398 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W5N-3XX6KF9-F&amp;_user=789722&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000043357&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=789722&amp;md5=634ac86977034115cf258410ce309fd1]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], Iacocca's example has often been mentioned in opposition to "unconditional" government bail-out of failing companies. In a letter to the leaders of the big three U.S. automakers, Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] said that before receiving a government bailout executives should follow the example of former Chrysler head Lee Iacocca and cut their own pay:

{{cquote|Lee Iacocca essentially worked for pennies to demonstrate leadership and forcefully prove to his colleagues that he was ready to make sacrifices to reinvigorate Chrysler [...] Today’s executives could learn a lot from this example. They should take every step possible, including cutting executive salaries and bonuses, and exhaust all alternatives before coming to the taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in help.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Jason. Nov. 14, 2008. "Grassley calls on automakers to cut executive salaries". ''The Iowa Independent'' [http://iowaindependent.com/8496/grassley-calls-on-automakers-to-cut-executive-salaries] (Retrieved May 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some economists believe that the minimum wage laws in the United States lead to less equality because young black males are less likely to be able to get a job when the minimum wage is increased; this inequality exists primarily because young black workers typically live in urban areas where the food and drink industry, who mainly pay their workers minimum wage, are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Even |first=William |title=Unequal Harm: Racial Disparities in the Employment Consequences of Minimum Wage Increases |url=http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |publisher=Employment Policies Institute |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184058/http://epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=137 |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Euthymia''' ({{lang-el|εὐθυμία}}, "gladness, good mood, [[tranquillity|serenity]]", literally "good [[thumos]]") is a term used by [[Democritus]] to refer to one of the root aspects of human life's goal.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records Democritus' position as "The chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness (euthymia); which, however, he does not consider the same as pleasure; as some people, who have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant; but he understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldemocritus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s [[De Tranquillitate Animi|essay on tranquility]], he uses the Greek word ''euthymia'', which he defines as “believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iPDUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=believing+in+yourself+and+trusting+that+you+are+on+the+right+path,+and+not+being+in+doubt+by+following+the+myriad+footpaths+of+those+wandering+in+every+direction.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Je4s_cM6X6&amp;sig=EGNvhD50W_iyC5DhFDzHf7HM3G8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0KSEnbrUAhXCl5QKHVjwAo8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=believing%20in%20yourself%20and%20trusting%20that%20you%20are%20on%20the%20right%20path,%20and%20not%20being%20in%20doubt%20by%20following%20the%20myriad%20footpaths%20of%20those%20wandering%20in%20every%20direction.&amp;f=false|title=The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living: Featuring new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|last2=Hanselman|first2=Stephen|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781782833178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

A term coined by [[Karl Popper]] in his work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' to denote what he regarded as the main problem of [[methodology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], i.e. to explain and promote the further growth of scientific knowledge. To this purpose, Popper advocated his theory of [[falsifiability]], [[testability]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org 3 Population Bulletin Vol. 61, No. 2 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hedonism}}

'''Hedone''' was the personification and goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. Hedone, also known as [[Voluptas]] in Roman mythology, is the daughter of the Greek gods [[Eros]] (Cupid) and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]]. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the [[Algos]], personifications of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedone|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hedone.html|website=Theoi Greek Mythology|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hēdonē'' ({{lang|grc|ἡδονή}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning [[pleasure]], and is the root of the English word "[[wikt:hedonism|hedonism]]". In the [[Epicureanism|philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]], hēdonē is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, ''terpsis'', is always virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=Epicurus and Democritean ethics : an archaeology of ataraxia|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13282">[[Ethics]] is the branch of [[philosophy]] that examines right and wrong [[morality|moral]] behavior, moral concepts (such as justice, virtue, duty) and moral language. Various ethical theories pose various answers to the question "What is the greatest good?" and elaborate a complete set of proper behaviors for individuals and groups. Ethical theories are closely related to forms of life in various social orders.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre's Short History of Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alistair|title=A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the 20th Century|year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The epic poems that stand at the beginning of many world literatures, such as the Mesopotamian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], Homer's [[Iliad]] and the Icelandic [[Eddas]], portray a set of values that suit the strong leader of a small tribe. Valour and success are the principal qualities of a hero, and are generally not constrained by moral considerations. Revenge and vendetta are appropriate activities for heroes. The gods that appear in such epics are not defenders of moral values but are capricious forces of nature, and are to be feared and propitiated.&lt;ref&gt;T. Cahill, ''The Gifts of the Jews'' (New York, 1998), ch. 1; A. W. H. Adkins, ''Merit and Responsibility: A Study in Greek Values'' (Oxford, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

More strictly ethical claims are found occasionally in the literature of ancient civilizations that is aimed at lower classes of society. The [[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]] and the Egyptian [[Instruction of Amenhotep]] both advise farmers to leave some grain for poor gleaners, and promise favours from the gods for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' (Chicago, 1963), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ancient religions and ethical thinkers also put forward some version of the [[golden rule]], at least in its negative version: do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wattles, ''The Golden Rule'' (New York, 1996), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish ethics==
{{Further|Jewish ethics|Jewish philosophy}}

Since the origin of [[Ethical Monotheism]] in (Hebrew) Judaism, something Greek-sounding like "ethics" may be said to have been originated in Judaism's up to four thousand years old passed down traditions and instructions of the Torahs (Hebrew: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|ɔː|t|}}, ''toroth''; plural of Torah), [[Oral Torah|Oral]], [[Written Torah|Written]],&lt;ref name="Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630"&gt;Birnbaum (1979), p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalah|Mystical]].

==Ancient Greek ethics==
[[Socrates]], as portrayed in [[Plato]]'s ''Republic'', articulates the greatest good as the transcendent "form of good itself".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; The good, Socrates says, is like the sun. The sun gives light and life to the earth, the good gives knowledge and virtue to the intelligible world.  It is the cause of goodness in people and actions, and it also is the cause of existence and knowledge. The pursuit of and love of the good itself (rather than any particular good thing) Socrates thought was the chief aim of education and (especially) of philosophy.

In his personal life, Socrates lived extremely morally. He was chaste, disciplined, pious, responsible, and cared for his friends&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Symposium, Phaedo, and Republic, Book I&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]] he defends the notion that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it. The Greeks found this paradoxical, but Socrates both argued and lived this philosophy consistently. That is because the doing of evil damages the soul, which is the highest part of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Gorgias'' 475e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic, Socrates is challenged to defend the view that we have reasons to be moral that do not come from rational self-interest, in response to Glaucon's arguments in Book 2. The Republic develops the view that being a good person in an ethical sense involves achieving internal harmony of the parts of the soul. However, Plato's ethical ideal, as expressed in the [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], still has much in common with the Homeric conception of the leader of a tribe or city: the successful running of the city and the internal harmony of the citizen who runs it is the main ethical aim, and there is little mention in Plato of any strictly moral obligations the ruler may be under.

[[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotle's ethics]] builds upon Plato's with important variations. Aristotle's highest good was not the good itself but goodness embodied in a flourishing human life. His ethics are based on ''eudaimonia'', variously translated as "happiness," "prosperity," "flourishing," or "success." A "great-souled" citizen who lives a life of virtue can expect to achieve ''eudaimonia'', which Aristotle argues is the highest good for man. Following Plato, Aristotle gives a significant role in moral life the [[virtues]], fixed habits of behavior that lead to good outcomes; the main virtues are [[courage]], [[justice]], [[prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]. The highest form of life is, however, purely intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Urmson, ''Aristotle's Ethics'' (New York, 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Greek schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], debated the conditions of the good life. Epicurus taught that the greatest good was pleasure and freedom from pain. The Epicureans emphasized the quiet enjoyment of pleasures, especially mental pleasure, free of fear and anxiety. The Stoics thought the greatest good not pleasure but reason and everything in accord with reason, even if painful. Hence they praised the life of reason lived in accordance with nature.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Stephens, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/ Stoic ethics] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of Ancient Greek ethics then is the role of the virtuous life in achieving eudaimonia, or the good life; and Aristotle, Epicurus and the Stoics all argued that virtue was necessary for happiness, albeit in different ways and with different conceptions of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Morality of Happiness''. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
A passage of the [[Torah]], "[[Golden Rule#Judaism|Love your neighbour as yourself]]"&lt;ref name="njps"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=Jewish Publication Society 1917|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the writers of the [[New Testament]] and made part of the theological centerpiece of Christian ethical stance. In the New Testament Jesus teaches that all the commandments of [[Halakha|Jewish religious law]] could be summarized in the two rules, "[[Great Commandment|Love God and love your neighbour]]" (Mark 12:28-31). This is illustrated with the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], which praises action to help any human in need.

==Natural law ethics==
{{Main|Natural law}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a synthesis of Biblical and Aristotelian ethics called [[natural law]] theory, according to which the nature of humans determines what is right and wrong. For example, murder is wrong because life is essential to humans so depriving someone of it is inherently an evil. Education is needed for humans, and is their right, because their intellectual nature requires developing. Natural law theory remains at the heart of Catholic moral teaching, for example in its positions on [[contraception]] and other controversial moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;J. Finnis, ''Fundamentals of Ethics'' (Oxford, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic practice of compulsory [[Confession (religion)|confession]] led to the development of manuals of [[casuistry]], the application of ethical principles to detailed cases of conscience, such as the conditions of a [[just war theory|just war]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Jonsen and S. Toulmin, ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kantian ethics==
{{main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]], in the 18th century, argued that right and wrong are founded on [[duty]], which issues a [[Categorical Imperative]] to us, a command that, of its nature, ought to be obeyed. An action is only truly moral if done from a sense of duty, and the most valuable thing is a human will that has decided to act rightly. To decide what duty requires, Kant proposes the principle of [[universalizability]]: correct moral rules are those everyone could adopt.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnson, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/ Kant's moral philosophy] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's philosophy marks a number of important conceptual shifts in philosophical thinking about ethics. Kant argues that questions about happiness should not be a focus in ethical thought, because ethics should be universal while happiness may involve very different modes of life for different individuals. He also believed this approach was necessary if an ethical theory was to avoid becoming 'heteronomous'; that is, locating the source of proper moral motivation outside of properly moral concerns.

==Utilitarianism==
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
In 19th century Britain, [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated [[utilitarianism]], the view that right actions are those that are likely to result in the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Utilitarianism remains popular in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. P. Singer, ''Practical Ethics'' (2nd ed, Cambridge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism provide ethical theories that can support contemporary liberal political developments, and associated enlightenment ways of conceiving of the individual.

==Twentieth century==
The early twentieth century saw many debates on [[metaethics]], that is, philosophical theory on the nature of ethics. Views ranged from [[moral realism]], which holds that moral truths are about mind-independent realities,&lt;ref&gt;R. Shafer-Landau, ''Moral Realism: A Defence'' (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[evolutionary ethics]], which believes ethical practices are merely evolved ways of behavior that led to evolutionary success, to the [[error theory]] of [[J. L. Mackie]], which held that the entire notion of ethical obligation is a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mackie, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (New York, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflections on the [[Holocaust]], such as those of [[Hannah Arendt]], led to a deepening appreciation of the reality of extreme evil. Also in reaction to the Holocaust, [[rights]] theories, as expressed for example in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], asserted the inalienable moral rights of humans to life, education, and other basic goods. Another response to the atrocities of World War II included existential reflections on the meaning of life, leading to approaches to ethics based on "the situation" and personal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Ethics of Ambiguity''. Citadel, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw the revival of casuistry in the form of [[applied ethics]], the consideration of detailed practical cases in [[bioethics]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Martensen, The history of bioethics: an essay review, ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' 56 (2001), 168-175.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[business ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;T.F. McMahon, A brief history of American business ethics, in R. Frederick, ed, ''A Companion to Business Ethics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2002, pp. 342-52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[environmental ethics]] and other such special fields. The development of new medical technologies such as [[IVF]] and [[stem cell controversy|stem cell]] research produced many new issues requiring ethical debate.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}

In [[philosophy]], '''hyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|iː}}; from {{lang-grc|ὕλη}}) refers to [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] or stuff.  It can also be the [[material cause]] underlying a change in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy. The Greeks originally had no word for matter in general, as opposed to raw material suitable for some specific purpose or other, so Aristotle adapted the word for "wood" to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, James Morris Whiton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;lpg=PA829&amp;ots=xudfug-SqS&amp;dq=liddell%20and%20scott%20hyle&amp;pg=PA725#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''A lexicon abridged from Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English lexicon''] (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1891), 725.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that everything physical is made of the same basic substance holds up well under modern [[science]], although it may be thought of more in terms of [[energy]] or matter/energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Physical Existence|first=Ivor|last= Leclerc|publisher=Routledge|year= 2004|ISBN=0-415-29561-0|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substance==

The matter of hyle is closely related to that of [[substance theory|substance]], in so far as both endure a change in form, or transformation. Aristotle defined primary substance as that which can neither be predicated nor attributed to something else,&lt;ref name="sep-substance"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Howard |last=Robinson |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2009 |title=Substance |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/substance/#AriAccSub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he explained the transformation between the [[classical elements|four terrestrial elements]] in terms of an abstract primary matter that underlies each element due to the four combinations of two properties: hot or cold and wet or dry. He stipulated that transformations between opposing elements, where both properties differ, must be analyzed as two discrete steps wherein one of the two properties changes to its contrary while the other remains unchanged (see [[essence]] and [[hylomorphism]]).

Modern substance theory differs, for example [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "Ding an sich", or "[[thing in itself]]", is generally described as whatever is its own cause, or alternatively as a thing whose only property is that it is that thing (or, in other words, that it has only that property). However, this notion is subject to the criticism, as by [[Nietzsche]], that there is no way to ''directly'' prove the existence of any thing which has no properties, since such a thing could not possibly interact with other things and thus would be unobservable and [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate]].

On the other hand, we may need to postulate a substance that [[endurantism|endures]] through change in order to explain the nature of change—without an enduring factor that persists through change, there is no change but only a succession of unrelated [[event (philosophy)|event]]s. The existence of change is hard to deny, and if we have to postulate something ''unobserved'' in order to explain what ''is'' observed, that is a valid ''indirect'' demonstration (by [[abductive reasoning]]). Moreover, something like a prime substance is posited by [[physics]] in the form of [[matter]]/[[energy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inductionism''' is the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] where laws are "[[induction (philosophy)|induced]]" from sets of data.  As an example, one might measure the strength of electrical forces at varying distances from charges and induce the [[inverse square law]] of [[electrostatics]].

In [[philosophy of science]], '''intertheoretic reduction''' occurs when a reducing theory makes predictions that perfectly or almost perfectly match the predictions of a reduced theory, while the reducing theory explains or predicts a wider range of phenomena under more general conditions. [[general relativity|Special relativity]],  for example, can be reduced to  [[Newtonian mechanics]] for velocities far less than ''[[Speed of light|c]]''.

According to [[Alexander Rosenberg]] philosophers mostly these days believe that reduction between sciences is possible ''in principle'' but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which [[natural science]]s are involved, for instance from [[biology]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rosenberg - Philosophy of Social Science, second edition, page 140, published in 1995 by Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the extent to which one theory can be said to be reduced to another theory is complicated by the existence of [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. Furthermore, there is the issue of by what criteria one judges one theory as more fundamental than another. Often, this notion is ambiguous. For instance, a quintessential example of intertheoretic reduction is often considered to be the reduction of [[phenomenological thermodynamics]] to [[statistical mechanics]]. However, it has been argued that there are some phenomena (e.g. phase transitions and critical phenomena) that cannot be reductively explicated in terms of the "more fundamental" theory of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Batterman, Robert (2009) Emergence, Singularities, and Symmetry Breaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially [[psychology]] is seen often as a "scientific dead-end" due to its intentional concepts (though psychology does not necessarily have to use intentional concepts). Logical analysis has suggested that intentional concepts are not reducible to non-intentional concepts used by [[neurophysiology]] in which is the discipline "underlying" the psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg's book, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jindřich Zelený''' (13 November 1922 &amp;ndash; 11 September 1997) (translation: '''Henry Green''') was a [[Czech (people)|Czech]] philosopher and the author of several books.

==Early years==
He was born in [[Bítovany]], [[Czech Republic]] in 1922 and attended school in [[Chrudim]] and [[Hradec Králové]]. In 1948, Zeleny received a Ph.D. in philosophy and sociology from [[Charles University in Prague]].&lt;ref name="Sobotka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cs&amp;u=http://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/scf/komplet/zeleny.html&amp;ei=EHgoSp7pJI_EMfS8jIsF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Jind%25C5%2599ich%2BZelen%25C3%25BD%2522%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN|title=Henry Green|last=Sobotka|first=M.|year=1997|work=Reminiscence on the south-west, FC .|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Zelený taught at Charles University, VŠPHV, University of Economics, and [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (CSAV) FU. In 1981, he was admitted to the CSAV.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

Most of his work is published in the [[Czech language]].  However, ''The logic of Marx'', translated into [[English language]] and edited by [[Terrell Carver]], was published in 1980. ''Die Wissenschaftslogik bei Marx und "Das Kapital"'' was published 1968 in the [[German language]].

==Later years==
Zelený retired from teaching in 1990, and died in [[Prague]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

'''Lysander Spooner''' (January 19, 1808&amp;nbsp;– May 14, 1887) was an American [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[essay]]ist, [[Pamphleteer|pamphlet writer]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Jurisprudence|legal theorist]], and entrepreneur of the nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of the labor movement and severely anti-authoritarian and individualist in his political views.

Spooner's most famous writing includes the seminal abolitionist book ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', and ''[[No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority]]'' which opposed treason charges against secessionists. He is also known for competing with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] with his [[American Letter Mail Company]], which closed after legal problems with the federal government.

==Life overview==
Spooner was born on a farm in [[Athol, Massachusetts]], on January 19, 1808, and died on May 14, 1887, in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker]], "Our Nestor Taken From Us."&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner advocated what he called [[Natural law|Natural Law]]{{spaced ndash}} or the "Science of Justice"{{spaced ndash}} wherein acts of initiatory [[coercion]] against individuals and their property, such as [[tax]]ation, were considered criminal because they were immoral while the so-called criminal acts that violated only man-made (arbitrary) legislation were not necessarily criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander, [https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf Natural Law, or the Science of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
{{Libertarianism sidebar}}

===Legal career===
Spooner's activism began with his career as a lawyer, which itself violated Massachusetts law.&lt;ref&gt;p. viii, Introduction in The Lysander Spooner Reader, ed. George H.

With the encouragement of his legal mentors, Spooner set up his practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] after only three years, defying the courts.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He regarded the three-year privilege for college graduates as a state-sponsored discrimination against the poor and also providing a monopoly income to those who met the requirements. He argued that "no one has yet ever dared advocate, in direct terms, so monstrous a principle as that the rich ought to be protected by law from the competition of the poor".&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; In 1836, the legislature abolished the restriction.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt; He opposed all licensing requirements for lawyers, doctors or anyone else that was prevented from being employed by such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |title=Biography |publisher=LysanderSpooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630071436/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/5 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent a person from doing business with a person without a professional license he saw as a violation of the natural [[Freedom of contract|right to contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander [https://books.google.com/books?id=L8Q7AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22natural+right+to+contract%22+license&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2#v=onepage Constitutional Law, Relative to Credit, Currency and Banking], pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

After a disappointing legal career and a failed career in real estate speculation in [[Ohio]], Spooner returned to his father's farm in 1840.&lt;ref name=McKivigan/&gt;

===American Letter Mail Company===
Being an advocate of [[self-employment]] and opponent of government regulation of business, Spooner started his own business called [[American Letter Mail Company]] which competed with the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]]. Postal rates were notoriously high in the 1840s,&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |title=The Challenge To The U.S. Postal Monopoly, 1839–1851 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510175038/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n1-1.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1844, Spooner founded the American Letter Mail Company, which had offices in various cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and New York.&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, John Bach. 1910. A History of the People of the United States. D. Appleton and Company. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps could be purchased and then attached to letters which could be sent to any of its offices. From here agents were dispatched who traveled on railroads and steamboats, and carried the letters in hand bags. Letters were transferred to messengers in the cities along the routes who then delivered the letters to the addressees.

This was a challenge to the United States Post Office's [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name="Cato" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adie, Douglas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPmIGtrxXb0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22lysander+spooner%22+%22post+office%22+monopoly&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lysander%20spooner%22%20%22post%20office%22%20monopoly Monopoly Mail: the Privatizing United States Postal Service], pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; As he had done when challenging the rules of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]], he published a [[pamphlet]] titled "The Unconstitutionality of the Laws of Congress Prohibiting Private Mails". Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |title=Spooner vs. U.S. Postal System |first=Lucille J. |last=Goodyear |work=''lysanderspooner.org; originally published in'' American Legion Magazine |date=January 1981 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019155313/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolitionism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Spooner attained his greatest fame as a figure in the abolitionist movement. His most famous work, a book titled ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', was published in 1845. Spooner's book contributed to a controversy among abolitionists over whether the [[United States Constitution]] supported the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The "disunionist" faction, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], argued the Constitution legally recognized and enforced the oppression of slaves (as, for example, in the provisions for the capture of fugitive slaves in Article IV, Section 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Barnett |first1=Randy E. |authorlink=Randy Barnett |title=Whence Comes Section One? The Abolitionist Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment |date=2010-02-22 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1538862 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |location=Rochester, NY |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Donald Yacovone, Massachusetts Historical Society: "A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell" |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Wendell Phillips disputed Spooner's notion that any unjust law should be held legally void by judges.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Wendell.  ''[https://archive.org/details/reviewoflysander00lcphil Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner challenged the claim that the text of the Constitution permitted slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |title=The Unconstitutionality of Slavery |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728111559/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he recognized that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had probably not intended to outlaw slavery when writing the Constitution, he argued that only the meaning of the text, not the private intentions of its writers, was enforceable. Spooner used a complex system of legal and natural law arguments in order to show that the clauses usually interpreted as supporting slavery did not, in fact, support it, and that several clauses of the Constitution prohibited the states from establishing slavery.&lt;ref name=UOS/&gt; Spooner's arguments were cited by other pro-Constitution abolitionists, such as [[Gerrit Smith]] and the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], which adopted it as an official text in its 1848 platform. [[Frederick Douglass]], originally a Garrisonian disunionist, later came to accept the pro-Constitution position, and cited Spooner's arguments to explain his change of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Douglass, "[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the publication of this book until 1861, Spooner actively campaigned against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |title=Letters by Lysander Spooner |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630074426/http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published subsequent pamphlets on [[Jury nullification]] and other legal defenses for escaped slaves and offered his legal services, often free of charge, to fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2181&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, ''An Essay on the Trial by Jury'' (1852) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1850s, copies of his book were distributed to members of Congress sparking some debate over their contents. Even Senator [[Albert G. Brown|Albert Gallatin Brown]] of [[Mississippi]], a slavery proponent, praised the argument's intellectual rigor and conceded it was the most formidable legal challenge he had seen from the abolitionists to date. In 1858, Spooner circulated a "Plan for the Abolition of Slavery", calling for the use of [[guerrilla warfare]] against slaveholders by black slaves and non-slaveholding free Southerners, with aid from Northern abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/LS-PAS.htm |title=Lysander Spooner – Plan for the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner also "conspir[ed] with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to promote a servile insurrection in the South", and participated in an aborted plot to free Brown after his capture following the failed raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (Harper's Ferry is now part of the state of [[West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=Raico&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spooner had advocated the use of violence to abolish slavery, he denounced the Republicans' use of violence to prevent the Southern states from seceding during the [[American Civil War]]. He published several letters and pamphlets about the war, arguing that the Republican objective was not to eradicate slavery, but rather to preserve the Union by force. He blamed the bloodshed on Republican political leaders, such as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who often criticized slavery but would not attack it on a constitutional basis, and who pursued military policies seen as vengeful and abusive.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2233&amp;Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, Letter to Charles Sumner (1864) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo87.html |title=Spooner's Fiery Attack on Lincolnite Hypocrisy by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he denounced the institution of slavery, Spooner recognized the right of the [[Confederate States of America]] to secede as the manifestation of government by consent, a constitutional and legal principle fundamental to Spooner's philosophy; the Northern states, in contrast, were trying to deny the [[Southern United States|Southerners]] that right through military force.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, pp. xvii and further&lt;/ref&gt; He "vociferously opposed the Civil War, arguing that it violated the right of the southern states to secede from a Union that no longer represented them".&lt;ref name=Raico/&gt; He believed they were attempting to restore the Southern states to the Union, against the wishes of Southerners. He argued that the right of the states to secede derives from the natural right of slaves to be free.&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org"/&gt; This argument was unpopular in the North and in the South after the War began, as it conflicted with the official position of both governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on economics and self-employment==
Spooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be [[Self-employment|self-employed]] so that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one, he believed that laws against high interest rates, or [[usury]], prevented those with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If a man have not capital of his own, upon which to bestow his labor, it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit, it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man, having surplus capital, to loan it to him; for the capitalist cannot, consistently with natural law, be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest, are, therefore, nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws, then, is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money, to those few, who can offer the most approved security".&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander. 1846. ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cure''. Boston: [[Bela Marsh]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses, thereby putting them in a situation where "a very large portion of them, to save themselves from starvation, have no alternative but to sell their labor to others" and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay "far below what the laborers could produce, [than] if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland May 15, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner said that there was "a prohibitory tax – a tax of ten per cent. – on all notes issued for circulation as money, other than the notes of the United States and the national banks" which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit, and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lending&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; such that: "All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another".&lt;ref&gt;quoted from Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland by Eunice Minette Schuster, ''Native American Anarchism'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism==
{{Libertarian socialism}}
[[George Woodcock]] describes Spooner's essays as an "eloquent elaboration" of [[Josiah Warren]] and the early American development of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's ideas]], and associates his works with that of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and [[William Batchelder Greene]] had been members of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne}} p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Lysander Spooner Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|''Spooner's tombstone, he is interred in the historic [[Forest Hills Cemetery]]'']]
Spooner continued to write and publish extensively during the decades following Reconstruction, producing works such as "Natural Law or The Science of Justice" and "Trial By Jury". In "Trial By Jury" he defended the doctrine of [[jury nullification]], which holds that in a free society a trial jury not only has the authority to rule on the facts of the case, but also on the legitimacy of the law under which the case is tried. This doctrine would further allow juries to refuse to convict if they regard the law by which they are asked to convict as illegitimate. He became associated with [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[anarchism|anarchist]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', which published all of his later works in serial format, and for which he wrote several editorial columns on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uncletaz.com/liberty/spooner.html |title=Lysander Spooner, Tucker &amp; Liberty |publisher=Uncletaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them. Indeed, except by his sponging capital and labour from others".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[James J. Martin|Martin, James J.]] ''Men Against the State'', pp. 173ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Spooner died on May 14, 1887, at the age of 79 in his residence, 109 Myrtle Street, Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |title=One of the Old Guard of Abolition Heroes, Dies in His Eightieth Year After a Fortnight's Illness |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718051644/http://www.lysanderspooner.org/OBIT.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] arranged his funeral service and wrote a "loving [[obituary]]", entitled "Our [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] Taken From Us", which appeared in ''Liberty'' on May 28, and predicted "that the name Lysander Spooner would be 'henceforth memorable among men'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]], [http://fff.org//explore-freedom/article/lysander-spooner-part-2/ Lysander Spooner, Part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Spooner's influence extends to the wide range of topics he addressed during his lifetime. He is remembered primarily for his abolitionist activities and for his challenge to the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]] monopoly, which had a lasting influence of significantly reducing postal rates.&lt;ref&gt;Krohn, Raymond James, [https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_3.pdf The Limits of Jacksonian Liberalism: Individualism, Dissent, and the Gospel of Andrew According to Lysander Spooner], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 21, No. 2 (Summer 2007), pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] political theory in the United States, and were often reprinted in early libertarian journals such as the ''Rampart Journal''&lt;ref&gt;"A Letter to Thomas F. Bayard," in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1965), "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority," with an introduction by James J. Martin, in ''Rampart Journal'' Vol. 1, No. 3 (Fall 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_1/3_1_7.pdf ''Natural Law, Or the Science of Justice''], reprinted in ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' (Winter 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were also a major influence on [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] and right-libertarian law professor and legal theorist [[Randy Barnett]].

In January 2004, [[Laissez Faire Books]] established the Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. The honor is awarded monthly to the most important contributions to right-libertarian literature, followed by an annual award to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&amp;helpfile=spooneraw.html |title=Lysander Spooner Award |publisher=Lfb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, LAVA created the Lysander Spooner (Book of the Year) Award, which has been awarded annually since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;LAVA [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234211/http://www.lava-apa.org/ The Libertarian, Agorist, Voluntaryist &amp; Anarchs Authors and Publishers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The LAVA Awards are held annually to honor excellence in books relating to the principles of liberty, with the Lysander Spooner Award being the grand prize award.

Spooner's ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' was cited in the 2008 Supreme Court case ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which struck down the federal district's ban on [[handgun]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], writing for the court, quotes Spooner as saying the [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] was necessary for those who wanted to take a stand against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/554/07-290/opinion.html |title=District of Columbia v. Heller 554 U. S. ____ – US Supreme Court Cases from Justia &amp; Oyez |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also cited by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his concurring opinion in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'', another firearms case, the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justice Thomas |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZC1.html |title=Mv.

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

In essence, the collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[life stance]], [[religion]], [[world view]], or [[ideology]].

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early attempts by the [[logical positivists]] grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless.&lt;ref name="Uebel2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle/|title = Vienna Circle|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Uebel|first = Thomas|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper argued that the central property of science is [[falsifiability]]. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{cite book | last = Popper | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Popper | title = The logic of scientific discovery | year = 2004|edition=reprint| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = London &amp; New York | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yq6xeupNStMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+logic+of+scientific+discovery | isbn=978-0-415-27844-7 | postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First published 1959 by Hutchinson &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G. Tobin (eds.), 2:1083–1092, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist epistemology|Feminist philosophers of science]], sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself.

Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]].

However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists.

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.

It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

#''that this objective reality is governed by natural laws'';{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "Science, at least today, assumes that the universe obeys to knoweable principles that don't depend on time or place, nor on subjective parameters such as what we think, know or how we behave."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}}  Hugh Gauch argues that science presupposes that "the physical world is orderly and comprehensible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gauch|2002|p=154}}, "Expressed as a single grand statement, science presupposes that the physical world is orderly and comprehensible.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===

A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

===Philosophy of physics===
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G. (2010). "Biocommunication and Natural Genome Editing". Dortrecht: Springer Sciences and Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena.

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Pre-theoretical belief''' has been an important notion in some areas of [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy]], especially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and older versions of “ordinary language” philosophy. It is often assumed, rightly or wrongly, that language depends on mental concepts, and that certain concepts are [[innate]]. These innate concepts provide sources of very basic linguistic competency, available to any natural language speaker that enables more complex forms of language use, including philosophical, scientific, or other types of technical language. These basic concepts, in combination, may form basic propositional attitudes about things and events. Often “pre-theoretical belief” refers to these basic propositional attitudes. Also, “pre-theoretical beliefs” may refer to simple intuitions.

''Pre-theoretic belief'' is a term used in philosophical arguments for and against [[libertarianism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balaguer|first1=Mark|title=Free will as an open scientific problem excerpt: Why There Are No Good Arguments for or against Determinism (or Any Other Thesis That Would Establish or Refute Libertarianism) ...|date=2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262319775|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6F_FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=Pre-theoretic+belief&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0H5HcHCt6L&amp;sig=IBnSZJtjrLBWskIV63cHEJqqPr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYt67tpuTXAhUKMd8KHaZVBK4Q6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Pre-theoretic%20belief&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process philosophy''' — also '''ontology of becoming''', '''processism''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Process Metaphysics: An Introduction to Process Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''philosophy of organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy Emmet]], 1932, ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism'', London: Macmillan; 2nd edn, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; — identifies [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]]. In opposition to the classical model of change as illusory (as argued by Parmenides) or accidental (as argued by Aristotle), process philosophy regards change as the cornerstone of reality—the cornerstone of [[being]] thought of as [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]].

Since the time of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], philosophers have posited true reality as "timeless", based on permanent [[Substance theory|substance]]s, while processes are denied or subordinated to timeless substances. If [[Socrates]] changes, becoming sick, Socrates is still the same (the substance of Socrates being the same), and change (his sickness) only glides over his substance: change is accidental, whereas the substance is essential. Therefore, classic [[ontology]] denies any full reality to change, which is conceived as only accidental and not essential. This classical ontology is what made knowledge and a [[theory of knowledge]] possible, as it was thought that a science of something in becoming was an impossible feat to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fagot-Largeau, [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 7 December 2006 course] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206183341/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} at the [[Collège of France]], first part of a series of courses on the "Ontology of Becoming" {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who appeal to process rather than substance include [[Heraclitus]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24196-marx-and-whitehead-process-dialectics-and-the-critique-of-capitalism/ Marx and Whitehead: Process, Dialectics, and the Critique of Capitalism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]],  [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Alfred Korzybski]], [[R. G. Collingwood]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Robert M. Pirsig]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Arran Gare]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Colin Wilson]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. In physics, [[Ilya Prigogine]]&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Prigogine, ''From being to becoming'', W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming". Process philosophy covers not just scientific intuitions and experiences, but can be used as a conceptual bridge to facilitate discussions among religion, philosophy, and science.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy R.

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to [[Continental philosophy]] than [[analytic philosophy]], because it is usually only taught in Continental departments.&lt;ref&gt;William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus Continental methods in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gaskill, A. J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and Continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

=== In ancient Greek thought ===

Heraclitus proclaimed that the basic nature of all things is change.

The quotation from [[Heraclitus]] appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' twice; in 401d as:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' Paragraph [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DCrat.%3Asection%3D401d Crat. 401 section d line 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|τὰ ὄντα ἰέναι τε πάντα καὶ μένειν οὐδέν}}&lt;br/&gt;''Ta onta ienai te panta kai menein ouden''&lt;br/&gt;"All entities move and nothing remains still"&lt;/blockquote&gt;and in 402a&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+402&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 Paragraph 402 section a line 8].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|grc|"πάντα χωρεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" καὶ "δὶς ἐς τὸν αὐτὸν ποταμὸν οὐκ ἂν ἐμβαίης"}}&lt;br/&gt;''Panta chōrei kai ouden menei kai dis es ton auton potamon ouk an embaies''
&lt;br /&gt;"Everything changes and nothing remains still&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... you cannot step twice into the same stream"&lt;ref&gt;This sentence has been translated by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] in Epistulae, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep6.shtml VI, 58, 23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus considered fire as the most fundamental element.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=William|title=Heraclitus: The Complete Philosophical Fragments|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/Philosophy/Heraclitus.html|website=Middlebury College|accessdate=3 October 2015|ref=DK B90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is an interpretation of Heraclitus's concepts into modern terms by Nicholas Rescher.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...reality is not a constellation of things at all, but one of processes.  The fundamental "stuff" of the world is not material substance, but volatile flux, namely "fire", and all things are versions thereof (puros tropai).  Process is fundamental: the river is not an object, but a continuing flow; the sun is not a thing, but an enduring fire.  Everything is a matter of process, of activity, of change (panta rhei)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=Process philosophy a survey of basic issues|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=[Pittsburgh]|isbn=0822961288|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early expression of this viewpoint is in [[Heraclitus]]'s fragments. He posits strife, ''ἡ ἔρις'' (strife, conflict), as the underlying basis of all reality defined by change.&lt;ref&gt;Wheelwright, P. (1959). ''Heraclitus'', Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, {{ISBN|0-19-924022-1}}, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The balance and opposition in strife were the foundations of change and stability in the flux of existence.

===Twentieth century===
In early twentieth century, the [[philosophy of mathematics]] was undertaken to develop mathematics as an airtight, axiomatic system in which every truth could be derived logically from a set of axioms. In the [[foundations of mathematics]], this project is variously understood as [[logicism]] or as part of the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] program of [[David Hilbert]]. [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to complete, or at least facilitate, this program with their seminal book [[Principia Mathematica]], which purported to build a logically consistent [[set theory]] on which to found mathematics. After this, Whitehead extended his interest to natural science, which he held needed a deeper philosophical basis. He intuited that natural science was struggling to overcome a traditional ontology of timeless material substances that does not suit natural phenomena. According to Whitehead, material is more properly understood as 'process'. In 1929, he produced the most famous work of process philosophy, ''[[Process and Reality]]'',&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; continuing the work begun by [[Hegel]] but describing a more complex and fluid dynamic ontology.

Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance ([[Hegelian]] truth), rather than [[substance theory|substances]] as fixed concepts or "things" ([[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] truth). Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from [[Hegel]] in that it describes entities that arise or coalesce in ''becoming'', rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as ''complexes of occasions of experience''. It is also distinguished in being not necessarily conflictual or oppositional in operation. Process may be integrative, destructive or both together, allowing for aspects of interdependence, influence, and confluence, and addressing coherence in universal as well as particular developments, i.e., those aspects not befitting Hegel's system. Additionally, instances of determinate occasions of experience, while always ephemeral, are nonetheless seen as important to define the type and continuity of those occasions of experience that flow from or relate to them.

==Whitehead's ''Process and Reality''==
[[Alfred North Whitehead]] began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925), Whitehead noted that the human intuitions and experiences of science, aesthetics, ethics, and religion influence the worldview of a community, but that in the last several centuries science dominates [[Western culture]]. Whitehead sought a holistic, comprehensive [[Cosmology (philosophy)|cosmology]] that provides a systematic descriptive theory of the world which can be used for the diverse human intuitions gained through ethical, aesthetic, religious, and scientific experiences, and not just the scientific.&lt;ref name="Hustwit"/&gt;

Whitehead's influences were not restricted to philosophers or physicists or mathematicians. He was influenced by the French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), whom he credits along with [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] in the preface to ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process metaphysics===

For Whitehead, metaphysics is about logical frameworks for the conduct of discussions of the character of the world. It is not directly and immediately about facts of nature, but only indirectly so, in that its task is to explicitly formulate the language and conceptual presuppositions that are used to describe the facts of nature. Whitehead thinks that discovery of previously unknown facts of nature can in principle call for reconstruction of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929), pp. 13, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process metaphysics elaborated in ''[[Process and Reality]]''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; posits an ontology which is based on the two kinds of existence of [[entity]], that of actual entity and that of abstract entity or [[abstraction]], also called 'object'.&lt;ref&gt;Palter, R.M. (1960). ''Whitehead's Philosophy of Science'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Actual entity''' is a term coined by Whitehead to refer to the entities that really exist in the natural world.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"&gt;Robert Audi. 1995, ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.'' Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge. 851–853.&lt;/ref&gt; For Whitehead, actual entities are spatiotemporally extended events or processes.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; An actual entity is how something is happening, and how its happening is related to other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The actually existing world is a multiplicity of actual entities overlapping one another.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

The ultimate abstract principle of actual existence for Whitehead is '''creativity'''. Creativity is a term coined by Whitehead to show a power in the world that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; Creativity is the principle of novelty.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is manifest in what can be called 'singular causality'. This term may be contrasted with the term 'nomic causality'. An example of singular causation is that I woke this morning because my alarm clock rang. An example of nomic causation is that alarm clocks generally wake people in the morning. Aristotle recognizes singular causality as [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient causality]]. For Whitehead, there are many contributory singular causes for an event. A further contributory singular cause of my being awoken by my alarm clock this morning was that I was lying asleep near it till it rang.

An actual entity is a general philosophical term for an utterly determinate and completely concrete individual particular of the actually existing world or universe of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#IX: Theta|changeable entities]] considered in terms of singular causality, about which categorical statements can be made. Whitehead's most far-reaching and radical contribution to metaphysics is his invention of a better way of choosing the actual entities. Whitehead chooses a way of defining the actual entities that makes them all alike, ''qua'' actual entities, with a single exception.

For example, for [[Aristotle]], the actual entities were the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)#Summary#Zeta|substance]]s, such as Socrates. Besides Aristotle's ontology of substances, another example of an ontology that posits actual entities is in the [[Monadology|monads]] of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], which are said to be 'windowless'.

====Whitehead's actual entities====

For Whitehead's ontology of processes as defining the world, the actual entities exist as the only fundamental elements of reality.

The actual entities are of two kinds, temporal and atemporal.

With one exception, all actual entities for Whitehead are '''temporal''' and are '''[[wiktionary:actual occasions|occasions of experience]]''' (which are not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). An entity that people commonly think of as a simple concrete [[object (philosophy)|object]], or that Aristotle would think of as a substance, is, in this ontology, considered to be a temporally serial composite of indefinitely many overlapping occasions of experience. A human being is thus composed of indefinitely many occasions of experience.

The one exceptional actual entity is at once both temporal and '''atemporal''': God. He is objectively immortal, as well as being immanent in the world. He is objectified in each temporal actual entity; but He is not an eternal object.

The occasions of experience are of four grades. The first grade comprises processes in a physical vacuum such as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave or gravitational influence across empty space. The occasions of experience of the second grade involve just inanimate matter; "matter" being the composite overlapping of occasions of experience from the previous grade. The occasions of experience of the third grade involve living organisms. Occasions of experience of the fourth grade involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy, which means more or less what are often called the [[qualia]] of subjective experience. So far as we know, experience in the mode of presentational immediacy occurs in only more evolved animals. That some occasions of experience involve experience in the mode of presentational immediacy is the one and only reason why Whitehead makes the occasions of experience his actual entities; for the actual entities must be of the ultimately general kind. Consequently, it is inessential that an occasion of experience have an aspect in the mode of presentational immediacy; occasions of the grades one, two, and three, lack that aspect.

There is no [[Mind-body dualism|mind-matter duality]] in this ontology, because "mind" is simply seen as an abstraction from an occasion of experience which has also a material aspect, which is of course simply another abstraction from it; thus the mental aspect and the material aspect are abstractions from one and the same concrete occasion of experience. The brain is part of the body, both being abstractions of a kind known as ''persistent physical objects'', neither being actual entities. Though not recognized by Aristotle, there is biological evidence, written about by [[Galen]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. E. (1973). ''Galen: On Psychology, Psychopathology, and Function and Diseases of the Nervous System. An Analysis of his Doctrines, Observations, and Experiments'', Karger, Basel, {{ISBN|978-3-8055-1479-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the human brain is an essential seat of human experience in the mode of presentational immediacy. We may say that the brain has a material and a mental aspect, all three being abstractions from their indefinitely many constitutive occasions of experience, which are actual entities.

=====Time, causality, and process=====

Inherent in each actual entity is its respective dimension of time. Potentially, each Whiteheadean occasion of experience is causally consequential on every other occasion of experience that precedes it in time, and has as its causal consequences every other occasion of experience that follows it in time; thus it has been said that Whitehead's occasions of experience are 'all window', in contrast to Leibniz's 'windowless' monads. In time defined relative to it, each occasion of experience is causally influenced by prior occasions of experiences, and causally influences future occasions of experience. An occasion of experience consists of a process of prehending other occasions of experience, reacting to them. This is the process in process philosophy.

Such process is never deterministic. Consequently, [[free will]] is essential and inherent to the universe.

The causal outcomes obey the usual well-respected rule that the causes precede the effects in time. Some pairs of processes cannot be connected by cause-and-effect relations, and they are said to be [[Spacetime#Basic concepts#Space-like interval|spatially separated]]. This is in perfect agreement with the viewpoint of the Einstein theory of [[special relativity]] and with the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski geometry]] of spacetime.&lt;ref name="Naber"&gt;Naber, G. L. (1992). ''The Geometry of Minkowski Spacetime. An Introduction to the Mathematics of the Special Theory of Relativity'', Springer, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-387-97848-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Whitehead respected these ideas, as may be seen for example in his 1919 book ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge''&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1919"&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1919). ''An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Natural Knowledge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Process and Reality]]''. Time in this view is relative to an inertial reference frame, different reference frames defining different versions of time.

=====Atomicity=====

The actual entities, the occasions of experience, are logically '''atomic''' in the sense that an occasion of experience cannot be cut and separated into two other occasions of experience. This kind of logical atomicity is perfectly compatible with indefinitely many spatio-temporal overlaps of occasions of experience. One can explain this kind of atomicity by saying that an occasion of experience has an internal causal structure that could not be reproduced in each of the two complementary sections into which it might be cut. Nevertheless, an actual entity can completely contain each of indefinitely many other actual entities.

Another aspect of the atomicity of occasions of experience is that they do not change. An actual entity is what it is. An occasion of experience can be described as a process of change, but it is itself unchangeable.

The reader should bear in mind that the atomicity of the actual entities is of a simply logical or philosophical kind, thoroughly different in concept from the natural kind of atomicity that describes the [[atom]]s of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

=====Topology=====

Whitehead's theory of extension was concerned with the spatio-temporal features of his occasions of experience. Fundamental to both Newtonian and to quantum theoretical mechanics is the concept of velocity. The measurement of a velocity requires a finite spatiotemporal extent. Because it has no finite spatiotemporal extent, a single point of Minkowski space cannot be an occasion of experience, but is an abstraction from an infinite set of overlapping or contained occasions of experience, as explained in ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 1929"/&gt; Though the occasions of experience are atomic, they are not necessarily separate in extension, spatiotemporally, from one another. Indefinitely many occasions of experience can '''overlap''' in Minkowski space.

Nexus is a term coined by Whitehead to show the network actual entity from universe. In the universe of actual entities spread&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; actual entity. Actual entities are clashing with each other and form other actual entities.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; The birth of an actual entity based on an actual entity, actual entities around him referred to as nexus.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;

An example of a nexus of temporally overlapping occasions of experience is what Whitehead calls an '''enduring physical object''', which corresponds closely with an Aristotelian substance. An enduring physical object has a temporally earliest and a temporally last member. Every member (apart from the earliest) of such a nexus is a causal consequence of the earliest member of the nexus, and every member (apart from the last) of such a nexus is a causal antecedent of the last member of the nexus. There are indefinitely many other causal antecedents and consequences of the enduring physical object, which overlap, but are not members, of the nexus. No member of the nexus is spatially separate from any other member. Within the nexus are indefinitely many continuous streams of overlapping nexūs, each stream including the earliest and the last member of the enduring physical object. Thus an enduring physical object, like an Aristotelian substance, undergoes changes and adventures during the course of its existence.

In some contexts, especially in the [[theory of relativity]] in physics, the word 'event' refers to a single point in Minkowski or in Riemannian space-time. A point event is not a process in the sense of Whitehead's metaphysics. Neither is a countable sequence or array of points. A Whiteheadian process is most importantly characterized by extension in space-time, marked by a continuum of uncountably many points in a Minkowski or a Riemannian space-time. The word 'event', indicating a Whiteheadian actual entity, is not being used in the sense of a point event.

====Whitehead's abstractions====

Whitehead's '''abstractions''' are conceptual entities that are abstracted from or derived from and founded upon his actual entities. Abstractions are themselves not actual entities. They are the only entities that can be real but are not actual entities. This statement is one form of Whitehead's 'ontological principle'.

An abstraction is a conceptual entity that refers to more than one single actual entity. Whitehead's ontology refers to importantly structured collections of actual entities as nexuses of actual entities. Collection of actual entities into a '''nexus''' emphasizes some aspect of those entities, and that emphasis is an abstraction, because it means that some aspects of the actual entities are emphasized or dragged away from their actuality, while other aspects are de-emphasized or left out or left behind.

'Eternal object' is a term coined by Whitehead. It is an abstraction, a possibility, or pure potential. It can be ingredient into some actual entity.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; It is a principle that can give a particular form to an actual entity.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004 ({{ISBN|3-937202-49-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead admitted indefinitely many eternal objects. An example of an '''eternal object''' is a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal objects are abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal objects, are potential ingredients of processes.

====Relation between actual entities and abstractions stated in the ontological principle====

For Whitehead, besides its temporal generation by the actual entities which are its contributory causes, a process may be considered as a concrescence of abstract '''ingredient''' eternal objects. God enters into every temporal actual entity.

Whitehead's '''ontological principle''' is that whatever reality pertains to an abstraction is derived from the actual entities upon which it is founded or of which it is comprised.

====Causation and concrescence of a process====
Concrescence is a term coined by Whitehead to show the process of jointly forming an actual entity that was without form, but about to manifest itself into an entity Actual full (''satisfaction'') based on datums or for information on the universe.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt; The process of forming an actual entity is the case based on the existing datums. Concretion process can be regarded as ''subjectification process.''&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;John B. Cobb and David Ray Griffin. 1976, ''Process Theology, An Introduction. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Datum is a term coined by Whitehead to show the different variants of information possessed by actual entity. In process philosophy, datum is obtained through the events of concrescence. Every actual entity has a variety of datum.&lt;ref name="Audi (ed.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

==Commentary on Whitehead and on process philosophy==
Whitehead is not an [[idealism|idealist]] in the strict sense.{{which|date=May 2013}} Whitehead's thought may be regarded as related to the idea of [[panpsychism]] (also known as panexperientialism, because of Whitehead's emphasis on experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seager|first1=William|title=Whitehead and the Revival (?) of Panpsychism|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~seager/whitehead.htm|website=University of Toronto Scarborough|publisher=University of Toronto at Scarborough|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God ===
Whitehead's philosophy is very complex, subtle and nuanced and in order to comprehend his thinking regarding what is commonly referred to by many religions as "God", it is recommended that one read from ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'', wherein regarding "God" the authors elaborate Whitehead's conception.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is the unconditioned actuality of conceptual feeling at the base of things; so that by reason of this primordial actuality, there is an order in the relevance of eternal objects to the process of creation (343 of 413) (Location 7624 of 9706 Kindle ed.)  Whitehead continues later with, "The particularities of the actual world presuppose it ; while it merely presupposes the general metaphysical character of creative advance, of which it is the primordial exemplification (344 of 413) (Location 7634 of 9706 Kindle Edition)." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Process philosophy, might be considered according to some theistic forms of religion to give a [[God#Process theology and process philosophy definition of God|God]] a special place in the universe of occasions of experience. Regarding Whitehead's use of the term, "occasions" in reference to, "God" it is explained in ''Process and Reality Corrected Edition'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;"'Actual entities'-also termed 'actual occasions'-are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything [28] more real.  They differ among themselves: God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence in far-off empty space.  But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level.  The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It can be also be assumed within some forms of theology that a God encompasses all the other occasions of experience but also transcends them and this might lead to it being argued that Whitehead endorses some form of [[panentheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=John W.|title=Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|date=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801049316|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aokfbkOdjuEC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Whitehead++panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilv8Xpxb7UAhVGOCYKHaBCB-UQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Whitehead%20%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, it is argued theologically, that "free will" is inherent to the nature of the universe, Whitehead's God is not omnipotent in Whitehead's metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dombrowski|first1=Daniel A.|title=Whitehead's Religious Thought: From Mechanism to Organism, From Force to Persuasion|date=2017|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|location=Albany|isbn=978-1438464299|pages=33–35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACKRDQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Whitehead%27s+God+is+not+omnipotent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God's role is to offer enhanced occasions of experience. God participates in the evolution of the universe by offering possibilities, which may be accepted or rejected. Whitehead's thinking here has given rise to [[process theology]], whose prominent advocates include [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], and [[Hans Jonas]], who was also influenced by the non-theological philosopher Martin Heidegger. However, other process philosophers have questioned Whitehead's theology, seeing it as a regressive Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hustwit|first1=J. R.|title=Process Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/processp/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead enumerated three essential ''natures of God''. The ''primordial'' nature of God consists of all potentialities of existence for actual occasions, which Whitehead dubbed eternal objects. God can offer possibilities by ordering the relevance of eternal objects. The ''consequent'' nature of God prehends everything that happens in reality. As such, God experiences all of reality in a sentient manner. The last nature is the ''superjective''. This is the way in which God's synthesis becomes a sense-datum for other actual entities. In some sense, God is prehended by existing actual entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viney|first1=Donald|title=Process Theism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosoph|publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and applications ==
=== Biology ===
In [[plant morphology]], [[Rolf Sattler]] developed a process morphology (dynamic morphology) that overcomes the structure/process (or structure/function) dualism that is commonly taken for granted in biology. According to process morphology, structures such as leaves of plants do not have processes, they ''are'' processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1990. "Towards a more dynamic plant morphology". ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 38: 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1992. "Process morphology: structural dynamics in development and evolution". ''[[Canadian Journal of Botany]]'' 70: 708–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[evolution]] and in [[Developmental biology|development]], the nature of the changes of biological objects are considered by many authors to be more radical than in physical systems. In biology, changes are not just changes of state in a pre-given space, instead the space and more generally the mathematical structures required to understand object change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montévil|first=Maël|last2=Mossio|first2=Matteo|last3=Pocheville|first3=Arnaud|last4=Longo|first4=Giuseppe|date=2016-10-01|year=|title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation|url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches|volume=122|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
With its perspective that everything is interconnected, that all life has value, and that non-human entities are also experiencing subjects, process philosophy has played an important role in discourse on ecology and sustainability. The first book to connect process philosophy with environmental ethics was [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]]'s 1971 work, ''Is It Too Late: A Theology of Ecology''.&lt;ref name="Is It Too Late"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |title=Is It Too Late?: A Theology of Ecology |date=1971 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |isbn=978-0028012803 |url=https://www.amazon.com/too-late-theology-ecology/dp/0962680737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent book (2018) edited by [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] and Wm. Andrew Schwartz, ''Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization''&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Scwhartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |location=Minnesota |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributors explicitly explore the ways in which process philosophy can be put to work to address the most urgent issues facing our world today, by contributing to a transition toward an ecological civilization. That book emerged out of the largest international conference held on the theme of [[ecological civilization]] (''Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization'') which was organized by the Center for Process Studies in June 2015. The conference brought together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featured such leaders in the environmental movement as [[Bill McKibben]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], [[Wes Jackson]], and [[Sheri Liao]].&lt;ref name="conferencereport"&gt;Herman Greene, [http://www.ecozoicsocieties.org/musings/2015/re-imagining-civilization-as-ecological-report-on-the-seizing-an-alternative-toward-an-ecological-civilization-conference/ "Re-Imagining Civilization as Ecological: Report on the 'Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization' Conference"], last modified August 24, 2015, ''Center for Ecozoic Societies'', accessed November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[ecological civilization]] is often affiliated with the process philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]--especially in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Zhihe |last2=Huili |first2=He |last3=Meijun |first3=Fan |title=The Ecological Civilization Debate in China: The Role of Ecological Marxism and Constructive Postmodernism—Beyond the Predicament of Legislation |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/11/01/the-ecological-civilization-debate-in-china/ |website=Monthly Review |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], some of Whitehead's ideas re-emerged in combination with [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] as the [[cognitive science of mathematics]] and [[embodied mind]] theses.

Somewhat earlier, exploration of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] from the 1950s to 1980s had sought alternatives to [[metamathematics]] in social behaviours around [[mathematics]] itself: for instance, [[Paul Erdős]]'s simultaneous belief in [[Platonism]] and a single "big book" in which all proofs existed, combined with his personal obsessive need or decision to collaborate with the widest possible number of other mathematicians. The process, rather than the outcomes, seemed to drive his explicit behaviour and odd use of language, as if the synthesis of Erdős and collaborators in seeking proofs, creating sense-datum for other mathematicians, was itself the expression of a divine will. Certainly, Erdős behaved as if nothing else in the world mattered, including money or love, as emphasized in his biography ''[[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]''.

=== Medicine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Several fields of science and especially [[medicine]] seem {{vague|date=May 2013}} to make liberal use of ideas in process philosophy, notably the theory of [[pain]] and [[healing]] of the late 20th century. The [[Philosophy of healthcare|philosophy of medicine]] began to deviate somewhat from [[scientific method]] and an emphasis on repeatable results in the very late 20th century by embracing [[Health system|population thinking]], and a more pragmatic approach to issues in [[public health]], [[environmental health]] and especially [[mental health]]. In this latter field, [[R. D. Laing]], [[Thomas Szasz]] and [[Michel Foucault]] were instrumental in moving medicine away from emphasis on "cures" and towards concepts of individuals in balance with their society, both of which are changing, and against which no benchmarks or finished "cures" were very likely to be measurable.

=== Psychology ===
In [[psychology]], the subject of imagination was again explored more extensively since Whitehead, and the question of feasibility or "eternal objects" of thought became central to the impaired [[theory of mind]] explorations that framed postmodern [[cognitive science]]. A biological understanding of the most eternal object, that being the emerging of similar but independent cognitive apparatus, led to an obsession with the process "embodiment", that being, the emergence of these [[cognition]]s. Like Whitehead's God, especially as elaborated in [[J. J. Gibson]]'s [[perceptual psychology]] emphasizing [[affordance]]s, by ordering the relevance of eternal objects (especially the cognitions of other such actors), the world becomes. Or, it becomes simple enough for human beings to begin to make choices, and to prehend what happens as a result. These experiences may be summed in some sense but can only approximately be shared, even among very similar cognitions with identical DNA. An early explorer of this view was [[Alan Turing]] who sought to prove the limits of expressive complexity of human genes in the late 1940s, to put bounds on the complexity of human [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and so assess the feasibility of [[artificial intelligence]] emerging. Since 2000, Process Psychology has progressed as an independent academic and therapeutic discipline: In 2000, [[Michel Weber]] created the Whitehead Psychology Nexus: an open forum dedicated to the cross-examination of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy and the various facets of the contemporary psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Jr. "Process Psychotherapy: Introduction". ''Process Studies'' vol. 29, no. 1 (Spring–Summer 2000): 97–102; cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and particularly [[political philosophy]], '''theoreticism''' is the preference for theory over practice (or, more broadly, abstract knowledge over concrete action), or a philosophical position which would lead to such a preference.

The term is often used pejoratively.  In [[Marxist philosophy]], for instance, theoreticism is often identified as a political error, valorizing the efforts of [[academic]] Marxism over those of revolutionary struggle.  [[Louis Althusser]], for instance, criticized his own early work for theoreticism.  In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], theoreticism would be something closer to the over-valuing of [[knowledge]] at the cost of losing a proper appreciation of [[experience]].  [[Martin Heidegger]] claimed this trend was begun by [[Plato]], and that it continued in an "intensification and hardening of 'theoreticism', the drive toward technical and objectifying modes of knowledge and, with it, the oblivion of any more primordial or more reverential kind of existence."

{{Distinguish|Transhumanism}}

'''Transcendental humanism''' in philosophy considers what is proper treatment of humans outside of nature and decides they have inherent rights, simply from being human.&lt;ref&gt;Ferry, Luc. 2002. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z2tctBZg40C&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false "Transcendental" Humanism]'' Man Made God: The Meaning of Life. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226244849}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also positive that man is capable of transcending the material self and can also free himself from surrounding influences. An example of this is when he thinks about himself and his character traits as if two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Vanheste, Jeroen. 2007. ''Guardians of the Humanist Legacy: The Classicism of T.S. Eliot's Criterion Network and Its Relevance to Our Postmodern World, Volume 26 of Philosophy of History and Culture'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lITBxOMRJFQC&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA447#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false 447] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=lITBxOMRJFQC&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false 449] Brill. {{ISBN|9004161600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant by the term meant humans are both a part of 'creation' and able to transcend reflexive obedience to the laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Henry E.|title=The Monist, Vol. 55, No. 2, Is Philosophy Human or Transcendental? |year=1971|publisher=Hegeler Institute|pages=182–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">'''Wagnerism'''  has a number of meanings:

* the [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideals put forward by [[Richard Wagner]] which indicate  the traits of a "true" [[Germany|German]], among other [[aestheticism|aesthetic]] ideas.
* an attachment, sometimes fanatical, to the music of Wagner.
* a form of adversarial [[labour union]] legislation, the [[Wagner Act]] in the [[United States]], and similarly adopted in [[Canada]], among other countries.

The first two of these aspects were promoted, often in distorted form, by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that "Germany would be impossible without Wagner and all he represents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=manuscripts |title=Hitler and Wagnerism |author=Janet Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).

{{For|the [[Snow Patrol]]|Wildness (album)}}
{{distinguish|Wilderness}}

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):
         
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|}

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Zeno's paradoxes''' are a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] problems generally thought to have been devised by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] (c. 490–430 BC) to support [[Parmenides]]' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in [[Ontological pluralism|plurality]] and change is mistaken, and in particular that [[motion (physics)|motion]] is nothing but an [[illusion]].  It is usually assumed, based on [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']] (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these [[paradox]]es because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view.  Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128d&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has [[Socrates]] claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'' 128a–b&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref name=aristotle&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.html Aristotle's ''Physics''] "Physics" by Aristotle translated by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye

and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius's]] commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them.&lt;ref name=aristotle/&gt;  Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the [[Dichotomy]] argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.

Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' also known as [[proof by contradiction]].  They are also credited as a source of the [[dialectic]] method used by Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;([fragment 65], Diogenes Laertius. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlzeno-eleatic.htm IX] 25ff and VIII 57).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians and historians, such as [[Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications  |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[philosopher]]s, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see [[Thomson's lamp]]) remain relevant [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] problems.&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft&gt;{{cite web |first=Francis |last=Moorcroft |title=Zeno's Paradox |url=http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418141459/http://www.philosophers.co.uk/cafe/paradox5.htm |archivedate=2010-04-18 }}

The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. [[Diogenes Laertius]], a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing [[Favorinus]], says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the Achilles and the tortoise paradox. But in a later passage, Laertius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.23 and 9.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradoxes of motion ==

=== Achilles and the tortoise ===
{{Redirect|Achilles and the Tortoise}}
[[File:Race between Achilles and the tortoise.gif|thumb|Distance vs. time, assuming the tortoise to run at Achilles' half speed]]

}}
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite [[time]], Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;

Suppose Homer wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before he can get there, he must get halfway there. Before he can get halfway there, he must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, he must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

The resulting sequence can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \cdots,  \frac{1}{16},  \frac{1}{8},  \frac{1}{4},  \frac{1}{2},  1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48205-7|page=33|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sequence also presents a second problem in that it contains no first distance to run, for any possible ([[wikt:finite|finite]]) first distance could be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all. Hence, the trip cannot even begin. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an [[illusion]]. An alternative conclusion, [[Duration (philosophy)#Responses to Kant and Zeno|proposed]] by [[Henri Bergson]], is that motion (time and distance) is not actually divisible.

This argument is called the ''[[Dichotomy]]'' because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains some of the same elements as the ''Achilles and the Tortoise'' paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the '''Race Course''' paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of ''Achilles and the Tortoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Dic |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.1 The Dichotomy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrow paradox ===
[[File:Zeno Arrow Paradox.png|thumb|The arrow]]

{{quote|If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html#752 |work=The Internet Classics Archive |title=Physics |author=Aristotle |quote=Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|as recounted by [[Aristotle]], [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] VI:9, 239b5}}

In the arrow paradox (also known as the '''[[fletching|fletcher's]] paradox'''), Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_IX#Pyrrho | first=Diogenes |last=Laertius |authorlink=Diogenes Laërtius | title=[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]] | volume=IX |chapter=Pyrrho  |at= passage 72 | year=c. 230| isbn=1-116-71900-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring.  If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#Arr |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.3 The Arrow |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three other paradoxes as given by Aristotle ==

=== Paradox of Place ===
From Aristotle:
{{quote
|If everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html ''Physics'' IV:1, 209a25]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Paradox of the Grain of Millet ===
Description of the paradox from the ''Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy'':
{{quote
|The argument is that a single grain of [[millet]] makes no sound upon falling, but a thousand grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something, an absurd conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Proudfoot, A.R. Lace. Routledge Dictionary of Philosophy. Routledge 2009, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's refutation:
{{quote
|Zeno is wrong in saying that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise than potentially.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.7.vii.html ''Physics'' VII:5, 250a20]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Description from Nick Huggett:
{{quote
|This is a [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] argument that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to be that even inaudible sounds can add to an audible sound.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, Nick, "Zeno's Paradoxes", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Moving Rows (or Stadium) ===
[[File:Zeno Moving Rows Paradox.png|thumb|The moving rows]]From Aristotle:
{{quote
|... concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This...involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html ''Physics'' VI:9, 239b33]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For an expanded account of Zeno's arguments as presented by Aristotle, see [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius']] commentary ''On Aristotle's Physics''.

== Proposed solutions ==

=== Diogenes the Cynic ===
According to [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], [[Diogenes the Cynic]] said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions (see ''[[solvitur ambulando]]''). To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC−322 BC) remarked that as the distance decreases, the time needed to cover those distances also decreases, so that the time needed also becomes increasingly small.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Aristotle's observation that the fractional times also get shorter does not guarantee, in every case, that the task can be completed. One case in which it does not hold is that in which the fractional times decrease in a [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], while the distances decrease geometrically, such as: 1/2 s for 1/2 m gain, 1/3 s for next 1/4 m gain, 1/4 s for next 1/8 m gain, 1/5 s for next 1/16 m gain, 1/6 s for next 1/32 m gain, etc. In this case, the distances form a convergent series, but the times form a [[divergent series]], the sum of which has no limit. Archimedes developed a more explicitly mathematical approach than Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle also distinguished "things infinite in respect of divisibility" (such as a unit of space that can be mentally divided into ever smaller units while remaining spatially the same) from things (or distances) that are infinite in extension ("with respect to their extremities").&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. Physics 6.9; 6.2, 233a21-31&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle's objection to the arrow paradox was that "Time is not composed of indivisible nows any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.6.vi.html |title=Physics |volume=VI |at=Part 9 verse: 239b5 |isbn=0-585-09205-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;!-- please do not change to Saint Thomas Aquinas, see [[MOS:SAINTS]] --&gt; commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote "Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. Commentary on Aristotle's Physics, Book 6.861
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
Before 212 BC, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller. (See: [[Geometric series]], [[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]], ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''.) Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods (see [[convergent series]], where the "reciprocals of powers of 2" series, equivalent to the Dichotomy Paradox, is listed as convergent). These methods allow the construction of solutions based on the conditions stipulated by Zeno, i.e. the amount of time taken at each step is geometrically decreasing.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Thomas, ''Calculus and Analytic Geometry'', Addison Wesley, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bertrand Russell ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] offered what is known as the "at-at theory of motion". It agrees that there can be no motion "during" a durationless instant, and contends that all that is required for motion is that the arrow be at one point at one time, at another point another time, and at appropriate points between those two points for intervening times. In this view motion is a function of position with respect to time.&lt;ref name=HuggettBook&gt;{{ cite book |title=Space From Zeno to Einstein |first=Nick |last=Huggett |year=1999 |isbn=0-262-08271-3 }}

Salmon | page=198 |isbn=978-0-19-510864-4 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nick Huggett ===
Nick Huggett argues that Zeno is [[begging the question|assuming the conclusion]] when he says that objects that occupy the same space as they do at rest must be at rest.&lt;ref name=HuggettArrow/&gt;

=== Peter Lynds ===
Peter Lynds has argued that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are resolved by the conclusion that instants in time and instantaneous magnitudes do not physically exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1197/|title=Zeno's Paradoxes: A Timely Solution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lynds, Peter. Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics: Indeterminacy vs. Discontinuity. Foundations of Physics Letter s (Vol. 16, Issue 4, 2003). doi:10.1023/A:1025361725408
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time’s Up Einstein"&gt;
[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/physics.html Time’s Up Einstein], Josh McHugh, [[Wired Magazine]], June 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lynds argues that an object in relative motion cannot have an instantaneous or determined relative position (for if it did, it could not be in motion), and so cannot have its motion fractionally dissected as if it does, as is assumed by the paradoxes. For more about the inability to know both speed and location, see [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

=== Hermann Weyl ===
Another proposed solution is to question one of the assumptions Zeno used in his paradoxes (particularly the Dichotomy), which is that between any two different points in space (or time), there is always another point. Without this assumption there are only a finite number of distances between two points, hence there is no infinite sequence of movements, and the paradox is resolved. The ideas of [[Planck length]] and [[Planck time]] in modern physics place a limit on the measurement of time and space, if not on time and space themselves. According to [[Hermann Weyl]], the assumption that space is made of finite and discrete units is subject to a further problem, given by the "[[Weyl's tile argument|tile argument]]" or "distance function problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Bendegem|first=Jean Paul|title=Finitism in Geometry|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/geometry-finitism/#SomParSolProDea|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-01-03|date=17 March 2010 }}

According to this, the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to the length of one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]] has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that discretization can therefore remove the paradox.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=187807 |title=Discussion:Zeno's Paradoxes and the Tile Argument |first=Jean Paul |last=van Bendegem |location= Belgium |year=1987 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=295–302|doi=10.1086/289379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The paradoxes in modern times ==
Infinite processes remained theoretically troublesome in mathematics until the late 19th century. The [[Ε-δ definition|epsilon-delta]] version of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] developed a rigorous formulation of the logic and calculus involved. These works resolved the mathematics involving infinite processes.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Harold | title=Are Zeno's Paradoxes Based on a Mistake? |jstor=2251675 |year=1965 |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=74 |issue=296 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages= 563–570 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIV.296.563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|B Russell]] (1956) ''Mathematics and the metaphysicians'' in "The World of Mathematics" (ed.

While mathematics can calculate where and when the moving Achilles will overtake the Tortoise of Zeno's paradox, philosophers such as Brown and Moorcroft&lt;ref name=KBrown&gt;{{cite web

claim that mathematics does not address the central point in Zeno's argument, and that solving the mathematical issues does not solve every issue the paradoxes raise.

Popular literature often misrepresents Zeno's arguments. For example, Zeno is often said to have argued that the sum of an infinite number of terms must itself be infinite–with the result that not only the time, but also the distance to be travelled, become infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Benson|first= Donald C.|title= The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies|year= 1999|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0195117219|page= 14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A humorous take is offered by [[Tom Stoppard]] in his play Jumpers (1972), in which the principal protagonist, the philosophy professor George Moore, suggests that according to Zeno’s paradox, [[Saint Sebastian]], a 3rd Century Christian saint supposedly martyred by being shot with arrows, died of fright.  However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series. Simplicius has Zeno saying "it is impossible to traverse an infinite number of things in a finite time". This presents Zeno's problem not with finding the ''sum'', but rather with ''finishing'' a task with an infinite number of steps: how can one ever get from A to B, if an infinite number of (non-instantaneous) events can be identified that need to precede the arrival at B, and one cannot reach even the beginning of a "last event"?&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMoorcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Papa-G /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ZenInf |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 5. Zeno's Influence on Philosophy |year=2010 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continues on the question of whether or not Zeno's paradoxes have been resolved. In ''The History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2010) Burton writes, "Although Zeno's argument confounded his contemporaries, a satisfactory explanation incorporates a now-familiar idea, the notion of a 'convergent infinite series.'".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, David, ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', McGraw Hill, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offered a "solution" to the paradoxes based on the work of [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |date=2002 |title=Our Knowledge of the External World: As a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy |chapter=Lecture 6. The Problem of Infinity Considered Historically |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |orig-year=First published in 1914 by The Open Court Publishing Company |isbn=0-415-09605-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Brown concludes "Given the history of 'final resolutions', from Aristotle onwards, it's probably foolhardy to think we've reached the end. It may be that Zeno's arguments on motion, because of their simplicity and universality, will always serve as a kind of [[Rorschach test|'Rorschach image']] onto which people can project their most fundamental phenomenological concerns (if they have any)."&lt;ref name=KBrown/&gt;

==A similar ancient Chinese philosophic consideration==
[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient Han Chinese]] philosophers from the [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] during the [[Warring States period|Warring States period of China (479-221 BCE)]] independently developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. The scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', describes an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] paradox from the surviving [[School of Names|Mohist School of Names]] book of logic which states, in the [[archaism|archaic]] [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese script]], "a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted." Several other paradoxes from this philosophical school (more precisely, movement) are known, but their modern interpretation is more speculative.

== Quantum Zeno effect ==
{{Main article|Quantum Zeno effect}}

In 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |bibcode=1977JMP....18..756M |last=Sudarshan |first=E. C. G. |authorlink=E. C. G.

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and B. Misra discovered that the dynamical evolution (motion) of a quantum system can be hindered (or even inhibited) through observation of the system.&lt;ref name="u0"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/858.pdf |format=PDF |author1=W.M.Itano |author2=D.J.

&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is usually called the "quantum Zeno effect" as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno's arrow paradox. This effect was first theorized in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |last=Khalfin |first=L.A. |author-link=   |journal=Soviet Phys. JETP |volume=6 |page=1053 |year=1958 |url= |doi=   |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |bibcode = 1958JETP....6.1053K  |title=Contribution to the Decay Theory of a Quasi-Stationary State }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zeno behaviour ==
In the field of verification and design of [[timed event system|timed]] and [[hybrid system]]s, the system behaviour is called ''Zeno'' if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.&lt;ref name="Fishwick2007"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Paul A.  Fishwick | title=Handbook of dynamic system modeling | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cM-eFv1m3BoC&amp;pg=SA15-PA22 | accessdate=2010-03-05 | edition=hardcover | series=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Computer and Information Science | date=1 June 2007 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA | isbn=978-1-58488-565-8 | pages=15–22 to 15–23 | chapter=15.6 "Pathological Behavior Classes" in chapter 15  "Hybrid Dynamic Systems: Modeling and Execution" by Pieter J.  Mosterman, The Mathworks, Inc. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[formal verification]] techniques exclude these behaviours from analysis, if they are not equivalent to non-Zeno behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamport |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |year=2002 |title=Specifying Systems |format=PDF |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-14306-X |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book-02-08-08.pdf |page=128 |accessdate=2010-03-06 }}

In [[systems design]] these behaviours will also often be excluded from system models, since they cannot be implemented with a digital controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Henzinger |first2=Thomas |last1=Franck |first1=Cassez |first3=Jean-Francois |last3=Raskin |url=http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |title=A Comparison of Control Problems for Timed and Hybrid Systems |year=2002 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528193234/http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/Publications/a_comparison_of_control_problems_for_timed_and_hybrid_systems.html |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
