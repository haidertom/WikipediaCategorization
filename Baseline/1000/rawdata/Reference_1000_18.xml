[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]

An '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brevis/breve, brevis M – Latin is Simple Online Dictionary|url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/adjective/91/|website=www.latin-is-simple.com|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'', or ''abbrev.''

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[crasis]], [[acronym]]s, or [[initialism]]s, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&amp;dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&amp;q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&amp;q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&amp;f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.

== History ==
{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abbreviations%20history&amp;f=false ''The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography'', Wm. S. Orr and Company, 1838, p.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, ''A'' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as ''ager'', ''amicus'', ''annus'', ''as'', ''Aulus'', ''Aurelius'', ''aurum'' and ''avus''.)"&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;dq=abbreviations++fashionable&amp;q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&amp;f=false ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome''], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' used many abbreviations, for example ''7'' or ''&amp;'' for ''and'', and ''y'' for ''since'', so that "not much space is wasted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviations%20beowulf&amp;f=false Gelderen, E. v, ''A History of the English Language: Revised edition'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483–1660&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015214606/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php |date=October 15, 2007 }} Doesn't work.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for ''master'' and ‹exacɔbate› for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{quote|Mastɔ subwardenɔ y ɔmēde me to you. And wherɔ y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differrɔ thelectionɔ ovɔ to quīdenaɔ tinitatis y have be thougħt me synɔ that itt woll be thenɔ a bowte mydsomɔ.}}

The [[Early Modern English]] period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' for ''Þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', used for the word ''the'': "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."&lt;ref&gt;Lass, R., ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, Vol. 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185657/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does "OK" stand for? |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "[[Special Operations, Executive]]"—"S.O., E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Twitter, a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

== Style conventions in English ==

In modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

=== Lowercase letters ===

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for ''Leviticus''. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for ''year-to-date'', PCB for ''printed circuit board'' and FYI for ''for your information''. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===
[[File:“To Penna. R.R. Station”.jpg|thumb|Sign in New York City subway, reading “Penna.” for Penn''sylvani''a, showing American style of including the period even for contractions.]]
A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to [[Hart's Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="harts"/&gt;{{rp|p167–170}} [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. ''Dr.'' or ''Mrs.''. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either ''US'' or ''U.S.'' for  ''United States'', ''EU'' or ''E.U.'' for ''European Union'', and ''UN'' or ''U.N.'' for ''United Nations''. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:
* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, ''"Northwest Blvd"'', ''"W. Jefferson"'', and ''"PED XING"'' all follow this recommendation.) 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are "[[Numéro sign|No.]]" (to avoid the appearance of "[[yes and no|No]]"); initials within persons' names (such as "George R. Smith"); and "St." within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as "Emily R. St. Clair") (but not in city names such as ''St Louis''  or ''St Paul''). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U.&amp;nbsp;S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: ''The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C''.

=== Plural forms ===

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation".  Also, the [[American Psychological Association]] specifically says,&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'', 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of [[run batted in]], simply add an s to the end of RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RBIs

For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase ''s'' to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.
* A group of MPs
* The roaring 20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb or 20&amp;nbsp;lb
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft or 16&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, ''Hart's Rules'' recommends putting the ''s'' after the final one.
* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* the d.t.s
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:
* PhDs
* MPhils
* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the ''New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors''.)

According to ''Hart's Rules'', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x's of the equation
* Dot the i's and cross the t's
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The ''x''s of the equation
* Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===

==== United States ====

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and the [[Associated Press]].{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.

==== United Kingdom ====

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops—see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''"US"'', not ''"U.S."'');
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''"PR"'', instead of ''"p.r."'', or ''"pr"'')
** Names (''"FW de Klerk"'', ''"GB Whiteley"'', ''"Park JS"'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''"Mr F. W. de Klerk"''.
** Scientific units (see Measurement below).
* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''"Nato"'' or ''"NATO"'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''"Sars"'' or ''"SARS"'' (compare with ''"[[laser]]"'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the ''"British Broadcasting Corporation"'' is abbreviated to ''"BBC"'', never ''"Bbc"''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (&lt;nowiki&gt;100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C&lt;/nowiki&gt;). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====

* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double "l" is a separate sound: "Ll. George" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].
* Some titles, such as "Reverend" and "Honourable", are spelt out when preceded by "the", rather than as "Rev." or "Hon." respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 53. New York City: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurement shorthand—symbol or abbreviation ==
[[File:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China—"km" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]

Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "[[inch]]" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "[[kilometre]]/kilometer".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary
|publisher = Oxford University Press
|year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies the appropriate shorthand by ''substitution'' rather than by ''contraction''. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (''[[:pt:Quilômetro|quilômetro]]'' in Portuguese or ''[[:el:Χιλιόμετρο|χιλιόμετρο]]'' in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:
*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1&amp;nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;mW (milliwatts).
*No periods should be inserted between letters—for example "m.s" (which is an approximation of "m·s", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for "metres multiplied by seconds", but "ms" is the symbol for milliseconds.
*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter "s" to denote a plural.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==
&lt;!--irony is this is linked from the MOS on how not to do it like this! - see [[MOS:CAPSACRS]]--&gt;
A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

=== Usage ===

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Com'''munications'') and [[Oftel]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Tel'''ecommunications'') use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as [[Tribeca]] ('''''Tri'''angle '''be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street'') and [[SoHo]] ('''''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street''). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]], San Francisco ('''''So'''uth of '''Ma'''rket'') and [[LoDo, Denver]] ('''''Lo'''wer '''Do'''wntown''), among others.

==== Languages other than English====

On the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the ''[[Comintern]]'' (''Communist International'') and ''[[Komsomol]]'' ('''''Kom'''munisticheskii '''So'''yuz '''Mol'''odyozhi'', or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell's [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei'', and are still used, e.g. ''[[:de:Kripo|Kripo]]'' for ''[[:de:Kriminalpolizei|Kriminalpolizei]]''.

In the modern Russian language words like ''Minoborony'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''oborony''' — Ministry of Defence) and ''Minobrnauki'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''obr'''azovaniya i '''nauki''' — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for '''''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit'' ("state security", the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], from the name of the founder, Theo '''Al'''brecht, and the German word '''''Di'''skont'' (discount) or [[Haribo]], from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, '''Ha'''ns '''Ri'''egl '''Bo'''nn.

Syllabic abbreviations are ''de rigueur'' in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as [[Pemex]] for '''''Pe'''tróleos '''Mex'''icanos'' ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for '''''Fo'''ndo '''Na'''cional de '''Fi'''nancimiento '''Fo'''restal'' (National Forestry Financing Fund).

East Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in Japanese the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai rengō'' (国際連合) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (国連). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:略語|ryakugo]] (略語) in Japanese; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''Běidà'' (北大) for ''Běijīng Dàxué'' (北京大学, [[Peking University]]) and ''Tōdai'' (東大) for ''Tōkyō daigaku'' (東京大学, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase "[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

==== Organizations ====
{{See also|Neologism}}

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

'''Abbreviations''' in music are of two kinds, namely, [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology|abbreviations of terms]] related to [[musical expression]], and the true musical abbreviations by the help of which certain passages, chords, etc., may be notated in a shortened form, to the greater convenience of both composer and performer. Abbreviations of the first kind are like most [[abbreviation]]s in language; they consist for the most part of the initial letter or first syllable of the word employed—as for instance, {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or {{serif|'''''f'''''}} for the [[dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]] piano and forte, ''cresc.'' for [[crescendo]], ''Ob.'' for [[oboe]], ''Fag.'' for [[bassoon]] ({{lang-it|fagotto}}). This article is about abbreviations used in [[music notation]]. For abbreviations of terms related to musical expression and music in general, see [[Glossary of musical terminology]].

==Repetition of a single note or chord==
The continued repetition of a note or chord is expressed by a stroke or strokes across the [[stem (music)|stem]], or above or below the note if it be a [[whole note]] or [[double whole note]]. The number of strokes denotes the subdivision of the written note into [[eighth note]]s, [[sixteenth note]]s, etc., unless the word [[tremolo]] or tremolando is added, in which case the repetition is as rapid as possible, without regard to the exact number of notes played. (When strokes are added to notes shorter than a quarter note, each beam counts as a stroke.) In the first bar of the example below, the half note with the single stroke across the stem in the ''written'' staff becomes 4 eighth notes in the ''played'' staff. Through the use of 2 strokes across the stem in the second bar, the next full note is expressed as a phrase of 16 sixteenth notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \new staff { c2:8^\markup { Written: } &lt;e c g&gt;: | c1:16 | \time 2/4 f,2:32 | \time 4/4 f4:8 a:8 c:16 f:16 | b,8:16 d:16 b:16 g:16 a:32 b:32 c:32 d:32 \bar "|." } \new staff { c8^\markup { Played: } c c c &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; &lt;e c g&gt; | c16 c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c | f,32 f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f | f8 f a a c16 c c c f f f f | b, b d d b b g g a32 a a a b b b b c c c c d d d d } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

On [[bowed instruments]] the rapid reiteration of a single note is easy, but in [[piano]] music an octave or chord becomes necessary to produce a tremolo, the manner of writing and performing of which is seen below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { &lt;g g'&gt;4:16 ^\markup { \italic tremolo } &lt;e' c g&gt;:16 | \repeat tremolo 4 { &lt;c e&gt;16^\markup { \italic tremolo } g } | s4 } \new staff { g'32*8/12 g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, &lt;c e&gt;32*8/12 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | &lt;c e&gt;32 g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g &lt;c e&gt; g | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

In the abbreviation expressed by strokes, as above, the passage to be abbreviated can contain no note of greater length than an eighth note, but it is possible also to divide a long note into quarter notes, by means of dots (sometimes known as ''divisi'' dots) placed over it, as below.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c2^\markup { .. } c2^\markup { .. } | c1^\markup { .... } | s2 } \new staff { c4 c c c | c c c c | s2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This is however seldom done, as only a small amount of space is saved. When a long note has to be repeated in the form of [[tuplet|triplets or sextuplets]], the figure 3 or 6 is usually placed over it in addition to the stroke across the stem, and the note is sometimes, though not necessarily, written dotted.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c4:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } c2:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } \bar "||" \time 4/4 \omit TupletNumber \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\markup { \smaller { \italic 3 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\markup { \smaller { \italic 6 } } } \bar "||" } \new staff { \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c c c c c c c} | \tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c} \tuplet 6/4 4 {c16 c c c c c c c c c c c} } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Alternation of two notes==

The repetition of a group of two notes is abbreviated by two notes (most often [[half note]]s or [[whole note]]s) connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half note requires two half notes to express it, on account of the group consisting of two notes.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 2 { f8 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { f16 a} | \repeat tremolo 4 { f8 a } | s4 } \new staff { f8 a f a f16 a f a f a f a | f8 a f a f a f a | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

As seen above, half notes are often written with the strokes beaming the notes together (which is unambiguous as white notes with beams are not otherwise used in music), but with quarter notes and shorter the strokes must be separated from the stems to prevent them being misread as a shorter note value.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new staff { \repeat tremolo 4 { c32 a } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 c } \repeat tremolo 4 { g64 b } | s4 } \new staff { c32 a c a c a c a g64 [c g c g c g c] g [b g b g b g b] | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Patterns of groups of three or more notes==

A group of three, four, or more notes is abbreviated by the repetition of the cross strokes without the notes as many times as the group has to be repeated.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e8[ g c g] } | \repeat percent 4 { e16 g c g } \bar "||" } \new staff { e8 g c g e g c g | e16 g c g e g c g e g c g e g c g } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

This can also be written with the notes forming the group are written as a chord, with the necessary number of strokes across the stem. In this case the word ''simili'' or ''segue'' is added, to show that the order of notes in the first group (which must be written out in full) is to be repeated, and to prevent the possibility of mistaking the effect intended for the repetition of the chord as a whole.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { d16 f a f &lt;d f a&gt;2.:16^\markup { \italic simili } | s4 } \new staff { d16 f a f d f a f d f a f d f a f | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Repetition marks==

Another sign of abbreviation of a group consists of an oblique line with two dots, one on each side; this serves to indicate the repetition of a group of any number of notes of any length. This can even apply to a passage composed of several groups, provided such passage is not more than two bars in length.

:&lt;score&gt;
\relative c' &lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new staff { \repeat percent 2 { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } \bar "||" } \new staff { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f | e g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

A more usual method of abbreviating the repetition of a passage of the length of the above is to write over it the word ''bis'' (twice), or in some cases ''ter'' (three times), or to enclose it between the dots of an ordinary [[repeat sign]].

==Passages in octaves==
{{main|Octave}}
Passages intended to be played in octaves are often written as single notes with the words ''coll' ottava'' or ''coll' 8va'' placed above or below them, according as the upper or lower octave is to be added.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 2/4 \new Staff { c''8^\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } d'' e'' f'' \bar "||" \clef bass g_\markup { \smaller { \italic "coll' 8" \super \italic "va" } } e c4 \bar "||" s4 } \new Staff { &lt;c'' c'''&gt;8 &lt;d'' d'''&gt; &lt;e'' e'''&gt; &lt;f'' f'''&gt; | \clef bass &lt;g g,&gt; &lt;e e,&gt; &lt;c c,&gt;4 | s4 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

The word ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' (or sometimes ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; alta'' or ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa'') written above or below a passage does not add octaves, but merely transposes the passage an octave higher or lower. In [[clarinet]] music the word ''[[chalumeau]]'' is used to signify that the passage is to be played an octave lower than written.

:&lt;score&gt;
&lt;&lt; { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \time 4/4 \new Staff { \ottava #1 f'''8 e''' d''' c''' \ottava #0 b''^\markup { \smaller \italic loco } a'' g''4 \bar "||" \clef bass \ottava #-1 a,,8 b,, c, d, \ottava #0 e_\markup { \smaller \italic loco } f g4 \bar "||" \clef treble \ottava #-1 \set Staff.ottavation = #"chalumeau" e8 g c' g f a c' a | g \ottava #0 e'_\markup { \smaller \italic clar. } g' c'' e''2 \bar "||" } \new Staff { f'''8 e''' d''' c''' b'' a'' g''4 | \clef bass a,,8 b,, c, d, e, f, g,4 | \clef treble e8 g c' g f a c' a | g e' g' c'' e''2 } &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

All these alterations (which can scarcely be considered abbreviations except that they spare the use of [[ledger line]]s) are counteracted, and the passage restored to its usual position, by the ending of the enclosing bracket, the word ''loco'', or in clarinet music ''clarinette''.

==Abbreviations in scores==

In [[orchestra]]l music it often happens that certain of the instruments play in [[unison]]; when this is the case the parts are sometimes not all written in the score, but the lines belonging to one or more of the instruments are left blank, and the words ''coi violini'' or ''col basso'', etc., are added, to indicate that the instruments in question have to play in unison with the violins or basses, as the case may be, or when two instruments of the same kind, such as first and second violins, have to play in unison, the word ''unisono'' or ''col primo'' is placed instead of the notes in the line belonging to the second. Where two parts are written on one staff in a score the sign ''[[a due|a 2]]'' denotes that both play the same notes; and ''a 1'' that the second of the two is resting. The indication ''a 3'' or ''a 4'' at the head of [[fugue]]s indicates the number of parts or voices in which the fugue is written.

An abbreviation which is often very troublesome to the conductor occurs in [[manuscript]] scores, when a considerable part of the composition is repeated without alteration, and the corresponding number of bars are left vacant, with the remark ''come sopra'' (as above). This is not met with in printed scores.

==Chord abbreviations used in music theory==
[[Image:Scale degree numbers.png|thumb|350px|Root position triads of the C major scale indicated using [[Roman numeral analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Jonas|Jonas, Oswald]] (1982). ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker'' (1934: ''Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einführung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers''), p.22. Trans. John Rothgeb. {{ISBN|0-582-28227-6}}. Shown all uppercase.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Root position triads from C major scale.mid|Play}}]]

There are also abbreviations relating to [[music analysis]], some of which are of great value. In [[figured bass]], for instance, the various chords are expressed by figures, and the several authors in the nineteenth century invented or availed themselves of various methods of shortly expressing the different chords and intervals, particularly using [[Roman numeral analysis]].

[[Gottfried Weber]] represents an interval by a number with one or two dots before it to express [[minor chord|minor]] or [[Diminished triad|diminished]], and one or two after it for [[major chord|major]] or [[augmented chord|augmented]].

[[Johann Anton André]] makes use of a [[right triangle]] to express a [[triad (music)|triad]], and a [[square]], for a [[seventh chord]], the inversions being indicated by one, two, or three small vertical lines across their base, and the classification into major, minor, diminished, or augmented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, placed in the centre.

{{Selfref|For the use of acronyms on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Acronyms]].}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}

An '''acronym''' is a [[word]] or name formed as an [[abbreviation]] from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in ''[[NATO]]'' or ''[[laser]]'') and sometimes syllables (as in ''[[Benelux]]'').

There are no universal standards for the [[#Nomenclature|multiple names for such abbreviations]] or for their [[#Orthographic styling|orthographic styling]]. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of [[word formation]] process, and they are viewed as a subtype of [[Blend word|blend]]ing.

==Nomenclature==

Whereas an [[abbreviation]] may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, ''Rd'' for ''road'' or ''Dr'' for ''[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]''), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as ''[[sonar]]'', created from ''{{uu|so}}und {{uu|na}}vigation and {{uu|r}}anging''). Attestations for ''{{lang|de|Akronym}}'' in German are known from 1921, and for ''acronym'' in English from 1940.&lt;ref name="Paris_Gazette_and_Brockhaus_Handbuch"&gt;
Paris Gazette, by Lion Feuchtwanger; translated (from Exil) by Willa and Edwin Muir, New York, Viking Press, 1940. Chapter 47, Beasts of Prey, pp.{{nbsp}}665–66:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His first glance at the ''Paris German News'' told Wiesener that this new paper was nothing like the old ''P.G.''. "They can call it the ''P.G.N.'' if they like", he thought, "but that's the only difference. Pee-gee-enn; what's the word for words like that, made out of initials? My memory is beginning to fail me. Just the other day there was a technical expression I couldn't remember. I must be growing old. "''P.G.'' or ''P.G.N.'', it's six of one and half a dozen of the other.... Pee-gee-enn. It's an acronym, that's what it is. That's what they call words made up of initials. So I remember it after all; that's at least something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For "Akronym" used in 1921 or 1922, giving an example of "Agfa" film: Brockhaus Handbuch des Wissens in vier Bänden. Leipzig, F. A. Brockhaus, [1922–23, c1921–23] v.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Initialisms}}Although the word ''acronym'' is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters,&lt;ref name="MWDEU"&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc. ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-87779-132-5}}. pp. 21–22:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''acronyms'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A number of commentators (as Copperud 1970, Janis 1984, Howard 1984) believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The powder metallurgy industry has officially adopted the acronym 'P/M Parts'"—''Precision Metal Molding'', January 1966.&lt;br /&gt;"Users of the term ''acronym'' make no distinction between those pronounced as words ... and those pronounced as a series of characters" —Jean Praninskas, ''Trade Name Creation'', 1968.&lt;br /&gt;"It is not J.C.B.'s fault that its name, let alone its acronym, is not a household word among European scholars"—''Times Literary Supp.'' 5 February 1970.&lt;br /&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the confusion in the Pentagon about abbreviations and acronyms—words formed from the first letters of other words"—Bernard Weinraub, ''N.Y.

The distinction is not well-maintained. According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'':&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; "A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... ''Initialism'', an older word than ''acronym'', seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with ''acronym'' in a narrow sense."  About the use of ''acronym'' to only mean those pronounced as words, ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'' (3rd ed.) states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |edition=Third Revised |editor-first=R.

Such terms are also called ''initialisms''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, ''acronym'' is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called ''initialisms''."

A clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles &amp; Algeo (1970),&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; who divided ''acronyms'' as a general category into ''word acronyms'' pronounced as words, and ''initialisms'' sounded out as letters.&lt;!--Better to obtain and cite the original source rather than MW's summary of it, but it's good enough for now per [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT]].--&gt;

There is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as ''[[JPEG]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|p|ɛ|ɡ}} and ''[[MS-DOS]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|m|ɛ|s|ˈ|d|ɒ|s}}.  There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms ''[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]'' and ''[[Individual Retirement Account|IRA]]'' can be pronounced as individual letters: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|juː|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|ɛ|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|eɪ}}, respectively; or as a single word: {{IPAc-en|ɜːr|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|r|ə}}, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Historical and current use==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Acronymy, like [[retronym]]y, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no [[Metalanguage|naming]], conscious attention, or [[Linguistics|systematic analysis]] until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.

Ancient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was [[metalanguage]] at the time to describe it) include the following:
* Acronyms were used in Rome before the Christian era. For example, the official name for the Roman Empire, and the Republic before it, was abbreviated as ''[[SPQR]]'' (''{{lang|la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}''). Inscriptions dating from antiquity, both on stone and on coins, use a lot of abbreviations and acronyms to save room and work. For example, [[praenomen|Roman first names]], of which there was only a small set, were almost always abbreviated. Common terms were abbreviated too, such as writing just "F" for ''{{lang|la|filius}}'', meaning "son of", a very common part of memorial inscriptions mentioning people. Grammatical markers were abbreviated or left out entirely if they could be inferred from the rest of the text.
* So-called ''{{lang|la|[[nomina sacra]]}}'' were used in many Greek biblical manuscripts. The common words "God" ({{lang|grc|Θεός}}), "Jesus" ({{lang|grc|Ιησούς}}), "Christ" ({{lang|grc|Χριστός}}), and some others, would be abbreviated by their first and last letters, marked with an overline. This was just one of many kinds of conventional scribal abbreviation, used to reduce the time-consuming workload of the scribe and save on valuable writing materials. The same convention is still commonly used in the inscriptions on religious [[icon]]s and the stamps used to mark the eucharistic bread in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]].
* The early Christians in Rome, most of whom were Greek rather than Latin speakers, used the image of a fish as a symbol for [[Jesus]] in part because of an acronym—''fish'' in Greek is ''{{transl|grc|[[ichthys]]}}'' ({{lang|grc|ΙΧΘΥΣ}}), which was said to stand for {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς Χριστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ}} (''{{transl|grc|Iesous CHristos THeou hUios Soter}}'': "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior"). This interpretation dates from the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is preserved in the [[catacombs]] of Rome. And for centuries, the Church has used the inscription ''[[INRI]]'' over the crucifix, which stands for the Latin ''{{lang|la|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum}}'' ("Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews").
* The Hebrew language has a long history of formation of acronyms pronounced as words, stretching back many centuries. The Hebrew Bible ("Old Testament") is known as "[[Tanakh]]", an acronym composed from the Hebrew initial letters of its three major sections: [[Torah]] (five books of Moses), [[Nevi'im]] (prophets), and [[K'tuvim]] (writings). Many rabbinical figures from the Middle Ages onward are referred to in rabbinical literature by their pronounced acronyms, such as [[Maimonides|Rambam]] and [[Rashi]] from the initial letters of their full Hebrew names: Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon and Rabbi Shlomo Yitzkhaki.

During the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating [[corporation]] names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of [[railroad car]]s (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&amp;P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on [[ticker tape]] and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&amp;T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include [[Nabisco]] (National Biscuit Company),&lt;ref name=Davenport/&gt; [[Esso]] (from S.O., from [[Standard Oil]]), and [[Sunoco]] (Sun Oil Company).

Another driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the [[American Civil War]] (acronyms such as [[Army of Northern Virginia|ANV]] for "Army of Northern Virginia" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in [[World War I]] and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php|title=Baloney|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves were referred to as [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s.

The widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') records the first printed use of the word ''initialism'' as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after ''acronym'' had become common.

By 1943, the term ''acronym'' had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words.&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;B. Davenport ''American Notes and Queries'' (February 1943) vol 2 page 167 "Your correspondent who asks about words made up of the initial letters or syllables of other words may be interested in knowing that I have seen such words called by the name ''acronym'', which is useful and clear to anyone who knows a little Greek."&lt;/ref&gt; (It was formed from the Greek words {{lang|grc|ἄκρος}}, ''{{transl|grc|akros}}'', "topmost, extreme" and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}}, ''{{transl|grc|onoma}}'', "name.") For example, the army offense of being ''absent without official leave'' was abbreviated to "[[Desertion|A.W.O.L.]]" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (''awol''), it became an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Baum (1962) ''American Speech'' Vol. 37 No. 1, The Acronym, Pure and Impure&lt;/ref&gt; While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was "a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words",&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1943) Vol. 18, No. 2, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[UNIVAC I|UNIVAC]] from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1950) Vol. 25 No. 2 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, acronyms ''pronounced as words'' may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in ''Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends'' claims that "forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is ''colinderies'' or ''colinda'', an acronym for the [[Colonial and Indian Exposition]] held in London in that year."&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cp0r3aa8EM8C&amp;dq=Word+Myths:+Debunking+Linguistic+Urban+Legends&amp;pg=PP1#PPA79,M1 |title=Word myths: debunking linguistic urban legends|publisher=|date= |author=Wilton, David|accessdate=September 16, 2010|isbn=978-0-19-517284-3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/acronyms.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Language (Acronyms) |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although acronymic words seem not to have been ''employed in general vocabulary'' before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the ''concept of their formation'' is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, "[[How to Write a Blackwood Article]]", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.

===Early examples in English===
The use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in [[vernacular]]s has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:

*''[[12-hour clock|A.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|ante meridiem}}'', "before noon") and ''[[12-hour clock|P.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|post meridiem}}'', "after noon")
*''A.D.'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Anno Domini]]}}'', "in the year of our Lord"), whose complement in English, ''B.C.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Before Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is English-sourced
*''[[Okay|O.K.]]'', a term of disputed origin, dating back at least to the early 19th century, now used around the world

The earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|''OED'']] is "abjud" (now "[[abjad]]"), formed from the original first four letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=abjad, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/271930 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[acrostics]] predate this, however, such as the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] witticism arranging the names of some members of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the [[Cabal ministry|"CABAL" ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=cabal, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25693 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use===
Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The [[Military|armed forces]] and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the "[[alphabet agencies]]" (also jokingly referred to as "[[alphabet soup (linguistics)|alphabet soup]]") created by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (also of course known as FDR) under the [[New Deal]]. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for ''commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific''; it's also seen as "ComCruDesPac". "YABA-compatible" (where YABA stands for "yet another bloody acronym") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., "When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'."&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Nilsen &amp; A. P. Nilsen (1995) ''The English Journal'' Vol. 84, No. 6.,"Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language"&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as "GF" (girlfriend), "LOL" (laughing out loud), and "DL" (download or down low) have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8|Txtng: The Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivist]]s disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use "pure" or "proper" English.  Others point out that [[language change]] has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in "proper" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper [[column inch]]es).

====Aids to learning the expansion without leaving a document====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
In formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a [[common noun]] such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a [[proper noun]] such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at [[#Casing of expansions|Case &gt; Casing of expansions]]).

In addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).

Expansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as [[tooltip]]s, [[hyperlink]]s, and rapid search via [[search engine technology]].

====Jargon====
Acronyms often occur in [[jargon]]. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.

The medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.
&lt;ref name="PMID19150279"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Patel CB, Rashid RM |title=Averting the proliferation of acronymophilia in dermatology: effectively avoiding ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=340–4 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19150279 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.10.035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As mnemonics====
Acronyms are often taught as [[mnemonic]] devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are [[ROY G. BIV]] (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: [[GUMPS]], which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include [[CAN SLIM]], and [[PAVPANIC]] as well as [[PEMDAS]].

====Acronyms as legendary etymology====
{{See also|Backronym}}

It is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of [[false etymology]], called a ''folk etymology'', for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in [[historical linguistics]], and are examples of language-related [[urban legend]]s. For example, ''[[police officer|cop]]'' is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from "constable on patrol,"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/cop.asp Snopes article].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Posh (nautical term)|posh]]'' from "[[Port Outward, Starboard Home|port out, starboard home]]".&lt;ref name="posh"&gt;
{{Cite book|title=Port Out, Starboard Home: And Other Language Myths|publisher=Penguin Books|last=Quinion|first=Michael|isbn=0-14-101223-4|year=2005}}; published in the US as
{{Cite book|title=Ballyhoo, Buckaroo, and Spuds|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-085153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some of these specious expansions, the "belief" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been [[tongue-in-cheek]] among many citers, as with "gentlemen only, ladies forbidden" for ''[[golf]]'', although many other (more [[wikt:credulous|credulous]]) people have uncritically taken it for fact.&lt;ref name="posh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/golf.asp |title=See article at Snopes |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taboo word]]s in particular commonly have such false etymologies: ''[[shit]]'' from "ship/store high in transit"&lt;ref name="Wilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "special high-intensity training" and ''[[fuck]]'' from "for unlawful carnal knowledge", or "fornication under consent/command of the king".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"/&gt;

==Orthographic styling==

===Punctuation===

====Showing the ellipsis of letters====
In English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a [[full stop|full stop/period/point]] in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and [[apostrophe]] have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. "A.&amp;nbsp;D."). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''initialism''. " Globe &amp; Mail (Toronto)  22 May 10/4   Americanization has also largely done away with periods in acronyms and initialisms."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ellipsis-is-understood style=====
Some influential [[style guide]]s, such as that of the [[BBC]], no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of ''The [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Guide to Punctuation'', states categorically that, in [[British English]], "this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html |title=Abbreviations |publisher=Informatics.susx.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070410113359/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html| archivedate=April 10, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pronunciation-dependent style and periods=====
Nevertheless, some influential [[style guide]]s, many of them [[American English|American]], still require periods in certain instances. For example, [[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage|The New York Times' guide]] recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in ''[[KGB|K.G.B.]]'', but not when pronounced as a word, as in ''[[NATO]]''.&lt;ref name = "NY Times"&gt;
{{Cite news

|last=Kristoff
|work=The New York Times

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.

=====Other conventions=====
When a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. ''TV'', for example, may stand for a ''single'' word (''television'' or ''transvestite'', for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although ''PS'' stands for the single word ''postscript'' (or the Latin ''postscriptum''), it is often spelled with periods (''P.S.'').

The [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] ('/', or ''solidus'') is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in ''N/A'' (''not applicable, not available''), ''c/o'' (''care of'') and ''w/o'' (''without'').

Inconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, ''i18n'' abbreviates ''[[internationalization]]'', a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The ''18'' represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in ''internationalization''. ''Localization'' can be abbreviated ''l10n'', ''[[multilingualization]]'' ''m17n'', and ''[[accessibility]]'' ''a11y''. In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general "x" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include ''Crxn'' for ''crystallization'' and the series familiar to physicians for [[medical history|history]], [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], and [[therapy|treatment]] (''hx'', ''dx'', ''tx'').

====Representing plurals and possessives====

There is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, [[Kate Turabian]], writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s". The [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so "compact discs" would be "CDs" or "C.D.s"), whereas ''[[The New York Times]]'' style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's").&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, ''the C.D.'s' labels'' (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is ''S'', as in ''SOS's'' (although abbreviations ending with S can also take ''-es'', e.g. ''SOSes''), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |title=Writer's Block&amp;nbsp;– Writing Tips&amp;nbsp;– Plural and Possessive Abbreviations |publisher=Writersblock.ca |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726124408/http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert |url=http://www.editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |title=EditFast Grammar Resource: Apostrophes: Forming Plurals |publisher=Editfast.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027001351/http://editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is ''Member of Parliament'', which in plural is ''Members of Parliament''. It is possible then to abbreviate this as ''M's P.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an41354070 |title=Libraries Australia&amp;nbsp;– T.H.

In common usage, therefore, ''weapons of mass destruction'' becomes ''WMDs'', ''prisoners of war'' becomes ''POWs'', and ''runs batted in'' becomes ''RBIs''.&lt;ref name="Garner2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan |title=Garner's Modern American Usage|date=August 27, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, "If ''D'' can stand for ''disc'', it can also stand for ''disc'''s'''''") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, ''U.S.'' is short for ''United State'''s''''', but not ''United State''. In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final ''s'' may seem awkward: for example, ''U.S.'', ''U.S.'s'', etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple [[adjective|attributive]] usage (for example, ''the '''U.S.''' economy'') or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and ''then'' making the possessive (for example, ''the '''United States'''' economy''). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation ''United States's'' sometimes is used.

Abbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as ''TV'' (''television'')—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (''two TVs''); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (''the TV's antenna'').

{{anchor|pp|PP|pP|Pp|page|pages}} In some languages, the convention of doubling the letters in the acronym is used to indicate plural words: for example, the Spanish ''{{lang|es|EE. UU.}}'', for ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}'' ('United States'). This old convention is still followed for a limited number of English abbreviations, such as ''SS.'' for "Saints", ''pp.'' for the Latin plural of "pages", ''{{lang|la|paginae}}'', or ''MSS'' for "manuscripts". In the case of ''pp.'' it derives from the original Latin phrase per procurationem meaning 'through the agency of';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pp Definition|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pp|website=en.oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English translation alternative is ''particular pages'' in a book or document: see pp. 8–88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|title=Cambridge Dictionary - English Dictionary, Translations &amp; Thesaurus|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|English possessive}}

===Case===

====All-caps style====
The most common [[capitalization]] scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase ([[All caps|all-caps]]), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words ''[[scuba set|scuba]]'', ''[[laser]]'', and ''[[radar]]''—these are known as ''anacronyms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anacronyms (note well ''-acro-'') should not be [[homophone|homophonously]] confused with [[misnomer#Anachronym|anachronyms (note well ''-chron-''), which are a type of misnomer]].

=====Small-caps variant=====
[[Small caps]] are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}; thus "U.S." and "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]]" in normal caps, but "{{smallcaps|nato}}" in small caps. The acronyms "[[Anno Domini|AD]]" and "[[Before Christ|BC]]" are often smallcapped as well, as in: "From {{nowrap|4004 {{smallcaps|bc}} to {{smallcaps|ad}} 525}}".

=====Mixed-case variant=====
Words derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, ''pre-WWII politics'', ''post-NATO world'', ''[[DNAase]]''. In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, [[messenger RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]] become mRNA and tRNA.

====Pronunciation-dependent style and case====
Some publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms "Nato" and "Aids" in mixed case, but the initialisms "USA" and "FBI" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide |title=Styleguide |publisher=Guardian.co.uk | location=London | date=December 19, 2008 |quote=Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as [[AWOL|awol]], [[laser]] and, more recently, [[asbo]], [[pin number]] and [[sim card]]. Note that [[pdf]] and [[public limited company|plc]] are lowercase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC News]] typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsstyleguide.pdf |title=BBC News Style Guide |publisher=bbc.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214856/http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsStyleGuide.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.

Some style manuals also base the letters' [[Letter case|case]] on their number. ''The New York Times'', for example, keeps ''NATO'' in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it ''Nato''), but uses lower case in ''[[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]'' (from "United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of "shouting capitals").

===Numerals and constituent words===
While abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short [[function word]]s (such as "and", "or", "of", or "to"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in [[Letter case#Headings and publication titles|headers and publication titles]].) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE ([[Congress of Racial Equality]]). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL ([[Transport for London]]) and ''LotR'' (''[[Lord of the Rings]]''); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.

Numbers (both [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinal]]) in names are often represented by [[numerical digit|digit]]s rather than initial letters: as in ''4GL'' ([[Fourth generation language]]) or ''G77'' ([[Group of 77]]). Large numbers may use [[SI prefix#Use outside SI|metric prefixes]], as with ''[[Y2K]]'' for "Year 2000" (sometimes written ''Y2k'', because the SI symbol for 1000 is ''k''—not ''K'', which stands for ''[[kelvin]]''). Exceptions using initials for numbers include ''[[three letter acronym|TLA]]'' (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and ''GoF'' ([[Gang of Four (software)|Gang of Four]]). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as ''[[W3C]]'' ("World Wide Web Consortium") and ''[[WVOX#Notable Past Programming|T3]]'' (''Trends, Tips &amp; Tools for Everyday Living''); pronunciation, such as ''[[Business-to-business|B2B]]'' ("business to business"); and [[numeronym]]s, such as ''i18n'' ("internationalization"; ''18'' represents the 18 letters between the initial ''i'' and the final ''n'').

===Casing of expansions===
Although many authors of [[expository writing]] show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of [[English orthography]], which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for [[proper noun]]s. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the only citation is to the AMA Manual of Style; what do other style guides say? --&gt; [[Case folding|case-fold]] such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography.  Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example,
"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)" or "the onset of '''c'''ongestive '''h'''eart '''f'''ailure (CHF)" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as "the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)" in the final published article when following the [[AMA Manual of Style]].&lt;ref name="AMA10p442"&gt;{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al.

==Changes to (or word play on) the expanded meaning==
===Pseudo-acronyms=== &lt;!-- [[Pseudo-acronym]] and [[Orphan initialism]] are redirects to this section --&gt;
Some apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such '''pseudo-acronyms''' may be pronunciation-based, such as [[BBQ]] (bee-bee-cue), for "barbecue", or [[K9 (disambiguation)|K9]] (kay-nine) for "canine". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as "'''orphan initialisms'''"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html|title=Language Log: Orphan initialisms|website=itre.cis.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm What Does "BP" Stand For?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118220424/http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm |date=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters of the [[SAT]], a US college entrance test originally dubbed "Scholastic Aptitude Test", no longer officially stand for anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/us/insisting-it-s-nothing-creator-says-sat-not-sat.html  |title=Insisting It's Nothing, Creator Says SAT, Not S.A.T. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1997 |last=Applebome |first=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Changes to SAT Make Test More Coachable |last=Komarek |first=Dan |newspaper=Daily Californian| date=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is common with companies that want to retain [[brand recognition]] while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]],&lt;ref name=upenn /&gt; [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] became [[KFC]] to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n8_v25/ai_10403447 |title=KFC shuns 'fried' image with new name&amp;nbsp;– Kentucky Fried Chicken has changed its name to KFC |author=Peter O. Keegan |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=February 21, 1991 |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This change was also applied to other languages, with ''Poulet Frit Kentucky'' becoming ''PFK'' in French Canada.}} and [[BP|British Petroleum]] became BP.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=287|title=BP plc History|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia Today]] has rebranded itself as [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Pseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets:{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} for example, some national [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]]s of [[International Business Machines]] are legally incorporated as "IBM" (for example, "IBM Canada") to avoid translating the full name into local languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Likewise, "[[UBS AG|UBS]]" is the name of the merged [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] and [[Swiss Bank Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2833426/UBS-means-RIP-for-Warburg.html UBS means RIP for Warburg]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', November 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and  "[[HSBC]]" has replaced "The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation." Sometimes,{{when|date=October 2017}} companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as [[TD Canada Trust|TD Bank]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} just as [[Royal Bank of Canada]] used its full name in Canada (a [[constitutional monarchy]]), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called [[RBC Bank]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Redundant acronyms and RAS syndrome===
{{Main|RAS syndrome}}
Rebranding can lead to [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym syndrome]],{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} as when [[Trustee Savings Bank]] became TSB Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Railway Express Agency]] became REA Express.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} A few{{vague|date=October 2017}} [[high-tech]] companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Examples in entertainment include the television shows ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|Navy: NCIS]]''{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ("Navy" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely{{weasel inline|date=October 2017}} designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The same reasoning{{according to whom|date=November 2017}} was in evidence when the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Bank of Montreal]] rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Another common example{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} is "[[Random-access memory|RAM]] memory", which is redundant because "RAM" ("random-access memory") includes the initial of the word "memory".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} "PIN" stands for "personal identification number", obviating the second word in "[[PIN number]]"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word "pin".{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} Other examples include "[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] machine," "[[EAB bank]]," "[[Cable Ace|CableACE Award]]," "[[DC Comics]]," "[[HIV]] virus," Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant "[[SAT]] test," now simply "SAT Reasoning Test").{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[Spike (TV network)|TNN]] (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself "The New TNN" for a brief interlude.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Simple redefining===
Sometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:
*[[DVD]] was originally an acronym of the unofficial term ''digital video disc'', but is now stated by the [[DVD Forum]] as standing for ''Digital Versatile Disc''.
*[[GAO]] changed the full form of its name from ''General Accounting Office'' to ''Government Accountability Office''.
*[[United States Government Publishing Office|GPO]] (in the United States) changed the full form of its name from ''Government Printing Office'' to ''Government Publishing Office''.
*[[RAID]] used to mean ''Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks'', but is now commonly interpreted as ''Redundant Array of Independent Disks''.
*WWF originally stood for ''World Wildlife Fund'', but now stands for ''[[Worldwide Fund for Nature]]'' (although the former name is still used in Canada and the United States).
*The [[Union for International Cancer Control|UICC]], whose initials came from the [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] versions of its name (such as French ''{{lang|fr|Union Internationale Contre le Cancer}}'', "International Union Against Cancer"), changed the English expansion of its name to Union for International Cancer Control (from International Union Against Cancer) so that the English expansion, too, would correspond to the UICC initials.

===Backronyms===
{{Main|Backronym}}

A ''backronym'' (or ''bacronym'') is a [[phrase]] that is constructed "after the fact" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic [[Anthony Burgess]] once proposed that the word "book" ought to stand for "'''B'''ox '''O'''f '''O'''rganized '''K'''nowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939'' (New York: Summit Books, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The [[Apple Lisa]], which was said to refer to "Local Integrated Software Architecture", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.

Backronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) "A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men".

===Contrived acronyms===
Acronyms are sometimes [[wikt:contrive#Verb|contrived]], that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are ''[[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT]]'', [[Can Spam Act|''CAN SPAM'']], ''[[CAPTCHA]]'' and ''[[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The clothing company [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] began referring to itself as ''fcuk'', standing for "French Connection United Kingdom." The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word "[[fuck]]."

The US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including ''RESURRECT'', ''NIRVANA'', and ''DUDE''. In July 2010, [[Wired Magazine]] reported that DARPA announced programs to "..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science" named ''BATMAN'' and ''ROBIN'' for ''Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature'' and ''Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/holy-acronym-darpa-batman-robin-to-master-biology-outdo-evolution/| title= Holy Acronym, Darpa! 'Batman &amp; Robin' to Master Biology, Outdo Evolution | author= Katie Drummond | work=Wired| date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] comic-book superheroes.

The short-form names of [[clinical trial]]s and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as [[name]]s within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of [[mnemonic]] reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in [[medicine]] include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that [[RAS syndrome]] is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the [[archetype|archetypal]] form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of clinical trial acronyms, as with [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|gene and protein symbols]], is simply to have a syntactically usable and [[recall (memory)|recallable]] short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not [[memorization|memorized]]. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of "cutesy" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a [[name]], rather than being a [[wikt:cryptic#Adjective|cryptic]] and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document,&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cheng |first=Tsung O |year=2003 |title=No more unexplained trial acronyms please. Trial Acronyms: Better Obvious than Obscure (TABOO) |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=89 |issue=2-3 |pages=303 |pmid=12767559 |doi=10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00411-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication.&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"/&gt; At least one study has evaluated the [[citation impact]] and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others,&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanbrook |first=MB |last2=Austin |first2=PC |last3=Redelmeier |first3=DA |year=2006 |title=Acronym-named randomized trials in medicine—the ART in medicine study |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=355 |issue=1 |pages=101–102 |pmid=16823008 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc053420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws ([[connotation|connotatively]] driven [[bias]]).&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"/&gt;

Some acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, ''[[Verliebt in Berlin]]'' (ViB), a German [[telenovela]], was first intended to be ''Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)'', but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym ''[[anal sex|ANAL]]''. Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as ''CLaIT'',&lt;ref name="CIE.org.uk_CLaIT"&gt;{{Citation|author=University of Cambridge International Examinations team |title=University of Cambridge International Examinations &gt; CLAiT–International page |url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114062047/http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''[[clitoris|CLIT]]''. In Canada, the [[Canadian Alliance|Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party)]] was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced "see [[feces|crap]]"). (The satirical magazine ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]].) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology ([[breast|TIT]]). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology ([[wikt:git|GIT]]). The charity sports organization [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society#Fundraising|Team in Training]] is known as "TNT" and not "TIT". [[Technological Institute of Textile &amp; Sciences]] is still known as TITS. [[George Mason University]] was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law ([[asshole|ASSOL]]) in honor of the late [[Antonin Scalia]], only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473339332/unfortunate-acronym-forces-law-school-name-change| title= Unfortunate Acronym Forces Law School Name Change | author= Morning Edition | work=NPR| date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macronyms/nested acronyms===
A '''macronym''', or '''nested acronym''', is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word "macronym" is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[wikt:macro-|macro-]]" and "acronym".

Some examples of macronyms are: &lt;!-- with citations in each individual article's references --&gt;
* [[XHR]] stands for "XML HTTP Request", in which [[XML]] is "eXtensible Markup Language", and [[HTTP]] stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol".
* [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] stands for ''Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC'', in which [[RISC]] stands for ''Reduced Instruction Set Computing''.
* [[VHDL]] stands for "VHSIC Hardware Description Language", in which [[VHSIC]] stands for "Very High Speed Integrated Circuit".
* [[XSD]] stands for "XML Schema Definition", in which [[XML]] stands for "eXtensible Markup Language".
* [[SECS]] stands for "SEMI equipment communication standard", in which [[SEMI]] stands for "Semiconductor equipment manufacturing industries".
* [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] stands for "AOL Instant Messenger", in which [[AOL]] stands for "[[America Online]]".
* [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] stood for Houston Automatic Spooling Priority, but [[spooling]] itself was an acronym&amp;nbsp;– simultaneous peripheral operations on-line

Some macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'', a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the "Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service"; ATOVS is "Advanced TOVS"; TOVS is "[[TIROS]] operational vertical sounder"; and TIROS is "Television infrared observational satellite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html |title=Very deep multiply nested acronyms |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914033751/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html| archivedate= September 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully expanded, "RARS" might thus become "Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service". However, to say that "RARS" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in [[syntax]] (in the same way that "CHF" can be usefully interchanged with "congestive heart failure"), is a [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to [[#All-caps style|anacronymic]] than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to "spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations," but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be [[gloss (annotation)|annotated]] with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words ''laser'' and ''radar'' function as words in [[syntax]] and [[cognition]] without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as "RARS" and "[[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]" are irreducible in [[natural language]]; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, [[protein]] and [[gene]] nomenclature, [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|which uses symbols extensively]], includes such terms as the name of the [[NACHT domain|NACHT protein domain]], which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from ''Podospora anserine''), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a [[name]] within a [[clause]] clearly [[parsing|parsable]] by human readers or listeners.

====Recursive acronyms====
{{Main|Recursive acronym}}
A special type of macronym, the [[recursive acronym]], has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in ''[[The Hacker's Dictionary]]'' as [[Mung (computer term)|MUNG]], which stands for "MUNG Until No Good".

Some examples of recursive acronyms are:
* [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's Not Unix"
* [[LAME]] stands for "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder"
* [[PHP]] stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
* [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator"
* [[GNU Hurd|HURD]] stands for "HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons", where HIRD itself stands for "HURD of interfaces representing depth" (a "mutually recursive" acronym)

==Non-English languages==

===Specific languages===

====Chinese====
In English language discussions of languages with [[syllabary|syllabic]] or [[logographic]] writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), "acronyms" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.

For example, in Chinese, "university" ({{lang|zh-hant|大學}}/{{lang|zh-hans|大学}}, literally "great learning") is usually abbreviated simply as {{lang|zh|大}} ("great") when used with the name of the institute. So ''[[Peking University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hans|北京大学}}) is commonly shortened to {{lang|zh|北大}} ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "north-great") by also only taking the first character of ''Peking'', the "northern capital" ({{zh | c=北京| p=Beijing | labels=no}}). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of ''[[Hong Kong University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|香港大學}}) uses ''Kong'' ({{lang|zh-hant|港大}}) rather than ''Hong''.

There are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC), is "Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the "Communist Party of China" part of its name through acronyms, then the "Standing Committee" part, again through acronyms, to create "中共中央政治局常委". Alternatively, it omitted the "Communist Party" part altogether, creating "Politburo Standing Committee" (政治局常委会), and eventually just "Standing Committee" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are "Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply ''Changwei'' (常委), with the term ''Ruchang'' (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word "全国人民代表大会" ([[National People's Congress]]) can be broken into four parts: "全国" = "the whole nation", "人民" = "people", "代表" = "representatives", "大会" = "conference". Yet, in its short form "人大" (literally "man/people big"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part ("全国") and the third part ("代表") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term ''initialism'' is inapplicable.{{Original research inline|date=November 2012}}

Many proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], whose full name is literally read as "China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to "Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply ''Chunwan'' (春晚). Along the same vein, ''Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai'' (中国中央电视台) was reduced to ''Yangshi'' (央视) in the mid-2000s.

====Korean====
Many aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for "big" or "great" i.e. ''dae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대}}), to refer to universities ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학}}; ''daehak,'' literally "great learning" although "big school" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as "UPenn" or "Texas Tech."

Some acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how [[Hongik University]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍익대학교}}, ''Hongik Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Hongdae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍대}}, "Hong, the big [school]" or "Hong-U") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. [[Korea National University of Education]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국교원대학교}}, ''Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Gyowondae'' (교원대, "Big Ed." or "Ed.-U"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국과학기술원}}, ''Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon'') is referred to as KAIST ({{lang|ko-Hang|카이스트}}, ''Kaiseuteu'') in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, ''seukai''), combining the first letter of their English names ('''S'''eoul National, '''K'''orea, and '''Y'''onsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학수학능력시험}}, ''Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom'') is shortened to ''Suneung'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|수능}}, "S.A.").

====Japanese====
{{main|Japanese abbreviated and contracted words}}
The [[Japanese language]] makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.

Chinese-based words ([[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like {{nihongo|''Tōdai''|東大}} for {{nihongo|''Tōkyō Daigaku''|東京大学|Tokyo University}}. In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in [[Saikyō Line|Saikyō]] for 埼京, from {{nihongo|''[[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]]'' + ''[[Tōkyo]]''|埼玉＋東京}}, rather than Sai'''tō'''.

Non-Chinese foreign borrowings ([[gairaigo]]) are instead frequently abbreviated as [[clipped compound]]s, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in [[katakana]] transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in [[hiragana]]). For example, the ''[[Pokémon]]'' media franchise's name originally stood for "pocket monsters" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ポケ'''ット·'''モン'''スター}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ポケモン}}), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and "[[wāpuro]]" stands for "[[word processor]]" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ワー'''ド·'''プロ'''セッサー}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ワープロ}}).

====German====
To a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are ''[[Gestapo]]'' rather than ''GSP'' (for ''{{lang|de|Geheime Staatspolizei}}'', 'secret state police'); ''{{lang|de|Flak}}'' rather than ''FAK'' (for ''{{lang|de|Fliegerabwehrkanone}}'', [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun); ''{{lang|de|Kripo}}'' rather than ''KP'' (for ''{{lang|de|[[Kriminalpolizei]]}}'', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:de:Aküfi|Aküfi]]}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|Abkürzungsfimmel}}'', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of {{lang|de|Aküfi}} include ''{{lang|de|Vokuhila}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|vorne kurz, hinten lang}}'', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]) and the mocking of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s title as ''{{lang|de|[[Gröfaz]]}}'' (''{{lang|de|Größter Feldherr aller Zeiten}}'', Greatest General of all Times).

====Hebrew====
{{Main|Hebrew acronyms}}

It is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] {{angle bracket|״}} is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word.  Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): {{lang|he|ארה״ב|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ארצות הברית|rtl=yes}}, the United States); {{lang|he|ברה״מ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ברית המועצות|rtl=yes}}, the Soviet Union); {{lang|he|ראשל״צ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ראשון לציון|rtl=yes}}, [[Rishon LeZion]]); {{lang|he|ביה״ס|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|בית הספר|rtl=yes}}, the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is {{lang|he|צה״ל|rtl=yes}} (''Tzahal'', for {{lang|he|צבא הגנה לישראל|rtl=yes}}, [[Israel Defense Forces]]). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. "report", singular: {{lang|he|דו״ח|rtl=yes}}, plural: {{lang|he|דו״חות|rtl=yes}}; "squad commander", masculine: {{lang|he|מ״כ|rtl=yes}}, feminine: {{lang|he|מ״כית|rtl=yes}}).

====Indonesian====
{{see also|List of Indonesian acronyms and abbreviations}}
There is also a widespread use of acronyms in [[Indonesia]] in every aspect of social life. For example, the ''[[Golkar]]'' political party stands for Partai ''Gol''ongan ''Kar''ya, ''[[Monas]]'' stands for "''Mo''numen ''Nas''ional" (National Monument), the ''Angkot'' public transport stands for "''Ang''kutan ''Kot''a" ([[Share taxi#indonesia|city public transportation]]), ''warnet'' stands for "''war''ung inter''net''" ([[internet cafe]]), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, [[slang]] or [[colloquial]].

The capital's metropolitan area ([[Jakarta]] and its surrounding [[satellite city|satellite regions]]), ''[[Jabodetabek]]'', is another infamous acronym. This stands for ''Ja''karta-''Bo''gor-''De''pok-''Ta''ngerang-''Bek''asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. ''Jalan Tol'' (Toll Road) ''Jagorawi'' (''Ja''karta-Bo''gor''-Ci''awi'') and ''Purbaleunyi'' (''Pur''wakarta-''Ba''ndung-Ci''leunyi''), Joglo Semar (''Jog''ja-so''lo''-''semar''ang).

In some languages, especially those that use certain [[alphabets]], many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The [[Indonesian military]] (TNI—''Tentara Nasional Indonesia'') and [[Indonesian police]] (POLRI—''Kepolisian Republik Indonesia'') are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the ''[[Kopassus]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan Khu''sus''; [[Special Forces]] Command), ''[[Kopaska]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan ''Ka''tak; [[Frogmen]] Command), ''Kodim'' (''Ko''mando ''Di''strik ''M''iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's [[administrative divisions]]), ''Serka'' (''Ser''san ''K''ep''a''la; Head [[Sergeant]]), ''Akmil'' (''Ak''ademi ''Mil''iter; Military Academy—in [[Magelang]]) and many other terms regarding [[military ranks|ranks]], units, divisions, procedures, etc.

Heavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] to seek information and news in Indonesian [[media (communication)|media]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Russian====
Acronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. {{lang|ru|Газпром}} ([[Gazprom]]), for {{lang|ru|Газовая промышленность}} (''{{transl|ru|Gazovaya promyshlennost}}'', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (''SMI'', for {{lang|ru|средства массовой информации}} ''{{transl|ru|sredstva massovoy informatsii}}'', means of mass informing, i.e. [[mass media]]). Another Russian acronym, {{lang|ru|ГУЛаг}} ([[GULag]]) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for {{lang|ru|Главное управление лагерей}} (''{{transl|ru|Glavnoe upravlenie lagerey}}'', Chief Administration of Camps).

Historically, [[OTMA]] was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of [[Emperor]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and his consort, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.

====Swahili====
In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for ''{{lang|sw|Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili}}'' (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.

====Vietnamese====
In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include ''[[wikt:TP.HCM|TP.HCM]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}'', [[Ho Chi Minh City]]), ''[[wikt:THPT|THPT]]'' (''{{lang|vi|trung học phổ thông}}'', high school), ''[[wikt:CLB|CLB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|câu lạc bộ}}'', club), ''[[wikt:CSDL|CSDL]]'' (''{{lang|vi|cơ sở dữ liệu}}'', database), ''[[wikt:NXB|NXB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|nhà xuất bản}}'', publisher), ''[[wikt:ÔBACE|ÔBACE]]'' (''{{lang|vi|ông bà anh chị em}}'', a general form of address), and ''[[wikt:CTTĐVN|CTTĐVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|các Thánh tử đạo Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnamese Martyrs]]). Longer examples include ''[[wikt:CHXHCNVN|CHXHCNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]) and ''[[wikt:MTDTGPMNVN|MTDTGPMNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam}}'', [[Viet Cong]]). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Từ viết tắt|trans-title=Abbreviations|publisher=[[BBC Academy]]|accessdate=September 4, 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/vietnamese/article/art20131007102738486|language=vi|quote=Chưa kể cách viết này còn dễ bị cho là lười biếng hoặc tỏ ra quan trọng, vì đây là cách chép nguyên xi, máy móc các cụm từ viết tắt từ văn bản pháp quy của chính quyền, như TTLT-VKSNDTC-TANDTC, khá phổ biến ở Việt Nam hiện nay.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.

Each letter in an initialism corresponds to one [[morpheme]]—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example ''ĐNA'' or ''ĐNÁ'' for ''{{lang|vi|Đông Nam Á}}'' ([[Southeast Asia]]) and ''LMCA'' or ''LMCÂ'' for ''Liên minh châu Âu'' ([[European Union]]). The letter "[[Ư]]" is often replaced by "W" in initialisms to avoid confusion with "U", for example ''UBTWMTTQVN'' or ''UBTƯMTTQVN'' for ''Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam'' (Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]]).

Initialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the [[Vietnamese alphabet#Letter names and pronunciation|names of many Vietnamese letters]] are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ''{{linktext|SIĐA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|s̪i˧˧ ˀɗaː˧˧|pron}}), a respelling of the French acronym ''SIDA'' ([[AIDS]]); ''{{linktext|VOA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|vwaː˧˧|pron}}), a literal reading of the English initialism for [[Voice of America]]; and ''[[NASA]]'' ({{IPA-vi|naː˧˧ zaː˧˧|pron}}), borrowed directly from the English acronym.

As in [[#Chinese|Chinese]], many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] is derived from the first syllables of "Việt Nam" (Vietnam) and "Cộng sản" (communist). This mechanism is limited to [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]]. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered [[portmanteau]] words or [[blend word]]s rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.

===General grammatical considerations===

====Declension====
In languages where nouns are [[declension|declined]], various methods are used. An example is [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:
*An acronym is pronounced as a word: Nato {{IPA-fi|nato|}}—''{{lang|fi|Natoon}}'' {{IPA|[natoːn]}} "into Nato", Nasalta "from [[NASA]]"
*An acronym is pronounced as letters: EU {{IPA|[eː uː]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:hun}}'' {{IPA|[eː uːhun]}} "into EU"
*An acronym is interpreted as words: EU {{IPA|[euroːpan unioni]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:iin}}'' {{IPA|[euroːpan unioniːn]}} "into EU"
The process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus ''pre-NATO policy'' (rather than ''preNATO'').

====Lenition====
In languages such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], where [[lenition]] (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case "h" is added after the initial consonant; for example, ''[[BBC Scotland]]'' in the genitive case would be written as ''BhBC Alba'', with the acronym pronounced "VBC". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for "television" (''gd: telebhisean'') is ''TBh'', pronounced "TV", as in English.

==Extremes==
*The longest acronym, according to the 1965 edition of ''Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary'', is ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC, a [[United States Navy]] term that stands for "Administrative Command, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet Subordinate Command."  Another term COMNAVSEACOMBATSYSENGSTA, which stands for "Commander, Naval Sea Systems Combat Engineering Station" is longer but the word "Combat" is not shortened.
*The world's longest acronym, according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', is НИИОМТПЛАБОПАРМБЕТЖЕЛБЕТРАБСБОМОНИМОНКОНОТДТЕХСТРОМОНТ {{transl|ru|(NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT)}}. However, this is more precisely a combination acronym/[[clipped compound]], as multiple initial letters of some constituent words are used. The 56-letter term (54 in [[Cyrillic]]) is from the ''Concise Dictionary of Soviet Terminology'' and means "The laboratory for shuttering, reinforcement, concrete and ferroconcrete operations for composite-monolithic and monolithic constructions of the Department of the Technology of Building-assembly operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for building mechanization and technical aid of the Academy of Building and Architecture of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]." ({{lang|ru|'''н'''аучно-'''и'''сследовательская '''[...]''' '''лаб'''оратория '''оп'''ераций по '''арм'''ированию '''бет'''она и '''жел'''езо'''бет'''онных '''раб'''от по сооружению '''сбо'''рно-'''мон'''олитных '''и''' '''мон'''олитных '''кон'''струкций '''отд'''ела '''тех'''нологии '''стро'''ительно-'''монт'''ажного управления}})
*The card-game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has a playing card called "Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental", with text on it saying: "Just call it OMRSTPLRLCNSWMTCTHTALCNEE for short."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74237|title=Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental (Unhinged) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|website=gatherer.wizards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbis.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=ubos&amp;colors=&amp;ocolors=&amp;lett=fs&amp;tid=0&amp;titel_id=2223|title=Acronym Finder|date=|website=dbis.uni-regensburg.de|publisher=[[Universität Regensburg]]|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/blog/2017/04/03/e-tipp-der-woche-acronym-finder/|title=e-Tipp der Woche: Acronym Finder {{!}} [UB]log|website=blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/57676-acronym-finder|title=Acronym Finder - ExtremeTech|date=2001-09-05|work=ExtremeTech|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;GIRALDO ORTIZ, John Jairo.

Jul.-Dec. 2008, vol. 31, no. 2, p. 101-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an by [[editing|editor]] and categorized before being added to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Farlex, Inc. the current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acronym-finder-acronyms-abbreviations-initialisms-more/id1032748692?mt=8|title=Acronym Finder - Acronyms, Abbreviations, Initialisms, and more on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym Finder also includes a ''Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector'', a light-hearted tool that [[random]]ly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually [[initialisms]] that would be unpronounceable as [[acronyms]] — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556 &lt;nowiki&gt;Acronym finder [digital] : AF&lt;/nowiki&gt;]".

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Patents Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrdCAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|title=CTM upheld after medical trade mark declared not to be descriptive|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2011|website=oami.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134443/http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|archive-date=November 23, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site's original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[Image:Immanuel Bekker - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|August Immanuel Bekker]]

'''Bekker numbering''' or '''Bekker pagination''' is the standard form of citation to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum|works of Aristotle]].  It is based on the page numbers used in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] edition of the complete works of [[Aristotle]] and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical [[philology|philologist]] [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name '''Berlin numbering''' or '''Berlin pagination'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', ex recognitione Immanuelis Bekkeri, 5 voll. Berlin,  Georgium Reimerum, 1831-1870 (the last volume contains the ''Index Aristotelicus'' by [[Hermann Bonitz]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition).  For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] is ''1094a1'', which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge 1995 xxi&lt;/ref&gt;.

All modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers.  Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.

While Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Thomist]] scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to the works of [[Plato]], and [[Diels-Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'' regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.

== Aristotle's works by Bekker numbers ==

The following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.

===''Constitution of the Athenians''===
The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (or ''Athenaiōn Politeia'') was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the [[British Museum]].  The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.

===Fragments&lt;!--linked from 'Valentin Rose (classicist)'--&gt;===
Surviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]].  These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of [[Aristotle]] was ''Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus'' (1863).  As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the [[Teubner]] series, ''[https://archive.org/details/aristotelisquif00arisgoog Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta]'', Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by ''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in [[Walter de Gruyter]]'s reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by [[Eckart Schütrumpf]] is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle CU-Boulder Expert Wins $75,000 Award For Research On Aristotle,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233125/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle |date=2016-04-18 }} University of Colorado Office of News Services, December 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, ''Select Fragments'' ([https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft Oxford 1952]), and [[Jonathan Barnes]] (ed.), ''The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation'', vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;2384–2465.

The works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues ''On Philosophy'' (or ''On the Good''), ''Eudemus'' (or ''On the Soul''), ''On Justice'', and ''On Good Birth''.  The possibly spurious work, ''[[On Ideas]]'' survives in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.  For the dialogues, see also the editions of [[Richard Rudolf Walzer]], ''Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum'' (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, ''Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi'' (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28836">[[File:John 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Gospel according to John]] - a text showing chapter and verse divisions ([[King James Version]])]]

The [[Bible]] is a compilation of many [[books of the Bible|shorter books]] written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the [[biblical canon]]. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into [[chapter (books)| chapters]], generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:8–9|9}}, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:2|9}}.

As the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the [[paratext]] of the Bible.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many [[Psalms]] are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have  {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:27–41|HE}} where Christian translations have {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1–15|NIV}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|left|"...they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." ~ [[Isaiah 2:4]] KJV (Bible verse across the street from the [[United Nations Building]] in [[New York City]])]]

===Chapters===
Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs ([[parashot]]) that were identified by two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Pe (letter)|Peh פ]] indicated an "open" paragraph that began on a new line, while [[Samekh|Samekh ס]] indicated a "closed" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters begin the Hebrew words open ('''''p'''atuach'') and closed ('''''s'''agoor''), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2&gt;Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as [[acrostic]]s, such as several of the [[Psalms]] and most of the [[Book of Lamentations]].)

The [[Hebrew Bible]] was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the [[Torah]] (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections ([[Parashat ha-Shavua]]) so it could be read through in one year.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2/&gt;  The [[New Testament]] was divided into topical sections known as ''kephalaia'' by the fourth century. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or ''canons''. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1989), pp. 252 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanaregia.eu/en/manuscripts/paris-bibliotheque-nationale-france-mss-latin-3/en|title=Europeana Regia - Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France MSS Latin 3|first=Europeana Regia|last=Consortium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Stephen Langton#Chapters of the Bible|Stephen Langton]] and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347.

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul'' (1707),&lt;ref&gt;London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1707&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell's]] ''The Sacred Writings'' (1826),&lt;ref&gt;1826; repr.

===Verses===
Since at least 916 the [[Tanakh]] has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in [[Masoretic]] vocalization and [[cantillation|cantillation markings]].&lt;!-- page 75 --&gt; One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the ''[[sof passuq]]'', symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the [[Bible]] into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]]'s work for the first Hebrew [[Bible concordance]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], pages 73–78 at [[JSTOR]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3 page 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar [[Santi Pagnini]] (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: A History|author1=Miller, Stephen M. |author2=Huber, Robert V. |year=2004|publisher=Good Books|isbn=1-56148-414-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tools.pitts.emory.edu/Printer/|title = Pitts Theology Library Exhibit on the Verses of the New Testament|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Estienne]] created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/chaptersverses/ "Chapters and Verses: Who Needs Them?,"] Christopher R. Smith, Bible Study Magazine (July–Aug 2009): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by [[William Whittingham]] (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the [[Geneva Bible]] published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is [[The Message (Bible)|''The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language'']] by [[Eugene H. Peterson]].)&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Springs: NavPress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
{{Main article|Tanakh#Chapters and verse numbers, book divisions}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic text]] of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===Verse endings===
{{Main article|Sof passuk}}
Most important are the verse endings. According to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Nedarim'' 37b&lt;/ref&gt; In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a ''silluq'' (which means "stop"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a ''silluq''.

===Parashiyot===
{{main article|Parashah}}
The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'', which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a "closed" section) or a new line beginning (an "open" section). The division of the text reflected in the ''parashot'' is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the ''parashot'' are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] Masoretic manuscripts, such as the [[Aleppo codex]]), an "open" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a "closed" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed [[Hebrew Bible]]s. In this system, the one rule differentiating "open" and "closed" sections is that "open" sections must ''always'' start at the beginning of a new line, while "closed" sections ''never'' start at the beginning of a new line.

===Sedarim===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the ''[[Seder (Bible)|sedarim]]''. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the ''quantity'' of text. For the [[Torah]], this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called ''kephalaia'' (singular ''kephalaion'', literally meaning ''heading'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2016/04/kephalaia-ancient-chapters-of-gospels.html |title=Kephalaia: The Ancient Chapters of the Gospels |last=Snapp | first=James |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one ''kephalaion'' mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one ''kephalaion'' mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer ''kephalaia'' in the [[Gospel of John]] than in the [[Gospel of Mark]], even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the ''kephalaia'' with their numbers, their standard titles (''titloi'') and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.

The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some ''kephalaia'' are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next ''kephalaion'' begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the [[Daughter of Jairus]] and of the [[Christ healing the bleeding woman|healing of the woman with a haemorrhage]]  gets two marked ''kephalaia'', one titled ''of the daughter of the synagogue ruler'' at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled ''of the woman with the flow of blood'' where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous ''kephalaion'' is thus properly concluded). Thus the ''kephalaia'' marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.

Cardinal [[Hugh of St Cher|Hugo de Sancto Caro]] is often given credit for first dividing the [[Latin Vulgate]] into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal [[Stephen Langton]] who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. [[Robert Estienne]] (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name = "Examiner"&gt;[http://www.theexaminer.org/history/chap6.htm The Examiner].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. [[Biblica]] published such a version of the [[NIV]] in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, [[Crossway Books|Crossway]] published the [[ESV]] Reader's Bible and ''[[Bibliotheca (Bible)|Bibliotheca]]'' published a modified ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhof |title=Introducing the Bible! Now with Less! |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/july-web-only/bibliotheca-readers-bible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as Icthus&lt;ref name="Icthus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icthusapp.com|title=Icthus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.

=={{anchor|Statistics}}Protestant Bible statistics==
The number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.
Except where stated, the following apply to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the [[protocanonical]] Old Testament, not the [[deuterocanonical books]].

* There are 929 chapters in the [[Old Testament]].
** 187 chapters in the Pentateuch
** 249 chapters in the Historical books
** 243 chapters in the Poetic books ("Wisdom")
** 183 chapters in the Major prophets
** 67 chapters in the Minor prophets
* There are 260 chapters in the [[New Testament]]. 
** 89 chapters in the Gospels
** 28 chapters in Acts
** 87 chapters in the Pauline Epistles (excluding Hebrews)
** 34 chapters in the General Epistles (including Hebrews)
** 22 chapters in Revelation
* This gives a total of 1,189 chapters (on average, 18 per book).
* Psalm 117, the shortest chapter, is also the middle chapter of the Bible, being the 595th Chapter.&lt;ref name=midbible&gt;[http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html The Center of the Bible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828035123/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html |date=August 28, 2005 }} at BreakTheChain.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Psalm|119|ESV}} is the longest chapter of the Bible.
* Five books are a single chapter: Obadiah, Philemon, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude. In many printed editions, the chapter number is omitted for these books, and references just use the verse numbers.

===Verses===
* There are 23,145 verses in the Old Testament and 7,957 verses in the New Testament. This gives a total of 31,102 verses,&lt;ref name="blueletterbiblebooks"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/study/misc/66books.cfm Study Resources: The Books of the Bible] at BlueLetterBible.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average of a little more than 26 verses per chapter.
* Contrary to popular belief, Psalm 118 does not contain the middle verse of the Bible. The King James Version has an even number of verses (31,102), with the two middle verses being {{bibleverse||Psalm|103:1–2|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/believers-org/kjv-stats.html King James Bible Statistics] at BibleBelievers.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|John|11:35|NASB}} ("[[Jesus wept]]") is the shortest verse in most English translations. Some translations — including the New International Version, New Living Translation, New Life Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible and New International Reader's Version — render {{bibleverse||Job|3:2|HE}} as "He said". However, that is a translators' condensation of the Hebrew which literally translated is: "And Job answered and said."
&lt;!-- non English stats --&gt;
* The shortest verse in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|20:30|NASB}} ("και ο δευτερος", "And the second") with twelve letters, according to the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text. In the [[Textus Receptus]], the shortest verse is {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:16|NASB}} ("παντοτε χαιρετε", "Rejoice always") with fourteen letters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=5585 First Thessalonians 5:12–28], [[John Walvoord]] at Bible.org&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]]' rendering of Luke 20:30 includes some additional words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/LXX_WH-IGNT-KJV/Luke%2020:30 Luke 20:30 και ο δευτερος – and the second] with interlinear Greek-English and KJV&lt;br&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2020:30&amp;version=TR1550;WHNU Luke 20:30], in the 1550 [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]] New Testament and the 1881 [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]] New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|Isaiah|10:8|ESV}} ("''Dicet enim''") is the shortest verse in the Latin [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=27&amp;c=10 Isaias 10] at LatinVulgate.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Esther|8:9|ESV}} is the longest verse in the Masoretic Text. The discovery of several manuscripts at [[Qumran]] (in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) has reopened what is considered the most original text of 1 Samuel 11; if one believes that those manuscripts better preserve the text, several verses in 1 Samuel 11 surpass Esther 8:9 in length.

[[File:Webcomic xkcd - Wikipedian protester.png|thumb|right|250px|[[xkcd]] webcomic titled "Wikipedian Protester"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://xkcd.com/285/ |title= Wikipedian Protestor|author= Randall Munroe |accessdate= 20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==
{{styles}}
{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science.

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J. Scott Armstrong |work=Interfaces |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |date=2008 |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |location=Catonsville, Maryland |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/45579289_Verification_of_Citations_Fawlty_Towers_of_Knowledge/links/00b7d52b08d80022a0000000.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=no |format=PDF |doi=10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |issn=0092-2102 |eissn=1526-551X |jstor=25062982 |oclc=5582131729 |ssrn=1941335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citation Network''' is a [[social network]] which contains paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe &amp; Rousseau once (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;228) explain "when a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' cites a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the document representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/citation_network.htm Science Citation Index: Effectiveness in locating articles in the anaesthetics field: 'Perturbation of ion transport'. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 43: 814, Cawkell, A. E. (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
[[Citation]] is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.
Citation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called "Research Reviews".&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/publications/papers/CMU-ECE-2011-017.pdf Structures and Statistics of Citation Networks, Miray Kas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and figures&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; ==
* Citation networks are directed. The links go from one document to the other. 
* Citation networks are acyclic because a paper can cite only existing papers.
* All edges in the citation networks point backwards in time.
* Links in co-authorship networks are reciprocal (symmetric).
* The link weights between two authors in co-authorship networks can increase over time if they have further collaboration.
* Vertices and edges added to the citation/co-authorship networks are permanent and cannot be removed at a later time. 
* The already formed part of the network is mostly static and only the leading edge of the network changes.

'''Comparative research''' is a research methodology in the [[social science]]s that aims to make comparisons across different [[country|countries]] or [[culture]]s. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of [[poverty]]).

== Development of the tradition ==

As Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of ''episteme'' and ''philo-sophia'', as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. ''Episteme'', as a form and activity in the field of ''logos'', marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) ‘On comparative inquiry: the Ancient Greek origins’. Research paper presented at the conference of the Comparative Education Society in Europe (CESE), Freiburg, Germany, 11/06/14 - 14/06/14. &lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic ''polis''. Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ ''Histories'' demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. ''isegoria'' and ''parrhesia''), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According also to [[Karl Deutsch]], we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"&gt;Deutsch 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.

Textbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;Clasen 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antal, Dierkes &amp; Weiler 1987: 13&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. [[Globalization]] has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. [[Information technology]] has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.&lt;ref&gt;Øyen 2004: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative research defined ==
Comparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"&gt;Heidenheimer, Heclo &amp; Adams 1983: 505&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a "seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esping"&gt;Esping-Andersen 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clasen"/&gt; The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1990: 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate "grand theories," such as [[Marxism]]. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related.&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski &amp; Teune 1970: 31&lt;/ref&gt; The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of [[decommodification]]. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy.&lt;ref name="Esping"/&gt; Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.

Comparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"/&gt; Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.

The [[historical comparative research]] involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

When it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''comparison microscope''' is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two [[microscope]]s connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.

==History==
In the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

===Col. Calvin H. Goddard===
{{Main|Calvin Hooker Goddard}}
[[Image:goddardcomparison-wiki.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Goddard with comparison microscope]] Philip O. Gravelle, a [[chemist]], developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired [[bullets]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of [[firearms]] identification in [[forensic science]]. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], breach block, [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], or [[firing pin]] in the [[gun]]. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. "As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work." Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Thorwald, '''The Century of the Detective''', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sir Sydney Smith]] also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to [[Scotland]] and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.

==Modern comparison microscope==
The modern instrument has many [[optical]], [[Machine|mechanical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] refinements, including [[fiber optic]] illumination, [[video]] capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single [[firearm]] based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a "no conclusion" result if insufficient marks are present.&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;John H. Dillon, Jr , Comparison Microscopy: The Origins of Firearms identification, A Practical Application of Forensic Science, Technology and Engineering to Case Linkage in Shooting Incidents Not Previously Related by Investigative personnel, BulletTRAX-3D, MatchPoint Plus and the Firearms Examiner, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match [[bullet]]s and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of [[forensic science]].

Visualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.

==Forensic ballistics==
{{Main|Ballistics}}

The prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the [[United States]] compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As with most firearms, the fired [[ammunition]] components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as "ballistics".

Historically, and currently, this [[forensic ballistics|forensic discipline]] ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired [[bullet]]s or [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]], one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.

The interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called [[Rifling#Manufacture|rifling]]) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called "lands" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a "signature" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this "signature" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.

When a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a [[crime scene]], forensic examiners compare the [[Ballistic fingerprinting|ballistic fingerprint]] of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.

==Notable cases==
===Sacco and Vanzetti case===
{{Main|Sacco and Vanzetti}}
Forensic innovator [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure [[conviction]]s of accused murderers and anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]]. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the [[electric chair]]. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the [[Capital punishment|executions]] and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a [[semi-automatic pistol]] could be traced by several different methods if both [[bullet]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|casing]] were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by [[firing pin]] indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] in 1927.
Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect [[gun barrel]]s, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.
In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.

===St. Valentine's Day massacre===
{{Main|St. Valentine's Day Massacre}}
Colonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in which seven gangsters were killed by rival [[Al Capone]] [[mobster]]s dressed as [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at [[Northwestern University]] and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, [[ballistics]], [[fingerprinting]], blood analysis and [[trace evidence]] were all brought under one roof.
In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.

[[Professional wrestling]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (Also known as MMA) both combine [[grappling]] and [[strike (attack)|strikes]]. In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often [[scripted]] or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA.

==Comparison==
Professional wrestling could be considered a [[performance art]] which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling |work=Mythologies |year=1957 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of [[amateur wrestling]], striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a "worked" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century [[Europe]] as a carnival attraction.

Mixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[Martial Arts]], such as [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. The early 1990s saw the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] popularize the term "Mixed Martial Arts", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/mma-dragon-sleeper-finish-video/ | title=An MMA Fighter Won A Fight With A Shoot Dragon Sleeper | work=Uproxx.com | date=November 12, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Hanstock, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is [[Brock Lesnar]], who has won the world championships in both the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Couture|date=September 2, 2008|last=Spade|first=Bobby|accessdate=September 2, 2008|publisher=NoDQ.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906152912/http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|archivedate=September 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/19/16793746/ufc-brock-lesnar-return-wwe-jim-ross-pro-wrestling-mma-news | title=Jim Ross: Fans are ‘jonesing’ for Lesnar’s UFC return because MMA is lacking superstars right now | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=December 19, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Ordoñez, Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include [[Bobby Lashley]] ([[Shark Fights#Current champions|Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship]]&lt;ref name="Shark-Win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2011/11/12/bobby-lashley-wins-mma-title-in-lubbock/|title=Bobby Lashley wins MMA title in Lubbock|publisher=Gerweck.net|first=Steve|last=Gerweck|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Impact Global Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0811/615430/tna-impact-wrestling-results/|title=TNA Impact Wrestling Results (8/11): Damien Sandow TNA Debut, Titles Vs.

===Rivalry===
Since MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.&lt;ref name="BloodyElbow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/18/16793536/ufc-daniel-cormier-disses-pro-wrestling-spots-gets-into-twitter-beef-with-cody-rhodes-mma-news | title=Daniel Cormier disses pro wrestling spots, gets into Twitter beef with Cody Rhodes | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=Dec 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Burke, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}
A '''contraction''' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s nor [[acronym]]s (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Hart's Rules|New Hart's Rules]]: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal}} {{rp|p.167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraction is also distinguished from [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
{{main|English auxiliaries and contractions}}

[[English language|English]] has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an [[apostrophe]] in writing), as in ''I'm'' for "I am", and sometimes other changes as well, as in ''won't'' for "will not" or ''ain't'' for "am not". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of "o'clock").

The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]]).

|-
| you
| y'-

|}

Some other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of [[elision]], may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as ''wanna'' for ''want to'', ''gonna'' for ''going to'', ''y'all'' for ''you all'',  ''ya'll'' for ''ya all'' in the [[Southern United States]] and others common forms in colloquial speech.

In [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of ''He won't go'' is '''''Won't he''' go'', whereas the uncontracted equivalent is ''Will he not go?'', with ''not'' following the subject.

== Chinese ==

Contractions exist in [[Classical Chinese]], some of which are used in modern Chinese.

Contractions also appear in [[Cantonese]], for example, 乜嘢&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%E4%B9%9C%E5%98%A2&amp;oldid=27284238|title=乜嘢|publisher=|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 咩.

== French ==

The [[French language]] has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in ''[[wiktionary:c'est la vie|C'est la vie]]'' ("That's life"), where ''c'est'' stands for ''ce'' + ''est'' ("that is"). The formation of these contractions is called [[Elision (French)|elision]].

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in ''[[e caduc]]'' (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, ''h'' or ''y'' (as ''h'' is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; ''y'' sounds like ''i''). In addition to ''ce'' → ''c'-'' (demonstrative pronoun "that"), these words are ''que'' → ''qu'-'' (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun "that"), ''ne'' → ''n'-'' ("not"), ''se'' → ''s'-'' ("himself", "herself", "itself", "oneself" before a verb), ''je'' → ''j'-'' ("I"), ''me'' → ''m'-'' ("me" before a verb), ''te'' → ''t'- '' (informal singular "you" before a verb), ''le'' or ''la'' → ''l'-'' ("the"; or  "he/she", "it" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''), and ''de'' → ''d'-'' ("of"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) ''*ce est'' or ''*que elle''.

''Moi'' ("myself") and ''toi'' (informal "yourself") mandatorily contract to ''m'-'' and ''t'-'' respectively after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction ''si'' ("if") is followed by ''il'' ("he", "it") or ''ils'' ("they"), which begin with the same vowel sound ''i'': ''*si il'' → ''s'il'' ("if it", if he"); ''*si ils'' → ''s'ils'' ("if they").

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: ''au'' for ''à le'', ''aux'' for ''à les'', ''du'' for ''de le'', and ''des'' for ''de les''. However, the contraction of ''cela'' (demonstrative pronoun "that") to ''ça'' is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, ''je ne sais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʒənəsɛpa|IPA}}, "I don't know") may be pronounced roughly ''chais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛpa|IPA}}), with the ''ne'' being completely elided and the {{IPA-fr|ʒ|}} of ''je'' being mixed with the {{IPA-fr|s|}} of ''sais''.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}  It is also common in informal contexts to contract ''tu'' to ''t'-'' before a vowel, e.g., ''t'as mangé'' for ''tu as mangé''.

== Hebrew ==

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In [[Modern Hebrew|colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter.  Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, "I saw the dog") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

== Italian ==

In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions ''a'', ''da'', ''di'', ''in'', ''su'', ''con'' and ''per'' combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely ''il'', ''lo'', ''la'', ''l','' ''i'', ''gli'', ''gl','' and ''le''.

* Contractions with a, da, di, in, and su are mandatory, but those with con and per are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer commonly used, but some still exist in common expressions such as ''colla voce''.
* Formerly, ''gl''' was used before words beginning with ''i'', however it is no longer in common use.

The words ''ci'' and ''è'' (form of ''essere'', to be) and the words ''vi'' and ''è'' are contracted into ''c'è'' and ''v'è'' (both meaning "there is").
* “''C'è'' / ''V'è'' un problema”&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There is a problem

The words ''dove'' and any word that begins with ''e'' are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally ''come'' does be made so.
As well other words may be contracted the same these two, like ''quale'', and other ones, etcetera.

== Spanish ==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: ''al'' (to the) for ''a el'', and ''del'' (of the) for ''de el'' (not to be confused with ''a él'', meaning ''to him'', and ''de él'', meaning ''his'' or, more literally, ''of him'').

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being ''de'' + personal and demonstrative pronouns: ''destas'' for ''de estas'' (of these, fem.), ''daquel'' for ''de aquel'' (of that, masc.), ''dél'' for ''de él'' (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with ''a-'': ''l'alma'' for ''la alma'', now ''el alma'' (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of ''aquí'' (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + ''otro/a'' (other): ''aqueste'', ''aqueso'', ''estotro'' etc. The modern ''aquel'' (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns ''nosotros'' (we) and ''vosotros'' (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: ''todol'' for ''todo el'' (all the, masc.), ''ques'' for ''que es'' (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as ''conmigo'' for *''con mí'' (with me), ''contigo'' for *''con ti'' (with you sing.), ''consigo'' for *''con sí'' (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).

Finally, one can hear {{clarify|reason=in which dialects?|date=January 2014}} ''pa''' for ''para'', deriving as ''pa'l'' for ''para el'', but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, ''de'' (of) and ''por'' (by; formerly ''per'') combine with the definite articles ''o'' and ''a'' (masculine and feminine forms of "the" respectively), producing ''do'', ''da'' (of the), ''pelo'', ''pela'' (by the). The preposition ''de'' contracts with the pronouns ''ele'' and ''ela'' (he, she), producing ''dele'', ''dela'' (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb ''amar'' (to love) combines with the pronoun ''a'' (her), giving ''amá-la'' (to love her).

Another contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun ''da'' with words starting in ''a'', resulting in changing the first letter ''a'' for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: ''Estrela d'alva'' (A popular phrase to refer to [[Venus]] that means "Alb star", as a reference to its brightness) ; ''Caixa d'água'' (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken [[German language|German]] [[prepositional phrase]]s, one can often merge the preposition and the [[article (grammar)|article]]; for example, ''von dem'' becomes ''vom'', ''zu dem'' becomes ''zum'', or ''an das'' becomes ''ans''. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, ''aufm'' for ''auf dem'', ''unterm'' for ''unter dem'', etc. are also  used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun ''es'' often contracts to ''{{'}}s'' (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting ''Wie geht es?'' is usually encountered in the contracted form ''Wie geht's?''.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===

[[Dialectology|Regional dialects]] of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's [[Standard German]] was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as ''in den'' becoming ''in'n'' (sometimes ''im'') or ''haben wir'' becoming ''hamwer'', ''hammor'', ''hemmer'', or ''hamma'' depending on local intonation preferences. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]] features several more contractions such as ''gesund sind wir'' becoming ''xund samma'' which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German ''wir'' exists alongside Bavarian ''mir'', or ''mia'', with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has as his catchphrase "Schau mer mal" ("Schauen wir einmal" - in English "let's have a look"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, "Schau'n Mer Mal".

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: ''Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?'' is spoken as ''Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?''

Several [[West Central German]] dialects along the [[Rhine River]] have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of [[liaison (French)|"liaison"]] is used. So, ''[Dat] kriegst Du nicht'' may become ''Kressenit'', or ''Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt'' may become ''Lomejon haschjesaat''.

Mostly, there are no binding [[orthography|orthographies]] for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to  degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are "jakke" for "jeg har ikke", meaning "I do not have" and "dække" for "det er ikke", meaning "there is not". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] words like {{wt|nb|jeg}}, {{wt|nb|du}}, {{wt|nb|deg}}, {{wt|nb|det}}, {{wt|nb|har}} or {{wt|nb|ikke}}. The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is "Det ordner seg av seg selv" in standard written [[Bokmål]], meaning "It will sort itself out" could become "dånesæsæsjæl" (note the letters [[Å]] and [[Æ]], and the word "sjæl", as an [[eye dialect]] spelling of {{wt|nb|selv}}). [[R-dropping]], being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway {{which|date=March 2018}}, but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like {{IPA|/ə/}}.

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official [[Norwegian orthography|orthography]]. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb ''nolo'' (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of ''non volo'' (''volo'' meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (''-ssu'') for です (''desu'') and すいません (''suimasen'') for すみません (''sumimasen''). では (''dewa'') is often contracted to じゃ (''ja''). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (''no'') is contracted to simply ん (''n'').

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (''-te''), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:

|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated ''ikimasu'' (go) and the verb ''kimasu'' (come).

The ending ～なければ (''-nakereba'') can be contracted to ～なきゃ (''-nakya'') when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (''ikanakya (ikenai)'') "I have to go."

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (''nanika'') "something" is contracted to なんか (''nanka'') to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of "sort of," but which can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English "like."
* じゃない (''ja nai'') "is not" is contracted to じゃん (''jan'') which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker's belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (''ii jan!'') "What, it's fine!"
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (''to iu'') is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (''-tte/-te/-ttsū'') to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (''to ieba''), the conditional form of という (''to iu'') mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (''-tte ba'') to show the speaker's annoyance at the listener's failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (''mō ii tte ba!''), “I already told you I don't want to talk about it anymore!”.
* The common words だ (''da'') and です (''desu'') are older contractions that originate from である (''de aru'') and でございます (''de gozaimasu''). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (''de aru'') is used in place of だ (''da'').
* The [[Japanese pronouns|first-person singular pronoun]] 私 is pronounced わたくし (''watakushi'') in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(''watashi'') in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women's speech to あたし (''atashi'').

Various [[Japanese dialects|dialects of Japanese]] also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==

In the [[Polish language]] pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are ''go'' and ''mu''. The non-contracted forms are ''jego'' (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and ''jemu'', respectively. The [[clitic]] ''-ń'' which stands for ''niego'' (him) as in ''dlań'' (''dla niego'') is more common in literature.  The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ksiazka.pdf (p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uyghur ==

[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]], includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of [[compound verb]]s ([[serial verb construction|serial verbs]]). For instance, ''sëtip alidu'' (sell-manage, "manage to sell") is usually written and pronounced ''sëtivaldu'', with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] [[lenition|leniting]] into a [v] or [w].{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like "at" and "ay." In this chart, the "@" represents any vowel.

{{wiktionary}}
The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30866">[[Cryptic crossword]]s often use [[abbreviation]]s to clue individual letters or short fragments of the overall solution. These include:

*Any conventional abbreviations found in a standard dictionary, such as:
**"current": &lt;small&gt;AC&lt;/small&gt; (for "alternating current"); less commonly, &lt;small&gt;DC&lt;/small&gt; (for "direct current"); or even &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in physics and electronics)
*[[Roman numerals]]: for example the word "six" in the clue might be used to indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;VI&lt;/small&gt;
*The name of a [[chemical element]] may be used to signify its symbol; e.g., [[tungsten]] for &lt;small&gt;W&lt;/small&gt;
*[[Country codes]]: "Switzerland" can indicate the letters &lt;small&gt;CH&lt;/small&gt;
*[[ICAO spelling alphabet]]: where Mike signifies &lt;small&gt;M&lt;/small&gt; and Romeo &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;
*Conventional abbreviations for US cities and states: for example, New York can indicate &lt;small&gt;NY&lt;/small&gt; and "California" &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CAL&lt;/small&gt;.

The abbreviation is not always a short form of the word used in the clue. For example:

*"Knight" for &lt;small&gt;N&lt;/small&gt; (the symbol used in chess notation)

Taking this one stage further, the clue word can hint at the word or words to be abbreviated rather than giving the word itself. For example:

*"About" for &lt;small&gt;C&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;CA&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviations of "circa", meaning "about". "About" can also be abbreviated to &lt;small&gt;RE&lt;/small&gt;, for "regarding".
*"Say" for &lt;small&gt;EG&lt;/small&gt;, used to mean "for example".

More obscure clue words of this variety include:

*"Model" for &lt;small&gt;T&lt;/small&gt;, referring to the [[Model T]].
*"Beginner" or synonyms such as "novice" or "student" for &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;, as in [[L-plate]].
*"Bend" for &lt;small&gt;S&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;U&lt;/small&gt; (as in "S-bend" and "U-bend")
*"Books" for &lt;small&gt;OT&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NT&lt;/small&gt;, as in Old Testament or New Testament.
*"Sailor" for &lt;small&gt;AB&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of able-bodied.
*"Take" for &lt;small&gt;R&lt;/small&gt;, abbreviation of the Latin word ''recipe'', meaning "take".

'''Diels–Kranz''' ('''DK''') '''numbering''' is the standard system for referencing the works of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, based on the collection of quotations from and reports of their work, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' ('''''The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), by [[Hermann Alexander Diels]]. The ''Fragmente'' was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by [[Walther Kranz]] and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses [[Sophist|Sophists]] and [[Homer|pre-Homeric]] poets such as [[Orpheus]].

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Plato]], and [[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Aristotle]].

== Background ==
The works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as [[doxography]]) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of [[Thales of Miletus]] comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is [[Hippolytus of Rome]], whose polemic ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' is a source of many direct quotations of [[Heraclitus]] as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.

These quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.

== Numbering system ==
The number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:

# a number representing the personality the item is concerned with - this number is also the chapter number in the ''Fragmente''.  For example, "11", also the eleventh chapter of the ''Fragmente'', refers to [[Thales]].
# the letter ''A'', ''B'', or ''C'', corresponding to the type of item given, respectively:
#:A: ''Testimonia'': These are accounts of the authors' life and doctrines. ''Testimonia'' include commentaries on the works of the pre-Socratics and accounts of their lives and of their philosophical views.
#:B: ''Ipsissima Verba'': Literally translated to "exact words", and sometimes also termed "fragments", these are items containing exact words of the author in the form of quotations in later works.
#:C: ''Imitations'': Works which take the author as a model.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/diels-kr/|title=IEP: "Diels-Kranz Numbering System"|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a number representing the position of the particular item in its chapter.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0172:text=Theaet.:page=174|title=Plato, Theaetetus, page 174|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (one of [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]]), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a ''testimonium'', represented by the letter ''A''. Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.

Sometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|wslink=Fragments_of_Heraclitus#Fragment_22|title=Fragments of Heraclitus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than "22B22" the above may also instead be referred to as "Heraclitus B22" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the ''Fragmente''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/heraclit|title=Heraclitus|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table==

The following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1959 |title=The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Companion to Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' (Second Ed.) |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=v-vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1971 |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A complete translation of the Fragments in Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=vii-ix |quote=1971 Importation, SBN 674-03500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/app/app01.htm |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: Contents |website=[[Internet Sacred Text Archive|Sacred Texts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |date=2000 |title=The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and the Sophists |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=345-349 |isbn=9780199539093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Kathleen Freeman (classicist)|Kathleen Freeman]] adopted the fifth edition's numberings for both her ''Companion'' and ''Ancilla'', while also reproducing the fourth edition's numberings in parentheses.  A matching online version of the ''Ancilla's'' table of contents is available at Sacred Texts, for reference.  Later, [[Robin Waterfield]] prepared a new Pre-Socratic reader, which uses an entirely different scheme unrelated to Diels-Kranz.  Nevertheless, Waterfield gives a partial concordance of his own scheme with that of Diels-Kranz, and the partial DK numbering given by Waterfield matches the fifth-edition ''Fragmente'' numbering used by Freeman, so far as it is taken in Waterfield's case.}}  Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', the first to be revised by Kranz.  The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article.  It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the ''Fragmente''.{{efn|For one example of a variant edition and numbering scheme, see ix-x in the following link.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/diefragmenteder00krangoog |title=Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker |date=1903 |website=[[Internet Archive|archive.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context.  Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry.  Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts.  Although "the Seven Sages of Greece" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates.  If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors.  The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and 
per Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman's ''Companion'', 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving ''paraphrases'' of any of their ideas, or what they might have written.  That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.

A '''ditloid''' is a type of [[word puzzle]],&lt;ref name="Ditloids" /&gt; in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated.&lt;ref name="Ditloids"&gt;http://www.ditloids.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2013}} The name 'ditloid' was given by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref name=Ditloids /&gt; originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich|1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.

==History==
[[Will Shortz]] originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]], calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of "What's hot and what's not," [[Us Magazine|''Us'' magazine]] named the Equation Analysis Test in the "what's hot" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from ''Games'' (word for word, except for my byline),
photocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,
and circulated around the country. ''Games'' readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending
it back to ''Games'' as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in [[Morgan Worthy]]'s 1975 book ''AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking'' (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
!style="width:250px;text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Puzzle&lt;/u&gt;
!style="text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|M. + M. + N.H. + V. + C. + R.I = N.E.
|[[Maine]] + [[Massachusetts]] + [[New Hampshire]] + [[Vermont]] + [[Connecticut]] + [[Rhode Island]] = [[New England]]
|-
|"1B. in the H. = 2 in the B."
|"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" (a [[proverb]])
|-
|N. + V. + P. + A. + A. + C. + P. + I. = P. of S.
|[[noun]] + [[verb]] + [[pronoun]] + [[adjective]] + [[adverb]] + [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] + [[preposition]]  + [[interjection]] = [[Parts of Speech]]
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Worthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity
of this puzzle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had
written in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the
University of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized
the format was a good one for eliciting the "aha effect". After that I
used such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on
creative thinking.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is
that the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in
an incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly
see an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral
rather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had
the answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously
thinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about
to fall asleep.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge
on obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, "I
could never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it."
There is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer
inside and just need to find it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chris Messina - South by Southwest 2010 (1).jpg|alt=Chris Messina proposed the use of hashtags in his famous 2007 tweet. |thumb|Chris Messina, the inventor of the hashtag. |440x440px]]A '''hashtag''' is a type of [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tag]] used on [[Social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Twitter]] and other [[microblogging]] services, allowing users to apply [[wikt:dynamic#Adjective|dynamic]], [[user-generated content|user-generated]] tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores.&lt;ref name="charset"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hashtags.org/featured/what-characters-can-a-hashtag-include/|title=What Characters Can A Hashtag Include?|author=|date=|website=hashtags.org|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsia-Ching|last2=Iyer|first2=Hemalata|title=Trends in Twitter - Hashtag Applications: Design Features for Value-Added Dimensions to Future Library Catalogues|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/485537|journal=Library Trends|volume=61|issue=1|pages=248–258|doi=10.1353/lib.2012.0024|issn=1559-0682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on the [[photo sharing|photo-sharing]] service [[Instagram]], the hashtag ''#bluesky'' allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag.  

The use of hashtags was first proposed by [[Chris Messina (open-source advocate)|Chris Messina]] in a 2007 tweet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412|title=🅲🅷🆁🅸🆂 🅼🅴🆂🆂🅸🅽🅰︎ on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, although initially decried by Twitter as a "thing for nerds"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/decade-ago-hashtag-reshaped-internet-180964605/|title=A Decade Ago, the Hashtag Reshaped the Internet|last=Panko|first=Ben|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eventually led to their use spreading like wild-fire through the platform.

So much so that Instagram had to officially place a "30 hashtags" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.instagram.com/351460621611097|title=How do I use hashtags? {{!}} Instagram Help Center|website=help.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a limit which [[Instagrammer|Instagrammers]] eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itchban.com/blog/2017/1/7/instagram-max-hashtags-how-to-post-up-to-60|title=Instagram Max Hashtags: How to post up to 60|work=itchban|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites|title=Website Ranking: Top Websites Rank In The World - SimilarWeb|website=www.similarweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is highly common with [[millennials]], [[Generation Z|Gen Z]], politicians, [[Influencer marketing|influencers]], and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, ''hashtag'' was added to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/13/hashtag_added_to_the_oed/|title='Hashtag' added to the OED – but # isn't a hash, pound, nor number sign|date=June 13, 2014|work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|title=New words notes June 2014|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007085108/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2014-update/new-words-notes-june-2014/|archivedate=October 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''hashtag'' is also sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/389023#eid301493073|title=Oxford English Dictionary – Hash|date=June 2014|work=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]] by the markup that hashtags provide; this process is called [[folksonomy]].
== Origin and use ==
The [[Number sign|US pound sign, number sign or hash symbol]] "#" is often used in [[information technology]] to highlight a special meaning. ("Pound sign" in the UK means "[[£]]"; "#" is called hash, gate, and occasionally [[octothorpe]].) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the assembly language of the [[PDP-11]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] used ''#'' in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] for special keywords that had to be processed first by the [[C preprocessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The C Programming Language]]|authors=B.W. Kernighan &amp; d. Ritchie|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1978|pages=86 and 207|isbn=0-13-110163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 [[SGML]] standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data.[[File:Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (14203190979).jpg|thumb|A sign suggesting the use of a #TimeToAct hashtag at a 2014 conference|alt=|440x440px]]

The International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-E.161-198811-S!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |title=Recommendation E.161 - Arrangement of figures, letters and symbols on telephones and other devices that can be used for gaining access to a telephone network  |publisher=ITU |date=November 25, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pound sign was adopted for use within [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics.&lt;ref&gt;"Channel Scope". Section 2.2. {{IETF RFC|2811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an [[ampersand]] '&amp;').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Internet Relay Chat Protocol |rfc=1459 |sectionname=Channels |section=1.3 |page= |last1=Oikarinen |first1=Jarkko |authorlink1=Jarkko Oikarinen |last2=Reed |first2=Darren |authorlink2= |year=1993 |month=May |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the pound sign in IRC inspired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/summer/originstory.shtml |title=#OriginStory|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Messina (open source advocate)|Chris Messina]] to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/fashion/hashtags-a-new-way-for-tweets-cultural-studies.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Twitter's Secret Handshake | work=The New York Times | date=June 10, 2011 | accessdate=July 26, 2011 | author=Parker, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted the first hashtag on Twitter:
{{quote |1=How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? |author = Chris Messina |source = ("factoryjoe"), August 23, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/223115412|title = Twitter post|author = Chris Messina ("factoryjoe")|date = August 23, 2007&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 50% |align  = center }}
Messina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the [[2007 California wildfires#San Diego County|2007 San Diego forest fires]] in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ What is hashtag?"], Mashable, 8 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factoryjoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factoryjoe.com/2007/10/22/twitter-hashtags-for-emergency-coordination-and-disaster-relief/|title=Twitter hashtags for emergency coordination and disaster relief|website=Factory Joe|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for "lay" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag "was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Kate|date=May 1, 2015|title=The pragmatics of hashtags: Inference and conversational style on Twitter|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037821661500096X|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=81|pages=8–20|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2015.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.

Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-language hashtags in communications during the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The story of the hashtag began with Iranians|url=http://www.dw.de/حکایت-هشتگی-که-ایرانیان-آغاز-کردند/g-18012627|accessdate=March 12, 2015|publisher=Deutsche Welle Persian|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stoweboyd.com/post/39877198249/hash-tags-twitter-groupings |title=Stowe Boyd, Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings |publisher=Stoweboyd.com |date= |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]], chair of the [[American Dialect Society]]'s New Words Committee.

Beginning July 2, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter Makes Hashtags More #Useful|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/twitter-makes-hashtags-more-useful/|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to [[spamming|spam]] the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |title=The Secret of Twitter's Trending Hashtags With Insight and Tips |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/12/tech/social-media/facebook-hashtags/index.html|title=Facebook finally gets #hashtags - CNN.com|last=Mashable|first=By Christina Warren|website=CNN|access-date=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
A hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space, or end of message. It is always safe to precede the “#” with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores.{{r|charset}} In many cases other characters are also allowed, in particular accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another, and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&amp;Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&amp;, or #Romeo&amp;Juliet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |title=Hashtag Standards|website=Terence Eden's Blog|date=25 February 2010|author=Terence Eden|accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtags are not case sensitive; a search for “#hashtag” will find “#HashTag”. The use of embedded capitals ([[CamelCase]]) increases readability and avoids confusion; a (real) pen shop would be advised to use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penisland.net/ |title=Pen Island Pens - Home |website=Penisland.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= 21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g. “It is #sunny today”).

Languages which do not use letters are handled slightly differently. In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by  [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我&amp;#8204;#爱&amp;#8204;你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the "absolute maximum", and any contribution exceeding this risks "raising the ire of the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a (#) Hashtag?|url=http://www.hashtags.org/how-to/history/what-is-a-hashtag/|publisher=Hashtags.org|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=September 22, 2017|quote=if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57dzaMaouXA |title="#Hashtag" with Jimmy Fallon &amp; Justin Timberlake (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

[[File:Seguir hashtags.png|thumb|Search bar in the header of a social networking site, searching for most recent posts containing the hashtag #science|alt=|440x440px]]

Hashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can "trend" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the "Trending Topics" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be "retired" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.

Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.

Hashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and "follow" (subscribe) or "list" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.

Television broadcasters such as [[Channel 4]] have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as [[First Dates]] and [[The Undateables]]. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.

Hashtags can be used on the social network [[Instagram]], by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular [[subaltern]] communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Olszanowski, M. (2014). "Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}}". ''Visual Communication Quarterly,'' 21(1), 83–95. Retrieved February 8, 2015, from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154#.VNgGT7DF-7FF-7F&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous Youtube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.

Hashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikström|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. "My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with "It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, "BREAKING: US GDP growth is back! #kidding". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: "Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility," where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skase.sk/Volumes/JTL28/pdf_doc/05.pdf|title=The ‘hashtag’: A new word or a new rule?|last=Caleffi|first=Paola-Maria|date=|website=Skase Journal of Theoretical Linguistics|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on [[YouTube]] and [[Gawker Media]]. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gawker.com/5382267/anarchy-in-the-machine-welcome-to-gawkers-open-forums|title = Anarchy in the Machine: Welcome to Gawker's Open Forums|author = Gabriel Snyder|publisher = Gawker|date = October 15, 2009&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/got-a-tip-gawker-media-opens-tag-pages-to-masses-expecting-chaos/|title = Got a #tip?

Seward|publisher = Nieman Journalism Lab|date = October 15, 2009 &lt;!-- 8 a.m. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time search aggregators such as the former [[Google Real-Time Search]] also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the "river" of Twitter posts that can result from search terms or hashtags.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Uses ==

=== Broadcast media ===

The use of hashtags has extended to [[television]]{{nsmdns}}a concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen [[digital on-screen graphic|bug]], encouraging viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|title = New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|date = April 21, 2011&lt;!-- 3:25 PM--&gt;|author = Michael Schneider|publisher = TV Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|title = McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|date = December 3, 2012|author = Todd Wasserman|publisher = Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or "branded" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., [[The Ed Show|#edshow]] as well as [[Ed Schultz|@edshow]]) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to "trend" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia|#SunnyFX]]) and instantaneous, "temporary" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1747437/twitter-tv-hashtag-tips-twitters-own-expert|title = Twitter TV Hashtag Tips From Twitter's Own Expert|author = Gregory Ferenstein|date = April 15, 2011|publisher = Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen television ratings system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-chatter-correlates-tv-ratings-good-or-bad-news-nielsen-1144311 |title=Twitter Chatter Correlates With TV Ratings, But Is That Good Or Bad News For Nielsen? |work=International Business Times |date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of trending "temporary" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]], a variety [[talk show]] on [[NBC]]. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called "Tonight Show Hashtags," which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the "Tonight Show Hashtags" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "[[Index term|keywords]]" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords — But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late-night television comedy [[game show]] [[@midnight]] with [[Chris Hardwick]] on [[Comedy Central]] features a daily game entitled "Hashtag Wars," in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.

Some hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan "''[[Je suis Charlie]],''" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with ''Charlie Hebdo'' offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.

=== Purchasing ===

Since February 2013 Twitter and [[American Express]] have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kelly | last = Heather | title = Twitter and Amex let you pay with a hashtag | date = February 12, 2013 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/11/tech/social-media/twitter-hashtag-purchases/| work = CNN | accessdate = November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |title=Sync with Twitter |publisher=Amex Sync |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121304/https://sync.americanexpress.com/Twitter/Index |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Event promotion ===

[[File:Occupy for Rights.JPG|thumb|[[Stencil graffiti]] promoting the hashtag #OccupyForRights|alt=|440x440px]]

Organized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.

Companies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.

Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] as the "#HELSINKI2018 Meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumer complaints ===
Hashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms  to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term "bashtag" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag  to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | accessdate = June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentiment analysis ===
The use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets? Investigating the impact of sarcasm on sentiment analysis|journal=Proceedings of the Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a difficult [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] problem.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/power-yourself-with-viral-marketing-become-a-hashtag_us_57bf13e6e4b06384eb3e7f1d?dxrywr9zcw30rizfr|title=Power yourself with viral marketing - become a HashTag Genius &amp;#124; HuffPost|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
The YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, [[Hashtag United F.C.]].

Since the 2012–13 season, the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/11/15/2014-nba-all-star-ballot-official-release/|title=NBA and Sprint tip off NBA All-Star Balloting 2014|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2013|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bird's Eye]] foods released in 2014 a shaped [[mashed potato]] food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called "Mashtags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds Eye launches Mashtags – social media potato shapes|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fmcg/birds-eye-launches-mashtags-potato-shapes/354514.article|work=The Grocer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations,&lt;ref name="macmillandictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/hashtag|title=hashtag (noun) definition and synonyms|website=Macmillan Dictionary|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as "I’m hashtag confused!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about a new [[hand gesture]] that mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the "finger hashtag", in which both hands form a [[Peace sign#The V sign|peace sign]], and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2012/aug/01/how-to-say-hashtag-fingers |title=How to say 'hashtag' with your fingers |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Tom Meltzer |date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging gesture was reported about in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' by [[Nimrod Kamer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-03/06/hashtags |title=Finger-Hashtags |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=March 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by [[Jimmy Fallon]], and on ''[[The Colbert Report]],'' among other programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/finger-hashtag-jimmy-fallon-twitter/ |title=I invented finger hashtags—and I regret nothing |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |author=[[Nimrod Kamer]] |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a [[fad]], but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Adaptations ===
*Hashflags: In 2010, Twitter introduced "hashflags" during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |title=Twitter Supports World Cup Fever with Hashflags |publisher=Ryanseacrest.com |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129201517/http://ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |archivedate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reintroduced the feature on June 10, 2014, in time for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howto.digidefen.se/twitter/What-are-hashflags.php |title=What are Hashflags? |publisher=Howto.digidefen.se |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Woods |url=https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2014/06/10/twitter-brings-back-hashflags-just-time-world-cup-2014-kick/ |title=Twitter brings back hashflags just in time for World Cup 2014 kick-off |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=June 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again on April 10, 2015, with UK political party logos for the 2015 UK General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter just launched election hashflags|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32249518/twitter-just-launched-election-hashflags|website=BBC News|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a user tweets a hashtag consisting of the three letter country code of any of the 32 countries represented in the tournament, Twitter automatically embeds a flag emoticon for that country. A similar system was implemented for the 2015 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Twitter hashflags go live!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_twitter_hashflags_go_live|website=eurovision.tv|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used for discussion of currency pairings on Twitter, e.g. using #USDGBP or $USDGBP,  when mentioning the US Dollar's level expressed in Pounds Sterling.

The pronoun '''''I''''' {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[nominative case]] [[personal pronoun]] in [[Modern English]].  It is used to refer to one's [[self]] and is [[capitalization|capitalized]], although other pronouns, such as ''he'' or ''she'', are not capitalized.

The grammatical variants of ''I'' are ''me'', ''my'', ''mine'', and ''myself''.

==Etymology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2015}}
{{Further|Old English pronouns|Proto-Germanic pronouns|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
English ''I'' originates from [[Old English]] (OE) ''ic''. Its predecessor ''ic'' had in turn originated from the continuation of [[Proto-Germanic]] *''ik'', and ''ek''; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, ''ek'' was attested in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant ''eka''; see also [[ek erilaz]]). Linguists assume ''ik'' to have developed from the unstressed variant of ''ek''. Variants of ''ic'' were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.{{sfn| OED online}}

Germanic cognates are: [[Old Frisian]] ''ik'', [[Old Norse]] ''ek'' ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''jeg'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ég), [[Old High German]] ''ih'' ([[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ich|ich]]'') and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ik'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also "ik".

The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the [[Proto Indo-European language]] (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *''egō, egóm'', with cognates including
[[Sanskrit]] ''aham'', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''uk'', [[Latin]] ''ego'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγώ}} ''egō'', [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''azъ'' and [[Alviri-Vidari language|Alviri-Vidari]] (an Iranian language) {{lang|fa|اَز}} ''az''.

The oblique forms are formed from a stem  ''*me-'' (English ''me''), the plural from ''*wei-'' (English ''we''), the oblique plurals from ''*ns-'' (English ''us'') and from Proto-Germanic ''*unseraz'', PIE ''*no-s-ero-'' (''our, ours'').

== Capitalization ==
''I'' (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English.{{Efn-lr|Other pronouns may be capitalized when referring to the Deity ("God's in His heaven") and, of course, when beginning a sentence. The capitalization of the first person pronoun is distinctive of English, although it is common in other languages to capitalize a second person pronoun, for example ''Sie'' in German.}} This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase ''i'' was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.{{Sfn|Fowler|2015}}

== Case forms ==
{{See also|Objective case#English}}
Like the  other [[English personal pronouns]] ''we'' (''us''), ''he'' (''him''), ''she'' (''her''), and ''they'' (''them''), the pronoun ''I'' has several singular case forms.{{efn-lr |name=Terminology|Terminological note: &lt;br/&gt;Authorities use different terms for the inflectional ([[grammatical case|case]]) forms of the personal pronouns, such as the [[oblique case|oblique-case]] form ''me'', which is used as a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, as well as other uses. For instance, one standard work on English grammar, ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', uses the term ''objective case'', while another, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'', uses the term ''accusative'' case. Similarly, some use the term ''nominative'' for the form ''I'', while others use the term ''subjective''. Some authorities use the term ''genitive'' for forms such as ''my'' where others use the term ''possessive''. Some grammars refer to ''my'' and ''mine'', respectively, as the ''dependent genitive'' and the ''independent genitive'', while others call ''my'' a ''possessive adjective'' and ''mine'' a ''possessive pronoun''.}}
These are:{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}} 
* ''I'', the nominative (or subjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form 
* ''me'', the accusative (or objective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''my'', the dependent genitive (or possessive adjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''mine'', the independent genitive case form (or possessive pronoun{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}})

=== Use of ''I'' and ''me'' ===
There are some situations in which only the nominative form (''I'')  is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (''me'')  is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}}

====Exclusive use of nominative ''I''====
In all varieties of standard English, the nominative form ''I'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative|Not part of a  coordinative construction with ''and'', for instance.}} subject of an ''explicit'' verb,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=458-459}} e.g. 
* "I did it."
not 
* * "Me did it."{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk|The asterisk preceding this example indicates that the utterance is not acceptable in standard English. For an explanation of this linguistic convention, see [[Asterisk#Linguistics]]}}
With other pronouns, such as ''we'' (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}

====Exclusive use of accusative ''me''====
In all varieties of standard English, the accusative form ''me'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative}} direct or indirect object{{efn-lr|including the subject of a non-finite clause introduced by ''for'', e.g. "For me to do that would be more than a crime."}} of a verb or preposition.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}  The accusative ''me'' is also required in a number of constructions such as "Silly me!"{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=461–462}}

====Alternative use of nominative and accusative====
In many situations, both the nominative ''I'' and the accusative ''me'' are encountered.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}

When the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative ''I'' is sometimes encountered in (very)  formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}
* "It is I."
But this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:
* * "This one [photograph] is I as a baby.{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk}}
''Me'' is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "This is me as a baby." 
* "It's me!"
The nominative ''I'' is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "It is I she loves." 
* "It is I who love you." 
though even here ''me'' is more common in non-formal style:
* "It's me she loves." 
* "It's me who loves you."

Following ''as'' or ''than'' (without a following explicit verb),  the accusative form is common:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than me."
However, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and ''than'' or ''as'' as a conjunction, the nominative ''I'' is found in formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than I [am]."

In [[Australian English]], [[British English]] and [[Irish English]], many speakers have an unstressed form of ''my'' that is identical to ''me'' (see [[English personal pronouns#Archaic and non-standard forms|archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns]]).

=====Coordinative constructions=====
The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.
In some  varieties  English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I".{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} So the correct form is 
* "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas."
* "Between you and me ..."

In some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative ''subject'' construction,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} as in
* "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas."
This is highly stigmatized.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462-463}}

On the other hand, the use of the nominative ''I'' in coordinative constructions like "you and I"where ''me'' would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English:{{sfn |Huddleston |Pullum |2002 |p=463}} 
* "President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to meet with him ..."
* "All debts are cleared between you and I".

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".
* In the 1997 movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', the main character, Will Hunting, when arguing for himself in court against the dismissive rebuttals of the prosecuting attorney, cites obscure case law, then follows up by stating "Ibid, your Honour."

'''Leslie Gilbert Pine''' (22 December 1907 – 15 May 1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]], [[lecturer]], and researcher in the areas of [[genealogy]], [[nobility]], history, [[heraldry]] and [[animal welfare]].{{ref|ancestry3}}  He was born in 1907 in [[Bristol]], [[England]] and died in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]] in 1987.  He was the son of Lilian Grace Beswetherick and Henry Moorshead Pine (a tea merchant).{{ref|ancestry1}}

From 1935 to 1940 he served as an assistant [[editing|editor]] at [[Burke's Peerage]] Ltd. During [[World War II]] he was an officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] intelligence branch, serving in [[North Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[India]]; he retired with the rank of Squadron Leader. After the war and until 1960, he was Burke's executive director. Pine edited ''Burke's Peerage,'' 1949-1959; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Great Britain),'' 1952; ''Burke's Landed Gentry (of Ireland),'' 1958; and, ''Burke's Distinguished Families of America,'' 1939, 1947.  He also edited ''The International Year Book and Statesmen's Who's Who,'' 1953-1960; ''Author's and Writer's Who's Who,'' 1948, 1960; ''Who's Who in Music,'' 1949; and, ''Who's Who in the Free Churches,'' 1951.{{ref|pine1}}

A graduate of London University, he became a Barrister-at-Law, Inner Temple, in 1953. Pine was a member of the International Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, a Fellow of the Ancient Monuments Society, a Life Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], and a Liveryman of the Glaziers' Company.  In [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]] he was the unsuccessful [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Bristol Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol Central]].

He was managing editor of a British hunting magazine, ''[[Shooting Times]]'', from 1960 to 1964.{{ref|Times1}} He later authored an important book highly critical of [[sport hunting]], ''After Their Blood'', in which he wrote: "It is our duty as men and women of God’s redeemed creation to try not to increase the suffering of the world, but to lessen it. To get rid of bloodsports will be a great step toward this end."

In 1948 Leslie Pine married Grace V. Griffin (20 August 1914- ). Their only child, [[Richard Pine]], was born in London on 21 August 1949.

[[File:Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng page.png|thumb|upright|A page from the ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever printed]]

The '''''leishu''''' ({{zh|t=類書|l=category books}}) is a genre of [[Reference work|reference books]] historically compiled in China and other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]]. The term is generally translated as "encyclopedia", although the ''leishu'' are quite different from the modern notion of [[encyclopedia]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

== Overview ==

The ''leishu'' are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works,{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} ''Leishu'' may be considered [[anthologies]], but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}}

Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=603}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled was the 1408 ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', containing 370 million [[Chinese characters]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} and the largest ever printed was the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

==History==
[[File:Yongle Dadian Encyclopedia 1403.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled]]

The genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Emperor's mirror"{{efn|Compare the later "[[speculum literature]]" in the Western tradition.}}). Sponsored by the emperor of [[Cao Wei]], it was compiled around 220, but has since [[Lost works|been lost]].{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} However, the term ''leishu'' was not used until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

In later imperial China dynasties, such as the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]], emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single ''leishu'', in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled, on the order of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of Ming, was the ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'' containing a total of 370 million [[Chinese characters]]. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor [[Yao Guangxiao]]. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}}

The ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest ''leishu'' ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}} It was compiled by a team of scholars led by [[Chen Menglei]], and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

The ''riyong leishu'' (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the [[Confucian]] elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

According to [[Jean-Pierre Diény]], the [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing reign]] (1796–1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of ''leishu''.{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==In other countries==
[[File:Sancai Tuhui World Map.jpg|thumb|The world map entitled [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]], from the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', an illustrated ''leishu'']]

Other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] also adopted the genre of ''leishu''. In 1712, the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a richly illustrated ''leishu'' compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (王圻) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]''. The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ryōan (寺島良安), a physician born in [[Osaka]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==Importance==
The ''leishu'' have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a ''leishu'' compilation. The 7th-century ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the ''Yongle Dadian'' is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}} The ''leishu'' also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

==Major compilations==
Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived. Among the most important, in chronological order, are:{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=603–5}}

*''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' (Collection of literature arranged by categories), compiled by [[Ouyang Xun]]
*''[[Beitang Shuchao]]'' (Excerpts from books in the Northern Hall), compiled by [[Yu Shinan]] ca. 630
*''[[Chuxue Ji]]'' (Writings for elementary instruction), compiled by Xu Jian et al. between 713 and 742
*''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' (''Taiping Imperial Reader''), compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] et al., published 984
*''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' (Outstanding models from the storehouse of literature), compiled by [[Wang Qinruo]] et al., completed in 1013
*''[[Yuhai]]'' (Ocean of jade), compiled by [[Wang Yinglin]] 1330–40
*''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', completed 1408, the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled
*''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', 1726–28, the largest ''leishu'' ever printed

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

[[Image:Historylink Ballardlib03.JPG|thumb|right|Librarian, [[Ballard Carnegie Library]], [[Seattle, Washington]] ca. 1907]]

The '''reference desk''' or '''information desk''' of a library is a public service counter where professional [[librarian]]s provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.

==Purpose and usage==
Library users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information.  Using a structured [[reference interview]], the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them.&lt;ref name="reference desk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=Dennis B.|title=Shall We Get Rid Of The Reference Desk?|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly|date=2013|volume=52|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosby|first1=Olivia|title=Librarians: Information Experts in the Information Age|url=http://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2000/Winter/art01.pdf|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.

The ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a [[book]] or [[Academic journal|journal]] article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online [[library catalog|catalog]] or subscription [[bibliographic database|bibliographic/fulltext database]]s, or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online [[reference work|reference collection]].  Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources.&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions.  A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.

The services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.

==History==
Reference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Liya|title=The Evolution of Library Reference Services: From General to Special, 1876-1920's|journal=Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services|date=September 2014|volume=64|issue=3|pages=254–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt; Beginning in 1883 with the [[Boston Public Library]], libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;

One of the earliest proponents of references services was [[Samuel Swett Green]]. He wrote an article titled "Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers" which had a large impact on the future of reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;
then, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor (2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.

==Resources==
Resources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:
* A computer with internet access. Librarians use both the public web and subscription databases to find and evaluate information and research sources. 
* A small collection of [[reference work|reference book]]s (called ''ready reference'') that are most often used, so that the librarians can reach them quickly, especially when they are on the phone, and so that the books will be returned in time for someone else to use later the same day. The library's full reference collection is usually nearby as well.
* Newspaper clipping files and other rare or restricted items that must be returned to the reference desk.
* Index cards with the answers to frequently asked questions, and/or drawers with folders of pamphlets and photocopies of pages that, from previous experience, were difficult to find.  These enable librarians to find such information quickly without leaving the desk—even faster than they could look it up in a reference book or using the Internet.
* Books and other items that are being held for library users who asked the librarian by phone to set them aside for them to pick up later the same day, or within the next few days.
* Books from the circulating collection that have been set aside for students working on a special assignment, and are temporarily designated to be used only within the library until the project is due.
* Printed lists of items in the library that are not in the catalogue, such as newspapers, school yearbooks, old telephone directories, college course catalogues, and local history sources.

==Services==
Services that are often available at a library reference desk include:
* A sign up sheet for reserving computers with Internet access, or [[Word processor|word processing]] software.
* The ability to place the book 'on hold', which prevents the person who has borrowed it from renewing it.  The person who placed the 'hold' is notified when the book has been returned. (Some libraries provide this service at the [[Library circulation|circulation]] desk.)
* The ability to request [[interlibrary loan]] of books and other material from other branch libraries in the same library system, or from a cooperating library anywhere in the world. (Some libraries provide this service at the circulation desk.)
* The opportunity to recommend that the library purchase something for its collection that it doesn't have, which may be needed or of interest to other library users.

The [[librarian]] who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:
* The librarian can look up a brief, factual answer to a specific question.
* The librarian can use the catalogue to find out whether the library owns an item with a particular title or author, or that contains a short story, chapter, song, or poem with a particular title, or to compile a list of books by a particular author or on a particular subject.
* The librarian can briefly teach the user how to use the catalogue and how to use its advanced features, or recommend the proper subject words or terms that are used in the catalogue for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can often take the library user directly to the shelves with books on a certain topic without using the catalogue.
* The librarian is familiar with the contents of hundreds of [[reference work|reference book]]s, and can recommend books that might contain the answer to a particular question.
* The librarian can teach the library user to use online [[database]]s such as [[magazine]] and [[newspaper]] articles, and recommend words and search strategies for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can recommend reliable [[Website|web sites]], give advice on searching the Internet for information, and evaluate the reliability of the information on web sites.
* If the library doesn't have information on a given topic, or if the library user wants more information, the librarian can refer the library user to another library or to an organization that can be contacted by phone or mail.
*Offer aid with devices such as tablets and e-readers.  This can range from general assistance with questions on how to navigate e-reader and tablet devices to instructing classes.  Questions can vary from what devices are compatible with the library's e-book platform, how to check out books, and how to read electronic books.

==Staff qualifications==
In the [[United States]], those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; from a program accredited by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="librarian education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Librarians: How to Become a Librarian|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/librarians.htm#tab-4|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an "information desk."

In [[Sri Lanka]], librarians at reference desks typically have master's degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association's accredited programs.

==Electronic reference services==
With the development of the Web, [[Digital Reference Services|digital reference services]] are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i33/33a03701.htm  Are Reference Desks Dying Out?] by Scott Carlson, ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''
*: ''t̵'' – ''ter-'', ''tem-'', ''ten-''
*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===
{{Main|Medieval Unicode Font Initiative}}
In the [[Unicode]] Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html v. 5.1] (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1DC0.pdf "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement"] (26 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf "Latin Extended Additional"] (10 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf "Supplemental Punctuation"] (15 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10190.pdf "Ancient Symbols"] (12 characters) and especially [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf "Latin Extended-D"] (89 characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/ |title= MUFI: Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in [[LaTeX]] or using [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211642 overstrike] in MS Word).

Characters are "the smallest components of written language that have semantic value" but glyphs are "the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/ |title= The Unicode Consortium |publisher= Unicode, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HasekuraBookItalian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scipione Amati]]'s ''[[History of the Kingdom of Voxu]]'' (1615)  an example of a secondary source.]]
In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-perpetuation''', the capability of something to cause itself to continue to [[existence|exist]], is one of the main characteristics of [[life]]. [[Organism]]s' capability of [[reproduction]] leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. [[Population]]s self-perpetuate and grow. Entire [[ecosystem]]s show [[homeostasis]], and thus perpetuate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hilgardia|volume=39|issue=13|pages=367–404|doi=10.3733/hilg.v39n13p367|year=1968|title=Mechanisms of population homeostasis in Anagasta ecosystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|pmid=653514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slow modifying effect of [[succession (ecology)|succession]] and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecol. Appl. |year=2015 |volume=25|issue=8|pages=2051–68|title=The rise of novelty in ecosystems|pmid=26910939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by [[evolution]], a perfect [[steady state]] of the biological system is never reached. [[Sexual reproduction]] is also a form of imperfect [[self-replication]] and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] and [[mutation]]. Organisms are not like [[self-replicating machine]] but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.

In a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and (usually) [[positive feedback]] loops:
{{quote|To overcome strong prior [[beliefs]], strong evidence to the contrary is needed. If a person is predisposed to choosing a certain action, the advice from an advisor who sets a low threshold for recommending the alternative action is not of much use. The preference for like-minded advisors who supply coarse information implies that the advice a person receives is likely to
reinforce his existing [[priors]]. This effect can lead to polarisation of opinion and the [[emergence]] of self-serving beliefs. The learning process is prolonged and the induced short run bias can become perpetual if information is costly|Wing Suen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Self-Perpetuation of Biased Beliefs
|author=Wing Suen
|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on [[self-sustainability]], or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.

In computer science, [[self-reproducing program]]s constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in [[computer virus]]es which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.

In [[historiography]], distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts:

[[Primary source]]s are firsthand written [[evidence]] of history made at the [[time]] of the event by someone who was present.

--&gt; Physical objects can be primary sources.

===Secondary and tertiary===
{{main|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. 

[[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html Glossary, Using Information Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html |date=2008-08-28 }}. ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources".) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_" /&gt; These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are [[encyclopedia]]s and [[textbook]]s.

The distinction between  ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' is standard in [[historiography]], while the distinction between these sources and ''tertiary sources'' is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.

==Types==
Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with ''?''s are indeterminate.)

==In translation==
In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given [[Source language (translation)|source language]] which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a [[target text]] (TT), written in a given [[Target language (translation)|target language]]. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=67-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C. Kim |author3=T.E. Johson|editor=D. Ifenthaler |editor2=P. Isaias |editor3=J.M. Spector |editor4=K. D.G. Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G. Rijlaardsdam (Series Ed.)|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

'''''The Rough Guide to True Crime''''' is a non-fiction paperback reference guide to national and international true crime cases by American [[True crime|crime writer]] [[Cathy Scott]]. It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by [[Penguin Books]] through its [[Rough Guides]] imprint.

== Summary ==
''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/Cathy-Scott/The-Rough-Guide-to-True-Crime/6708060/ True crime Reviews: ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' (Book) by Cathy Scott (2009): reviews.waterstones.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book features [[serial killer]] [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], mob hitman [[Richard Kuklinski|Richard "The Iceman" Kuklinski]], [[John Wayne Glover]] "The Granny Killer," and British "Doctor of Death" [[Harold Shipman]].

Scott's story from ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' about mob enforcer [[Herbert Blitzstein]] was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, ''[[Masters of True Crime|Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebigthrill.org/2012/07/masters-of-true-crime-by-r-barri-flowers-editor/ ''The Big Thrill'' magazine, "Masters of True Crime by R. Barri Flowers (Editor)"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The author appeared on [[BlogTalkRadio]]'s "True Murder" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as "a different time in America, where people like [[Billy the Kid]] could walk in and just rob a bank" and get away with it. And while "there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/dan-zupansky1/2010/01/28/true-murder-episode-1-diane-fanning-baby-be-mine True Murder-Episode 3-Cathy Scott; ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' 01/27 by True Murder | Blog Talk Radio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The book was featured at [[BookExpo America]] 2009's trade fair in [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Publishing]]'s booth in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/trade-shows-events/article/14565-bookexpo-america-2009-around-the-bea-booths-c-d.html ''Publishers Weekly'': BookExpo America 2009: Around the BEA Booths: C - D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review, ''[[True Crime Zine|True Crime Book Reviews]]'' wrote, "From the Moors murders and Harold Shipman, to the murder of 2pac, this guide illuminates the psychology in play behind the most intriguing crimes in history, from the absurd to the appalling. ''The Rough Guide to True Crime'' explores the best of the haunting genre of True Crime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://truecrimebookreviews.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-true-crime-books-august-2009.html ''True Crime Book Reviews'': New True Crime Books August 2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''viz.''}}
{{Wiktionary|viz.|videlicet}}
The abbreviation '''''viz.''''' (or '''''viz''''' without a full stop), short for the Latin {{lang|la|'''videlicet'''|italic=yes|links=no}}, which itself is a contraction from Latin of '''''videre licet''''' meaning "it is permitted to see", is used as a synonym for "namely", "that is to say", "to wit", or "as follows". It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point. For example: "all types of data viz. text, audio, video, pictures, graphics etc. can be transmitted through networking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='videlicet', Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/videlicet?s=t|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Viz.'' is [[shorthand]] for the adverb ''{{lang|la|videlicet}}''. It uses [[Tironian notes]], a system of Latin shorthand developed {{circa|63 BCE}}. It comprises the first two letters, "vi", followed by the last two, "et", using the z-shaped [[⁊#Current|Tironian "et"]], historically written ⁊,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |last=Brewer  |first=Ebenezer |year=1970 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn= |page=1132 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to E.&amp;nbsp;Cobham Brewer (1810–1897), ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', the same abbreviation mark was used for "habet" and "omnibus".&lt;/ref&gt; a common contraction for "et" in Latin shorthand in [[Ancient Rome]] and [[medieval Europe]].

==Usage==
''Viz.'' is an [[abbreviation]] of ''videlicet'', which itself is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] from [[Latin]] of ''videre licet'' meaning "it is permitted to see".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|The New Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (revised third edition, 1998), pp. 825, 828.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''viz.'' is the continuation of an abbreviation using [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']] (''vi⁊''), the ''z'' replacing the ''⁊'' once the latter had fallen out of common use.

In contradistinction to [[i.e.]] and [[exempli gratia|e.g.]], viz. is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.

* ''Viz.'' is usually read aloud as "that is", "namely", or "to wit",&lt;ref name="AMHER1917"&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes pronounced as it is spelt, viz.: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|z}}.
* ''Videlicet'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref name="AMHER1917" /&gt;

===Examples===
* The main point of his speech, ''viz.'' that our attitude was in fact harmful, was not understood.
* "My grandfather had four sons who grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/148 ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin''] at Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The noble gases, viz., helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and radon, show an unexpected behavior when exposed to this new element.

==Compared with scilicet (sc., ss., §)==
{{Main|Section sign}}
A similar expression is '''''scilicet''''' (from earlier ''scire licet''), abbreviated as ''sc.'', which is Latin for "it is permitted to know". ''Sc.'' provides a parenthetic clarification, removes an  ambiguity, or supplies a word omitted in preceding text,&amp;nbsp; while ''viz.'' is usually used to elaborate or detail text which precedes it.

In legal usage, ''scilicet'' appears abbreviated as ''ss.'' or, in a caption, as [[Section sign|§]], where it  provides a statement of venue{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} and is read as "to wit".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (sixth edition, 1990), p. 1403.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scilicet'' can be read as "namely", "to wit", or "that is to say", or pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|iː|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}} or anglicized as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1560.&lt;/ref&gt;
